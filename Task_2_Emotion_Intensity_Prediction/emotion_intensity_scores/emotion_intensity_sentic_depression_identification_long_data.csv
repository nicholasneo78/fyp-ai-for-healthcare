Just another night. Another night of feeling lonely and just wondering what I did wrong in life to deserve this unhappiness. I have never felt a pain stronger than being rejected by the love of your life. The person who give you a purpose. The person who is supposed to make everything better. You would give your life for this person and they just do not love you anywhere near the same.,0.376
"Is it possible to fake depression? I have been feeling bad for about month now. There are period where I cry on a daily basis, I never feel like talking, I struggle concentrating and collecting thoughts, I feel such an extreme sadness inside of me also in happy situations, I am exhausted all the time even if I sleep hour straight, I often have headaches, I am completely alone and I find it difficult to do anything. There are night where it is unbearable. I think about my situation I am completely alone, I am failing at anything because I am so weak I cannot handle my feelings, I feel guilt for everything that happens around me, I cannot carry on anymore, I am always here in this dark place and I feel that I have no right to be like this. I used to self harm and I still have many scar on my skin, but I think to be disrespectful to those who truly struggle then I promised to cut never again. I should not have the right to do so. My life is void, I am void, and I cannot get the energy to do anything ever. I do not get pleasure from what I used to love, nothing seems to make me feel something good. I can enjoy no series, no book, no videogame like I used to. I think I do not even deserve to eat. I am just trying to pity myself giving myself depression, but I do not have it. Is it possible to fake depression? Could it actually be an excuse for me to not take responsibility of the failure that I am?",0.4726
"Imagine being attractive Imagine what it would be like to be desired, to have someone look at you not in disgust or ambivalence. It is all just a roll of the dice, It is too bad if you roll poorly you will be treated objectively worse. I wish I wa born attractive.. fuck",0.66
"Best moment to have anxiety It is am, I am tired, want to get up early, and guess what ? My brain decided this Instead of sleeping, why do not you become half crazy, thinking about your future should I say the lack of future ? . Here, have some craving for cigarettes, my pleasure, and of course i know you do not have cigarettes, do you think I am stupid ? The middle of the night is the best moment for thinking of smoking when you cannot smoke. Think of your loneliness. Think of you inexistant social life. You are and you have no job. You are living with your boring mother, with whom you literally quarel with every day. She probably think you are a piece of shit. You never had any girlfriend, and you probably will not. Almost , do not count on me to congratulate you.. Your only sunbeam will be at New year is Eve, when you will travel to see your best friends. But guess what, since you have no money at all, you probably will have to work to sell fu ng pastries, and because of that you will not be able to see your friends. Then you will continue to argue with your mother. Living on the couch. Selling pastries. In entire loneliness. God only know how long. The funny thing say my brain is this you are a loser, you lived and worked on your own not so long ago. But you are a child, you have the power to do what you want, where you want. You are , for God is sake, so why do not you move your as ? Leave me alone brain, I already know all that. I would be a king if I could. But I will not. Funny how despair can suck the marrow of your life, how even when you are ready to fall in the deepest pit, you have absolutely no will to catch the rope. TL DR FML. Have a good day night everyone !",0.16298
"hi, I am a year-old male from the uk, over the past few month I have become increasingly depressed. I am always acting the joker and appear to be happy at university and work but every night I go to bed and hope that I will not wake up in the morning. For the past or year I have had an overwhelming feeling that I will not live very long and over the past few month I have the sensation that I will die very soon. my depression also lead me to get very angered. I have never spoken to anyone about this.",0.51067

"I wa just curious what your feeling are on long-term outcome for depression. A little background for me I have been on and off medicine for several years. I wa always depressed a a child, but did not really seek professional help until maybe year ago. I originally went on medicines. for severe pm prescribed to me by my ob-gyn. I just kind of continued on with it because it made me feel leveled out . Then I had issue with sleep apnea, joint pain etc. My neurologist put me on Effexor. Every time I tried to go off that drug I wa dizzy and had bad side effects. Finally, I reduced the dose myself and weaned myself off the Effexor. I had gained a tremendous amount of weight. I wa off all medicine for month and then I really feel into a dark depression. It wa then that I sought a therapist, etc. I have been on medicine ever since..since June of . I had lost pound by going off the medicines, but then became depressed again. following several death and major life events. I wa put on Lexapro and gained weight. Not wanting to gain weight again, I hated being on the medicines. He kept saying it will stabilize. I told him that the weight gain wa making me more depressed. Finally, he changed my medicine to Wellbutrin. We talked about trying to go off medicine when life event settled down..my main reason to go off wa the weight gain. Immediately the weight came back off. That wa a year ago. Now a year later, I am still losing about a pound or two a month. The last time I went in, he did not say anything about going off the medicines. How long do people take medicines? Is it just better to stay on them and not fall back into the hole? Are there any long-term use side effect to be concerned with? Is this something I will probably be on forever? It just seems like I will always be like this. It just seems like depression is always just standing back in the shadows. I go for a very long time and feel fine and then I have a week where I get very down and know that if I wa not on medicines. it would be very bad. I have not gone to talk to my therapist in a long while. When I am having these bout of depression, should I call and say I need to go in for a check-up . I do not really have any specific issue to discuss. The big thing right now is I just feel down because I have lost my closest friend and do not feel like I have any friend to do anything with. I feel so isolated. Would it be good to just call and go in? I just feel stupid saying I feel sad because I do not have any friends. Are there any good book that you can recommend on self-help--esp. negative thinking, understanding why I think the way I do, etc. I found Dr. Phil is book on Life Strategies to be very helpful in discovering that there are reason why I do thing and think.",0.4790100000000001
"My hearing, attentiveness and social awareness ha been completely off since dropping into a very low depressive period a of late. Normal? Walking through a busy shopping center today and I feel heavy and zoned out. I ordered food at a bakery and could barely hear my voice a I spoke. I did not hear the employee very well and unknown to me like high school kid entered a I wa browsing and I did not even notice until I visually saw them. The sunlight drain me quick.

"Hello out there.. Ugh. I battle with depression, anxiety, bulimia, OCPD, BPD, and some physical health issues. Not so sure about battle right now. Maybe more like grudgingly coexist with? I am . I have never held a job with the same company for longer than years, and that wa just once. A few time I think I have made it to the year mark with a company. year is a bit easier. I had to quit my last job because it wa too easy to use the job to fuel the eating disorder. I lost of my starting weight in about months, before I switched phase and ended up with a pulmonary embolism from refeeding syndrome. Right now I am in the initial hurry up and deny me so I can get an attorney phase of applying for disability. Thankfully I have a sister who is letting me live in her house, so at least I am not homeless. TBH, most of the time she is out of the country, and when she is here, she is just a selectively social a I am. Because of waiting to get on disability, I am off my medicine. I cannot even afford the cheapest ACA insurance, and even if I had that, I could not afford the copays for my medicine. I am not eligible for Medicaid in my state until I get approved for SSI SSDI. I am not too worried about not having my antidepressant right now tho. This is probably the most pleasant major depressive episode I have ever had. It is not so much feeling horrible psychic pain a it is just been a gentle bleeding out of the vibrancy of life. I sleep a late a I can every day, usually until around or so , hang out in bed playing games, reading, or watching videos, and only really waking up and being willing to be awake around in the evening. I do not feel like I am living anymore. I am just in a holding pattern. I think back to what my life wa like, even month ago, and I mourn for it. At least I am not suicidal.

Currently waiting at the hospital to be seen If I do not get treatment I am going to kill myself. No one in my daily life cares. My sister and my mom did not give a shit. My abusive boyfriend dumped me today and told me never to contact him again. I feel broken. I do not want to live in society anymore. I want to live in a hospital ward and not have to think.

"Hi. I am new to the forums. I wa going to lurk for a bit before I posted, but there is so many of us, I mean, I knew. but I did not know.. you know? it seems like the thing to do. I am a year old male and I have had problem with depression for a long a I can remember, though it is become worse over the last year or so. I wa pretty heavily involved in music and martial art for years, but I am no longer motivated to do either. I am still going to school, though Hi. I am new to the forums. I wa going to lurk for a bit before I posted, but there is so many of us, I mean, I knew. but I did not know.. you know? it seems like the thing to do. I am a year old male and I have had problem with depression for a long a I can remember, though it is become worse over the last year or so. I wa pretty heavily involved in music and martial art for years, but I am no longer motivated to do either. I am still going to school, though I have no real direction and I am afraid that my lack of motivation is going to cause me to screw that up too. I started having anxiety attack about a year ago and they have increased in frequency the last few months. They are not to sound melodramatic the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with. If I am in panic-attack mode, any slight pain or discomfort quickly becomes a life-threatening illness that is surely going to kill me in the next few minutes. As ridiculous a that sounds, it is absolutely real when it is happening and I live in almost constant fear it is going to happen again. I have a hard time even driving anymore especially on the freeway and increasingly rely on my girlfriend for menial thing like going to the store. She is very supportive and is aware that something is wrong, though I do not think she understands to what extent. I have started completely avoiding any situation in which I have to meet new people and have a hard time even talking to people I do not know on the phone. These symptom have been increasing in intensity over the last month or so and exponentially for the last week I just lost my job . It seems like quite a few of you have been dealing with these sort of thing for much longer and I am sorry if my posting here so soon seems insensitive, but it already getting to the point where I know I cannot handle living like this for year on end. I have suffered from depression for relative to my age a long time and the anxiety attack are absolutely terrifying a little redundant, I know . It feel like the last year is the beginning of everything completely falling apart. I guess my posting here is a way to get the ball rolling towards getting some help. I do not have health insurance anymore and I am not sure where to go from here. I have been medicated in the past, but I have not taken anything in a few years. Though, without insurance I am not even sure that is an option. That is enough for now. Thanks for providing a resource like this.

"An Open Letter Dear you, It is been three year since we decided to go our separate ways. We both had different goals, desire and aspirations. We were perfect together, but just at the wrong time. I am sorry thing ended badly. I am sorry that for month after they spiraled out of control. I am sorry. I am sorry I let you down, your family down. I am sorry I buckled. I am sorry I did not have the experience or the know-how to react to certain situations. I am sorry that I made mountain out of molehills. I am sorry at time I treated you badly, that at time I held you back. Three year later, we live totally different life than back then. I got that job. I traveled the world. I went to Italy - twice. I have been to Times Square at midnight, and so have you. I did it all, but by myself. It is not what I wanted. It is not what I envisioned. You cannot just replace somebody special with another person, and that you were. Special. It is been three years. Despite some triumph and successes, it still feel like I lost a war. An immense failure that did not personify my persona, it personified myself. On the surface, I am told I seem ambitious, fully ready to attack each day. On the inside, I feel defeated. In the end, you found somebody new, which is fine. I chose, whether consciously or unconsciously to stay on a different path. I have tried new women. Many beautiful on the outside, but they are not you. Oh no, no, no. They all do not have what you had. Not even close. Maybe one day I will end this crusade against myself, against the past. I cannot change it, I cannot alter the story, I cannot lie to myself. I wish I could tell you I am sorry. But it would not change anything. For you it is a battle that wa fought long ago. For me, I relive it more time than I would care to admit. I am emotionally crippled, distraught, defeated. It is been a long three years. I am ready for it to be over. I am sorry. Yours truly, Me.",0.0

"I just really need to vent.. For a start, I understand everyone in life are at different level and that depression and anxiety is different for everyone and I am in no way stating who ha it worst or better. I have taken hour and hour of training in it and I am not here to speak or preach about how to help.. In a rare occasion in my life I am asking for help, guidance, I do not know the correct word but maybe if I explain myself a bit it may help. This maybe long and I do apologize but I just need to say all of this SOMEWHERE.. I am gay guy that recently moved from a conservative town in Montana to the amazing city of Portland, OR. I came out of the closet the summer going into my freshman year of high school, dealt with a simply put shitty childhood while growing up in the Bible Belt of northern Florida, with an abusive father and worrying, even at the age of about how my future would play out in this. My mom divorced and remarried a man that doe not accept my sexuality personally but support my life decision and say he love me. We moved to Montana my mom, me and him and I began to feel like I did have a purpose when I wa introduced to acting onstage at a local theatre that I fell in love with. Life, for a few years, wa amazing but my high school at the time wa having a crisis. Unfortunately four student had committed suicide between my freshman and junior year and, with the help of many, started a suicide awareness program in the city and lead that for a year or so. My senior year, literally three day before it started, my military brother committed suicide on base, it wa suspected it wa also his sexuality. But also in my senior year, near the end of it, I met a man whom I fell in love with which is what I am getting too, just bare with me . We were able to spend a lot of time together for a month or two before he had to leave to Portland before I had gone for a work internship where he would go back home to Brazil once completed. He treat me like gold, and I really mean that, he ha been nothing but amazing to me. He flew me out to Portland so I could visit him for two week where we fell even more in love. Everything wa shattered when he left for home and I also left for an adventure. After I graduated, I had the amazing opportunity to go to the BEAUTIFUL island of Taiwan, where I spent an amazing year learning Chinese Mandarin , meeting people all around the world, experiencing a new culture for the first time, it wa indeed a life changing time for me. But it wa not easy for my boyfriend and I. We fought in occasion, texting make it really hard to communicate emotions, and we only had about two hour out of our day to talk due to the harsh time zone differences. The year went by quite quickly and he surprised me with yet another plane ticket to Portland where he would also land only two hour after I did and we would be together again. It wa only for two week again but I felt complete.. He even proposed on the Fourth of July. He wa yanked away from me again soon after and it tore me down. My heart crumbled. My next chapter in life had started once I arrived back from Taiwan and had seen my boyfriend again. I had decided I wanted to move to a Portland permanently, found a decent student housing apartment, enrolled for school, I wa excited.. now this is where thing become a bit much for me and why I am here today. My, now fianc , wa able to stay with me for a full month this time. Now at this point I am sure you wonder if you are still reading , why doe not he move here?, or why do not you move there? Here is why He wa on an exchange program when I met him that the Brazilian government paid for. The requirement for that visa is that he must stay in Brazil for two year before he can legally move back into the USA. In other words, he is stuck there while I am stuck here both separated and both in fear of him being rejected. We applied for the fianc visa and now we are waiting for the approval. I refuse to move where he life because of how high the crime rate is and due to Brazil is economic status, we both agreed it would not be good for a white American target to live in a high crime area. I know I have talked a lot about my fianc but here is also what is going on on my hand a well that I just wa not ready for. Before I moved to Portland, I had to go to urgent care because I had no primary doctor and no money, only Medicaid, which they took. I went three time for small bump on my hand that turned out to be stressed induced and all three time I went the doctor said I have no idea! Try using lotion and see what happens! Nodded their head and left. Very pointless but when I got the bill I wa shocked and confused. I thought my Medicaid had covered it, which it did not because while I wa out of country my Medicaid had expired and no one told me about it, therefore I wa left with a bill. I heard it off for a while because I had other thing to deal with than the bullshit that the hospital wa giving me about it. Around this time a well, I moved in with my best friend due to a dispute I had with my parents, which really crumbled me, but they still do not know how upset I am about it. I moved to Portland.. and now I believe I am regretting it.. I moved with that same best friend where we would also share the space with two others, a couple from Hawaii. We had Skyped then ahead of time in our excitement of moving and we were all excited to meet each other. I had a job lined up for me a a barista, I had a saving plan lined up for what I could and could not spend for money, school would be starting soon, thing were looking pretty nice! Well.. it is not nice. Not nice at all. The Hawaiian couple doe not like my friend and I. They stop our oven mitten and tried to say they were there is and hid them from us, refused to let u use the garbage can in the kitchen, and held little meeting about what it is we were doing wrong and how we could fix it.. I wa so thrown back I ignore them at any chance and even had to take time out of my life to tell them how upsetting it is we had reached a level where they had to actually put sticky note on thing we could touch and could not touch. I find myself to be quite tidy and clean and fair but I guess there are two side of the story always. That is the first thing. That job I had lined up a a barista? Big joke.. I met with the bos who said the store is not open yet and asked if I wanted to be a cashier for the university instead. I said why not, the pay wa amazing at . an hour and had benefits. I did my on-boarding and wa quite interested. First day on the job however they lied and put me in food service where I wa demanded around by two chef and four manager who did not know what the fuck they were doing. One of the chef is actually spilt boiling grease on my foot and did not even apologize. The other chef wa racist and talked bad about the Indian worker so much I had to leave his presence. It wa a toxic environment. Income tax in Oregon wa so high I wa not able to afford my apartment and realized I need to be working minimum wage to sincerely support myself here. I left after a month and am now struggling on finding a full time again. On a side note, because of cost and issue with finding a co-signed for a loan, I had to pull my enrollment for school a well. That is the second.. When my fianc came to visit me for a month, my best friend roommate wa very difficult.. it is a harsh word to use but she ha a lot of learning to do. I have been on my own since I wa in doing thing myself with the exception of paying my phone bill and buying a car . Taxes, jobs, appointments, etc., were all me. She need some help getting there and she ha done and amazing job to get there but.. every opportunity I hand her to take one more step of becoming independent she reject and shuts down completely. The whole month wa very hard for my fianc and I over how jealous and upset she got and it wa too much. Currently she is back home for Christmas and I am alone and quite frankly I needed it. I just do not know how to handle that situation. It wa a if she wa using her emotion against me and it wa poisonous. It go so bad my fianc and Igor an Airbnb our last two night together so it could just be me and him. That is the third.. I had to go to the emergency room a well when my fianc wa here due to yet another kidney stone. I got one in the th grade, near the end of my exchange program and one in a restaurant where the pain wa so bad I needed to call an ambulance.. more money on shit I cannot afford. I can go on and on with these story but I need to get to this.. it is my anxiety. I wa diagnosed with depression in high school but wa taken off of medication. I wa doing actually quite well! But most recently, with everything that is been going on, it is gotten really really bad. I am constantly anxed about everything.. when I walk down the street, I fear what people look at me as. Now I am not fat, I would say I am average but my cheek are so puffy and it really embarrasses me to even look in a mirror. I am constantly wondering why my fianc want to be with me, if he is cheating on me, lied to me, etc. I over stress about the smallest smallest things. Example I cried and broke down because I failed my driver test for the Oregon license. I physically felt like I wa going to die or the end of the world wa happening.. why? Why wa that happening to me? Why is this ALL happening to me? I miss my fianc , I cannot get stable, I now starting out a an adult is not supposed to be easy but guys.. this is really hard. I spend any day I have off in bed and I have only had one meal within two days. I know I need help but I do not have the money for it or the time. I have never felt this insecure about my life, future, body, everything. I feel like I am climbing up an escalator that is going the wrong way, and no amount of running will get me to the top. I do not know where else to go or who to talk to. I feel like I have annoyed everyone already enough about me that I no longer want to talk to literally anyone. My fianc sometimes even. Well if you have made it this far I thank you sincerely.. I just really needed to vent.",0.0

When she went back to get his consent over phone to get picked up for the ambulance, he wa out cold already. Lips purple, cold, lifeless. It had been only - minute since she last saw him, alive, or whatever wa left of his life. I wa there to see a fresh dead corpse. My dad. My dad.

"I have no friend This is not an over dramatic statement. I truly have no friends. Throughout the year I have grown a part from people and I have distanced myself from people I felt were toxic. I have had my heart broken by a few friends. But right now I am sitting here looking at this funny meme I wanted to share and I realized I have no one to send it to. I hope all of this make sense one day. Goodnight Edit Wow, I did not expect this response! It is comforting to know I am not alone. We are all in this together amp I feel happy to know I am a part of a sub with so many caring, kind people. If any of you need a friend or just need someone to talk to, I am here. Thank you all for sharing your story and responding. The meme is quite funny, I am going to try to send it to everyone who asked. Cheers",0.24470999999999998
"Constant battle between ambition and not wanting to live. Since I wa about I have had recurring suicidal thoughts. The thing is, I do not have low self esteem or anything of that sort, it is actually quite the opposite and I always joke about being a narcissist. I may not be an actual narcissist, but I have always had a slight superiority complex. I do not hate myself, but I just hate my life and the continuous chore known a living. On the outside, I have always been the life of the party, but deep down I do not ever remember being happy. As someone who is highly ambitious, it feel a if there is a never ending struggle between wanting to be successful enough to be well known or have an impact on the world, and wanting to stop existing. Yet with the prospect of the latter, come the failure of the former. I know that if I lowered my expectation in life I would be mildly happier, yet the thought of settling for mediocrity give me horrible anxiety and fill me with dread. Recently thing have gotten worse due to my university workload. I have been having trouble completing assignment and functioning in general. I have considered getting help but I feel deeply uncomfortable at the thought of opening up to someone, since I am not a very emotional person. I have come to accept that I will probably never be happy. I have always wondered if I would be more likely to actually commit suicide if I ever attained the level of success I desire since I would have then achieved my goal in life, or if that would finally bring me the contentment I seek. I suppose it would be the former since I can never be content.",0.36338

"A letter to my sister, who ha conquered her depression The letter you always wanted to write.. Family stuff happened and those wound in you festered and festered. No one knew at the beginning. You hid it well under your sleeve and at the back of your eyes. Before it all happened, I sometimes looked at you and thought that this would happen to you. It is the way you used to hold your emotion. It is a if you were full to the brim with it, but you forced it down, shoved it into a box and hid it away. It wa strange, but I wa too young to understand. And then, slowly but surely, it took you over. You were so young. In my worst nightmare I imagined finding your lifeless body. I could not wake you up. You would not wake up. My darling sister, even now I still imagine your cold body. How can such a deathly and frightening disease exist? You wasted away. Your cheek were concave, and you did not even have to bend over for every bone of your spine to be visible. Your sharp wit and intelligent mind dulled. Your eye were dark hole in your face. They were so empty. You slept all afternoon and night. I would lay my cardigan over you so you would not get cold. But I do not think it made a difference. You were lost to us, floating in some different universe with no anchor or thread holding you to us. And then you tried to end it all. Multiple times. When I think about it, I blame you sometimes. But I know that the blame is not really towards you. It is towards me, of course. I am your sister. I should have been your protector. Is it OK if I say that I could not really do anything but stand there and watch it run it course? Or is that just an excuse? You are my best friend, even though I am not always yours. I wish I would be kinder to you, but I probably will always hold some of myself away. Maybe I am punishing myself. I do not know. No one can say it did not take a toll on all of us. You probably do not remember, but we were going to the corner shop together once. As we chatted, you were vehement that you were a failure. I asked you, what on earth were you a failure at? What life had you lived that you possibly could have failed? And you said I failed at life. So what wa the alternative, my dear? Death? I am telling you, I lived those few year in the fear that you would be taken away from u by your own hand. Even a I am writing this, I do not know where to start or end. In my mind, it is such a mess. It doe not matter because you are well now. I have never seen someone work harder. You are radiant and beautiful and clever and sarcastic and so special I could not tell you how much if I tried. I hope you will always appreciate the battle you have fought and won. I hope you always believe you are a success. I wish you all the happiness you deserve. Love you, babe. Your sister",0.0

"Falling back into it I am , and this weekend, I got into a big argument with my girlfriend of months. We had not seen each other in weeks, and our plan to see each other fell through. I tried to save our plans, but she seemed disinterested. I wa so distraught and caught up in sadness and self-hatred that I, wanting to distance myself from the situation, not just leaving it alone, told her I wanted to break up with her out of sheer emotional irrationality. It turn out I wa sadder without her, and she reached out to me to talk soon later. We got back together, and she said she wa okay. The way she described the whole situation let me know she understood my plight completely, but I ruined her that day and she is been off ever since. She painted her nail black, screamed at her parents, texted all her friend to tell them how much of a terrible person I was, wrote Anon is a piece of shit cunt in her bathroom mirror in sharpie, and cried all day from the story she told.

"I am losing the girl I have been with for year and it is because of my drug use, really bummed I have been with this girl since th grade I am now and I can honestly say I love her with my whole heart. I have been abusing drug of all variety since I wa , herion, meth, pills, uppers, downers, alcohol, marijuana, research chemicals, it doe not matter, but I prefer if it fit into a syringe. I have been to rehab time since I wa I would get sober then relapse sober then relapse sober etc.. I have had legal trouble and been in and out of jail she ha been with me through it all, she ha always been my better half. No word can explain how blessed I have been to have her. This past relapse I wa clean for two year before hand and our relationship had never been better we were both happy we both trusted and we both loved no matter what. She helped me get my g.e.d. And she helped me through my grandfather death he raised me . I had subtle depression over it I felt like that wa normal losing a loved one and all, but I eventually stopped doing the thing I wa susposed to to maintain my sobriety, I felt like I wa cured and no longer needed all the recovery stuff. I wa wrong. So one day I decided to take some benzodiazepine and that made me go straight to crystal meth in the time frame of a week I wa back shooting meth spending all of my money on it and staying up for days. When on meth I have serious delusion I accused her of cheating on me I actually believed these delusion with my whole heart I felt so betrayed and hurt, I wanted to die. What I feel like really did it wa I accused her of cheating on Facebook. Even after multiple people telling me I wa wrong I could not believe it, I just KNEW everybody wa out to get me especially her, I wa very unfair and called her name and called her at all hour of the night, completely out of character of me. After being the good loving boyfriend she know and love for two year I suddenly became a monster. I totaled the vehicle I owned and went to jail for possession with intent Benzodiazepines possession of marijuana and dui. I sat there for two month thank god while I wa in there she told me she just could not do this with me anymore and told me she ha somebody else in her life, this crushed me. I contemplated suicide while I wa in there fought anybody that even remotely rubbed me the wrong way and lost my appetite could not sleep. So I get out and I know that I should just stay away from her because I love her and I do not want to hinder her pursuing something else, I respected her decision to move on, after all I did publicly humiliate her. So right now I have been sober a month and I feel good in a clear minded healthy way, but I have this hole where she used to be I find myself riding around for hour thinking and crying. I am very upset that I let this happen, currently I just cannot keep my mind off of her I just want our love and friendship back. I am very depressed and lately I have thought about using again but I would rather kill myself before I do that, I cannot get high anymore I would honestly rather be dead.

I thought i wa almost over my depression, I thought i wa getting better, but the thing he ha said ha taken me from where I thought I wa all the way back down to extremely emotional and having suicidal thoughts. The argument started because I wa talking too loudly to his son while trying to correct his behaviour. I am week pregnant, and lately have been easily annoyed and upset by the boy not listening to me. My husband called me a bunch of hurtful thing because I tried to explain why I wa so upset. Later on in the night he told me my mom and oldest sister were no longer allowed to visit me for the birth of our child. Then he spent several more hour talking about how they were rot gut whore and how he doe not want them around HIS son all because year ago my sister invited me to a christmas dinner she knew I wasnt going to show up for and did not specifically include my husband in the invitation. Yet his mom is coming a few week after, and she had left him and his brother to fend for themselves in a trailer in the middle of a forest only showing up to bring them food when they called her and begged her for it. But because she ha not done anything to offend me, he is totally ok with her showing up. Now he is talking about how if I want my mom to be here so bad, I can leave with her when she visits. And I have fully expressed how depressed I am to him and he is not even worried in the slightest. He just keep refering to my past a a teen who would sleep with practically anyone to try to get some sort of pleasure out of life, saying he bet I want to go back to that, that i would treat his son better if he were black, and that i would try harder to not upset my husband if he were black.

"this is my first post. I am , and a half month pregnant dealing with depression anxiety. I have taken antidepressant off and on for a few year but stopped this summer because my husband and I were trying to conceive. My pregnancy ha been pretty rough this time around .. I have an year old son . I have had joint problems, severe morning sickness .. and terrible depression anxiety. My husband just doe not understand what I am going through .. he think that I am being hateful or sad on purpose. He contributes to a lot of the way that I feel. He told me early in the pregnancy, that if something wa to happen and I lose the baby or it wa born with something wrong with it, he would have a hard time not blaming me for it even if the doctor said that nothing could have prevented it. This wa said to me because I wa not taking my prenatal vitamin at the time because of the morning sickness. I could see if I were using drug or drinking but I do not do those things. I do not understand his thinking on that subject. My mother in law is another person getting on my nerves. She come over uninvited and give out unwanted advice. She also ha a way of making me angry with her thoughtless comment which are hurtful and unnecessary. I cannot talk to my husband about this because he would see me a the bad guy . Sometimes I just want to be alone .. away from people .. I feel like I do not have any privacy anymore. My husband always make me feel worse when I talk to him about how I feel. I do not know why he aggravates me to talk to him then always say .. Well, you ought to be thankful .. rrblah rrblah rrblah . It is not like I do not know that I could have it worse .. but he never care what I feel at that moment. I guess I better shut up .. I have ranted long enough .. although I feel like I could go on forever .. so sorry for the long post ..",0.44317

To an outsider, my life seems okay I am married to a great guy, I have a good job that pay well, my family is healthy and I have friends. To me, my life is unbearable. I am not ungrateful and I really do appreciate everything that I have in my life, but it is very hard for me to get out of bed in the morning and live out my day. One of my main problem is my weight. I know this may seem vain to some of you, but it is a huge problem for me, someone who already struggle with low self esteem. I have gained about lb in a year, and I cannot control what I eat, nor can I motivate myself to work out. I do not recognize myself anymore, none of my old clothes fit, and I cannot seem to be able to do anything about it. Every day, I tell myself, I will eat healthy, I will make better decisions, I will not hate myself, I will not speak down to myself, etc.. Each and every day, I fail. This kill me. My second problem is that I have a well paying job but it is very stressful and demanding. It take up the majority of my day and this stress feed into my poor eating habits. I have considered quitting but I cannot justify saying no to the money. I am scared that if I quit to try to focus on myself, I will just eat more and more because I will be le busy.

"Hi everyone! I have been trying to find something or someone to help me out depression for ages, but I am not an open person and it is been very difficult for me. I wa never happy with my life and been just running away from problems. I left home when I wa and went to London. I wanted to start new life, but moved time since then and always hoped I will be happy in the new place. But it is getting worse and worse, I am back home now, and start to realize, that I have nowhere to run and I am getting old for that. I had a best friend in London, but she just used me and left when my ex went to jail. I have no one to talk to and I found so difficult to find new friends. I never talk about my problems, just to myself, when I am with people, I am completely different person, I am so shy and I hate it. I hate it when I want to say something, but my mind doe not let me and I am just upset on myself. I do not remember the morning, when I woke up with a good mood or without headache. I have been thinking so much, that even when I stop I still feel this horrible pain in my head. I tried to bring my confidence up with drugs, but they just made it worse and I feel even more depressed. I have been thinking everyday. What am I going to do? and what is the worse about all this is that when I decide something what I feel is right and in few hour or minute I think about it again and my feeling change and change again. ..it is driving me crazy. I am getting so sensitive on everything, I am cry from watching a stupid cartoon, or listening to the music, I feel sick or strange high on everything I put in my mouth. I think I have lost myself, I cannot see the point of life anymore. Suicide? I tried that, but now I am afraid of death, I am afraid of everything. I would be glad if I could find some friend here.. at least one, who understand and could beat this depressive mood with me. Love, Angela,",0.39694
"I have had a rough time of thing lately, which is partly what made me search for this site. I have had recurrent unipolar depression since my mid teen with an associated anxiety disorder and a panic disorder that took root year ago after I beat a drink problem I had at the time between the age of and I used alcohol a a bit of a crutch which wa a huge mistake . Anyway these day I am teetotal, on anti depressant and only really get a bad time with my depression A during the winter month or B if something trigger an episode circumstantial . Usually it lift up in the summer month I think I might get a bit of SAD but last year my mother passed away on the rd of March and it caused a huge crash in my mood which never lifted in time before the winter episode took hold. I dealt with it by comfort eating I do comfort eat at times, but I also get bad food craving in the winter for food such a chocolate, cheese and carbohydrates, so pizza and chocolate ice-cream became my regular fodder for a while . Anyway that lead to weight gain which is besides the point but which I wa planning on correcting a I have done before this summer when the food craving wear off and my mood lifted. Unfortunately it is not lifted a of yet due to recent circumstances. Not only did I have the first anniversary of my mother is death to deal with, but my partner whom I loved very much decided that this would be the best time to dump me and completely rip me to shred in the process. He basically emailed he life in another city a few day before the anniversary of her death saying he wanted to end it. I tried to contact him but he would not talk on the telephone or by voice, and would not respond to any email I sent him. He then contacted me by IM on the day of her anniversary rd March to rip me to shred and tell me that he could not love someone like me before posting publicly on his journal running me down before posting disturbing reply to some of the post on my journal anonymously but I recognized his ISP number so I know it wa him even though he denied it making it sound a though the whole thing wa deliberate. I would not mind but it came out of the blue, the night before all this started he wa discussing a work transfer to move to where I am and signed off with I love you . Next day, wham. I am social phobic so do not really have many friend I cant talk to about this, my mother wa usually the one id turn to but she is not here anymore, so my mood, although it usually lift at this time of year, ha taken a nose dive and I am having trouble getting myself motivated again. The emotional pain I felt on that Thursday wa like nothing I had felt for years, I just literally felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest. I could not sleep and I could not eat for the best part of that week, although I am eating and sleeping again now. Am I over reacting to what he did, because I am hurt a hell and completely and utterly infuriated with him at the same time? I know I can be slightly prone to being a bit of a drama queen at time over reacting to stuff and I can sometimes be a little paranoid. But the whole thing felt deliberate a though he intentionally intended to hurt me, and even now when I try to contact him to get answer he is being spiteful and running me down. Of course after this I spat a whole load of vitriol at him and now I am being painted a the one that wa in the wrong, and he is saying he did nothing that warranted the vitriol and is the innocent party in all of this. Of course he also interprets home truth a vitriol, and I tend to be very open and say thing a I see them, to the point of lacking tact now and again. But whilst I am willing to stand up and say I made a few mistake and apologize, he is acting a though the blame is all mine and he did nothing wrong. I just cannot seem to make him understand that the way he went about ending the relationship wa one of the most hurtful way anyone could have done it. I know he claim to suffer from bipolar disorder which he wont get treatment for, and I know that can make him highly moody, but I cant understand why he doe not understand the hurt he caused me, or if he does, how someone who professed to love me, doe not even seem to care. He seems totally and utterly cold, so cold it is chilling. I know he get period of emotional flatness because he told me, and he also told me he hears voice a well. Could he be suffering from some kind of depression related psychosis? One post he made to my journal wa Wisdom come only to those who seek it, and sometimes to those who deserve it regardless of perfection, intent or even understanding. The common denominator though, seems to be deed. For one must do, or be done to, in order for wisdom to take root. Am I misreading that? Or reading into it? So am I over reacting? Was I wrong to argue back with him? How can I move on and get my motivation back again?",0.30095
"Going to bed in the morning, waking up at night. For about a year now, I have been going to sleep in the morning when the rest of my family is getting ready to start their day and getting out of bed in the evening night. It started because I transferred to online school and I thought it would be fine to stay up until am or so, but it is gradually gotten worse and worse and a I am typing this it is am and I am just now getting ready to sleep. I am guessing I will wake up at about pm and actually get out of bed at . It is really screwing with my coursework and making my mental and physical health worse. People keep giving me reasonable advice like turning off distraction and forcing myself to go to bed, or even staying up the whole day so I am very tired by nighttime, but I just cannot find the willpower to go to sleep or get up.

I went on medication after a few months, and thing improved, but it is something i still deal with every day. I am at university full time, a well a working part time, and just feel like i am constantly on the edge of going insane. I just moved to a new city, and feel so lonely, wanting attention but i feel like no one is interested. Worst of all, i miss so much university because i cannot get out of bed in the morning that my tutor regard me a a bad student, which make me feel so bad, because i know i am smarter than most of the people in our class. I just want everyone to know i am not lazy and boring, i just feel like my body is made of lead and i have no energy and no drive to get up in the morning. I have just started seeing a psychologist and she is really great, but it is so expensive i have to work extra shift at work just to manage, which make me even more stressed out! I do not want to take time off university because i took last year off and it made me feel worse.

"Hi, I am pretty sure I am suffering from depression, and probably have been for the last month or so. It is only been lately that I feel like the rug ha really been jerked out from under me, though. I think it started in mid- when I became seriously ill. Between June and September , I spent three week in the hospital, umpteen visit to the E R, and finally, major surgery to correct the problem. Physically, I am fine now. But we had no health insurance long story , and when the hospital bill started rolling in, we tried our best to pay the bills, but there wa just no way. We ended up filing bankruptcy, I lost my home business, and we very nearly lost our home. Ever since then, I have felt like I am falling down a dark tunnel, even though the bankruptcy is over with. I wa drinking part of this time, but have stopped, thinking that may have been causing the problem. But it is actually become worse since I have stopped. Here is my symptom I do not usually have trouble falling asleep, but I cannot seem to stay asleep for more than a couple of hours. It is hard to go back to sleep, so I usually just get up. Weight gain because I find myself eating even when I am not hungry. The comfort food thing, I guess. I tend to be a stress eater, and goodness know I have had a lot of that lately! I used to enjoy camping and reading book etc. , but I do not care about any of that anymore. I could not sit down now and read a book no matter how much I wanted to. I get through or pages, and totally lose interest. That is depressing in itself, because I used to love reading so much. I have no desire to get out and do anything. I literally close myself up in my spare bedroom every waking hour, only coming out to use the bathroom and to fix supper for my husband. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I am not happy, but I cannot pinpoint exactly what would make me happy. I honestly cannot think of anything. I have no energy whatsoever. I have been dealing with a TON of guilt over the bankruptcy. After all, the bankruptcy would not have happened if I had not gotten sick, you know? I feel horrible for dragging my husband is credit down along with mine, but the way thing were, I could not file bankruptcy by myself. Our credit wa PERFECT until I got sick. My husband sold a bunch of his personal belonging to help pay bills, a did I, but it wa so unfair for him to have lost his stuff on account of me. He is never once complained, but I still feel terrible. I have also been kicking myself for the loss of my home business. I cannot help but feel like if it had not failed I could not keep up with it during my illness , that we would not have had to file bankruptcy. I have never been a crier, but I sure feel like it sometimes. I cannot seem to do anything right these days. Irritable!! Throwing stuff, being unreasonable, getting mad about petty things. The one thing I have not experienced thankfully is suicidal thoughts. A few random morbid thought here and there, but nothing I would ever act on. Last night I took several online self-tests, and all of them said I had mild to moderate depression. One even said severe. I guess the next step would be to go to the doctor, but I do not have a doctor. My sister is taking Zoloft for panic attack and a PMS disorder, so I guess I will ask her who she is seeing. What do they do .. just ask question similar to the online questionnaires? Or? I have been reading about all the different kid of medicines, and found the information about Wellbutrin to be the most interesting. Obviously the doctor would know what I need better than I would, but I sure do not want to take something that is going to make me gain even more weight or feel like a zombie. At least one good thing, though. We do, thankfully, have insurance now. Another issue is my husband and family. To them, depression is something that people should be able to just shake off . They do not understand that I CAN T seem to shake it off , otherwise, I gladly would. My husband is supportive in other ways, but he scoffed when my sister started taking Zoloft. To them, if they cannot see the problem, it doe not exist. I am sure they do not mean to be mean , but they just do not understand. Sorry for rambling. Any suggestion or thoughts?",0.35757

"How is it going, all who read. My name is Greg, I am and have had depression for basically a long a I remember. Here is a brief history of my journey through depression and the treatment I have endeavored. I began on lexapro. It seemed to be helping and then it quit on me or perhaps vice versa . After that I tried zoloft, and wellbutrin, but to the same effect. Then I turned my world to narcotic mainly, marijuana and DXM . They helped ALOT, but because they are illegal, I felt a constant public stigma and guilt. I could not take it, despite the amazing effect of both drugs. I am now taking Paxil CR, but I am going to quit it because it is not working. I am beginning to lose hope altogether. It seems apparent to me that SSRIs just are not for me, or maybe I just have not found the right one. The real problem with depression is that you have to wait a month on each drug just to see it it is going to work. Those month can feel like years. Anyways, that is who I am. I hope to make a few friend here, and a lot of advice a well. Does anyone one else share these symptom if so, and if you think you can help contact me please Chronic fatigue, lack of motivation desire, inability to enjoy life, insomnia including the other obvious and supplementing symptom The real killer is I know I have the potential to be someone great, but I have to become happy first..Greg",0.35741

"Maybe They are Wrong About It All We are always told when you are depressed, your brain is lying to you about how bad everything is . What if they are wrong? If someone is piss poor and starving, cannot pay their bills, replace their moth-eaten clothes or go out to do interesting things, surely their money situation really IS a bad a all that. If someone ha no family, no friend and ha been bullied abused by everyone they have met in life, perhaps their social situation really IS a bad a all that. If someone ha had lot of physical health issue like cancer, chronic pain, obesity etc, maybe their physical woe really ARE a bad a all that. Some people go through all of the above, all at once. So maybe life IS a bad a all that for them. The whole your brain is lying about how bad thing are thing often just feel like you are just imagining your problem .

"Nice to see you too!! How are you today? I think you really have hit the mark on what I wa trying to express with this question - all the negativity and darkness that is contained in almost every medium outlet you can name. The disaster you mention, such real human tragedy but the way the medium went after it wa appalling and seemed to be muddled in politics and ratings. As for those forensic show - ugh! I used to be able to watch them but way before this recent episode of mine I stopped. I could not stand the heartache of knowing what evil lurks out there. Where I work now one of the first friend I made wa a gentleman who ha since retired. He told me that he did not read the news, watch TV or listen to the radio except for light jazz because he found that to do so wa just too much pain, it did not serve him to subject himself to that kind of pain. He seemed to be generally very happy and upbeat to me so there must be something to it. As for your friend - that is a tough one but maybe since she is your friend she might understand if you explain to her how incredibly painful her TV choice are on you. Does she ever read or post here? Anyway, it is GREAT talking with you again and I look forward to the next chat. I hope you have a wonderful day and weekend.",0.23209000000000002
"Get myself to be more active alive? So, my depression is getting worse and worse since a few years. I am in law school and I am in the last year of preparation - in our country, this is THE BUSIEST TIME ever for those student - like, they start studying at in the morning at stay until in the night at the library. nonstop studying for -, year in preparation for the big exams. I started last october. it is july. I have maybe studied on two or three days, seriously. the other time, I just sit at home, in a kind of weird freeze. I am BORED out of my mind, my brain is longing for some activity, and I actually really want to be all busy and studying and feel like I have a purpose. It is like I know exactly how important it is now, and my brain is screaming at me to get my book out and start doing what I want to do. But I just sit here. Heck, if I am procrastinating so bad, at least I could have fun, party, travel, meet people, see the world, at least not waste my time or waste it in a way that is at least fun! But I am still sitting here. Like in a shock. It feel like it is too late for the studying thing exam are in spring and I have no idea about the subject and skip all class I am paying for and I have no idea what else to do with my time. It doe not help that over the last two years, I kinda developed an eating disorder with anorexic, bulimic and binge-eating-tendencies that also made my health decline. I am constantly thinking about numbers, looking up nutritional infos, reading medical studies, looking at food online - it is taking so much space in my head although I am quite close to my goal , and I should not even worry because if I keep doing what I planned restrict for another - weeks, then slowly up my calorie until I no longer lose weight, stay at maintenance and start to slowly incorporate exercise to finally be healthy, eating healthy, and exercising to maintain good health , there is no reason to be so occupied with this topic. Any idea how to get myself to get up and DO SOMETHING? The sitting around is what is probably making me most depressed, because I watch my life burn down and kind of cannot do anything about. PLEASE do not suggest to get professional help. I know, it is the most rational thing, especially for the eating thing, but right now, I just cannot, I really cannot",0.32511
"When people ask you what you did for the weekend, or for your birthday, etc. I have no idea how to respond. My emotion have become so numb that I cannot feel anything so therefore I cannot enjoy anything I used to like doing. I literally just go to work everyday for hours, come home and browse the news and reddit and listen to music, trying to entertain myself but never really succeeding. There is nothing I can enjoy. So when someone asks me what I did I just say some crap like I just relaxed at home or something, I do not know what else to say. It is the worst part about depression for me. Not being able to enjoy anything. I do not even look forward to coming home from work because it is not like I have anything to enjoy at home. It is all the same dullness. I would probably work - hour a day seven day a week if I could because it would not bother me at all, I am not missing out on anything. Too bad they do not because they do not want to pay overtime for me of course.",0.19588000000000005

"Yep - I know this all too well. And it is a sad state of affairs. But you are aware of it. Best you know what is going on than be surprised. SN, I hear what you are saying about not being able to weather another strike against your stability now. And I hope you do not have to go. I will pray with you that you are spared from the cut this time, but while you are praying and hoping, consider the issue of your personal power. If you are feeling shaky in other area of life, I doubt that you feel that you have any. I have been in that situation over many things. Remember the difference between what you DO have control over and what you do NOT have control over you can control the way you approach this job, your punctuality, your diligence, your politeness to other worker you CANNOT control the decision made on the top and how they will affect your status. I have been reading a book called Corporate Confidential by Cynthia Shapiro. She wa an HR manager for her whole life and spill the bean on how company decide who will stay and who will go. It wa an eye-opener for me. Perhaps it can help you at this juncture. In your own prayers, remember to ask God not just for the optimal decision to be made on your behalf, but for the power to see where you do and do not have control and for help taking charge of the area that you actually can control. When you are in a phase of instability, it seems that more and more garbage get thrown your way. But a turning point come when the indignation of being tossed on everyone else is sea propels you into action. That turning point came for me about year ago when a really awful roommate had to be ejected. I felt a power I had never felt before - the ability to take charge of my own life, not waiting for someone else is decision to tell me whether I wa going to be OK or not. I am trying to find my way back to that point. I hope you do too. It can happen.",0.21236

"For those on antidepressants, is it working? Alternatives to antidepressants? Okay so I am going back to a psychiatrist next week for my depression. I have been going since high school and over the year have had depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, lack of motivation and interest, high anxiety, numbness, hopelessness, etc etc. recently it is been coming back. I have been on Zoloft which made me feel like a numb zombie and bupropion which I did not feel wa working. I have also tried Xanax made me calmer but high and a mood stabilizer that did not really help. I have since gotten off medication by my own choice but the problem are coming back. Generally I do not like rx drug and would rather do it naturally but it is not going away. My question to people is what antidepressant have worked, how long have u been using them, and ha ur depression improved? Should I take it for the long term? And what alternative method have worked for you guys?",0.33188

Not to say everything wa perfect back then, but every year it start feeling emptier and emptier. Even though my life ha technically better, I feel so empty and dead.

"I have posted a few time on these forum and everyone ha always been so helpful and supportive, so I am hoping I can get some help with this. For the last few weeks, my depression ha been so horrendous, worse than it is ever been, that I have not been able to go to work. I keep calling in sick, and then when I can finally make myself go, I hide in the bathroom cry or go to an empty office not in my cubicle and call my mother and cry to her. I have been in touch with my pdoc, who is in the process of passing me off to another doctor. Granted, it is at my request, a he is not on my insurance. However, he is not willing to put me on any other type of medication since he will not be seeing me regularly. I have spoken to my long - time pdoc from Dallas, my hometown, and he know me very well. I trust him more than any other doctor, which is not saying much, but he say that I am unipolar, aka major depressive disorder, and a mood stabilizer would be the next best thing to try since all the antidepressant are not working. wa taking mg celexa, just upped to mg when this all started. I am seeing a new pdoc that is covered by my insurance on Monday, so maybe thing will move forward. Ok, so back to the work thing. My supervisor is not sympathetic to my problem. In all fairness, I have not told her details. I find that most people do not consider mental disease a real medical problem. She suggested that I talk to Human Resources about taking some type of leave if I do not know when I will be better. I am working on that and hoping one of these doctor will sign for me. The biggest problem I have is the guilt over missing work. I never imagined that the depression could get so bad that I could not just suit up and show up. That is been my motto every time thing get rough. I guess I am looking for validation here. If I really do have it in my to get to work, I certainly cannot find it. I am a very responsible person, so this is not like me. The only time I have ever called in sick is when I wa having depression issues, but never more than one day. Everyone get a sick day, and I never get the flu or anything, so I do not feel guilty about those days. What do I do? Am I looking at this the wrong way? It is so hard to be objective when you are so low. My saving grace is that my parent who are far away in Dallas are being the most supportive people in the world. They believe me when I say I just cannot get to work, since that is not like me, but that is not like them either, so I know they want me to get there if I can.

"Hi, after post on the DF I am finally beginning to work out the format. Excuse the typo is a going through Prozac withdrawal and kind of shaky! I am year old, I live in the UK, Studied psychology, trained psychiatric nurse, behavior family therapist, and trainee CB therapist. Not sure if I can go back to my CBT course a I have missed so much time from university due to my current episode. This is my worst episode ever. I have had depression for years, and have been ashamed and embarrassed by it. As my life seems to be ebbing away, I have come out with it and seeking psychiatric help. My problem ha been that I work in psychiatry and have feared loosing my job career. It mean everything to me. It is the only thing I have and could not bare seeing it go down the toilet. Friends do not understand and know how to discus the topic with me. My family doe not know a it would devastate an already broken family. For year I have suffered in silence, cried silent screams, been tormented by my own brain. I hate imagining living a life like this especially when the long term effect I am reminded of every day my patient . The only person I had wa my ex girlfriend, we split last year. CAUSE? me. Stress got the better of me, my thinking became screwed and I have lost her, for life. She wa the only one I could talk to, some one I had known for, odd years. Depression ha ruined my life. This episode ha been an eye opener. This is the first time planet earth is hearing about my struggle. Something, which may have otherwise been lost. My secret buried with me. Do not confuse this a a suicide note. It is not. It is me talking about thing in this way for the first time. I am over the crisis point but nowhere near my usual self and need to sort my medicine out with my doctor a soon a possible. I have had a brave chat with my bos who is going to sort out a psychiatrist in the next days, all being well. I have only taken one OD in with a serious intent to kill myself. Doctors said I survived a I woke up. For year I have avoided talking about it, never wanted to see a psychiatrist but realize now well for now that there is people inside me. One is me, the other is depression and to stand the best chance of staying well and keeping well then I need to face I have a problem. Around week ago I wa so actively suicidal, I wa thinking of jumping off a bridge into the river, i searched the internet for way to kill myself. I am out of that acute phase but do not trust myself. I have tried SSRIs but they just do not agree with me so it look like I am going back on Mirtazapine. I stopped taking it sometime ago a I put on weight. Since last year I have lost stone through diet and exercise. In the last week I have lost lb a a result of depression. Right now my mind is blank. I have never chatted to anyone on this forum before but I know you guy know what I am going through. My life ha never been the same since . It never will be. My dad died in since then thing have worsened. I have so much to say I could write on but going to leave it for now. You guy are the first to hear my full well pretty full story. I have never had the courage to speak like this before. Bye for now",0.0
"year I have been managing depression and I wa doing well, until last Monday. Quick back story m Ireland. I wa a competitive Powerlifter and represented my country on occasion with great success. My life wa lifting setting goals, reaching targets, smashing PBs..all helped with creating a future for myself. I started to feel unwell around December and developed a persistent, non-productive cough. Series of test led me to an echocardiograph where it wa discovered I wa suffering Heart Failure. Dilated Cardio Myopathy caused by a viral infection, left my heart function at EF. Apparently I had a few month to live if I had not caught it. Ironically, now, I wish they had not discovered it. My world flipped upside down. No Powerlifting, no excessive exercise, restricted fluid intake, no over exertion, med for the rest of my life, regular review in my heart clinic, multiple ambulance emergency ride to A amp E when my heart go irregular. Hospital, pharmacy, hospital, pharmacy.. Seems to be my life for the past year. Last Monday I snapped. It hit me. Everything I lost came crashing in on me. I got in my car, picked a place I knew well to ram my car into at mph. I wa screaming at myself to do it. My left hand steering towards the end, my right hand steering me to survive. An image of my dog in my mind kept me on the road. I knew she would miss me too much. I am still very low now despite all my meds. I still wish I had gone through with it. I still think of going to the Cliffs of Moher and jumping.. What a beautiful place to end it. I am dreading the road ahead because I know how Rocky it is going to be.. Help me please.",0.0

"I just told all student I teach I have depression in an email about final week I am an undergraduate TA at a university, in an interdisciplinary class about the brain. I absolutely love being a TA, but admittedly this quarter it ha been a struggle mentally, I often feel anxious that I am doing a horrible job. I sent out this email to all of my student about final Hi everyone, These next two week will be a really, really tough time for all of you. I know how incredibly hard you all have worked this quarter, and how hard you will push yourselves during this final stretch, but there are other thing I want you to know I, the other TAs, and our professor will not be disappointed if you do not perform a well you want, so you should not be either. Tests and grade are not always the best reflection of you a student scientists, and they are most certainly are not a reflection of your worth a a person. All a test ass is how much content you remember and how well you can take a test at a certain time on a certain day. It is simply one data point, and a you should all know by now, data point is not representative of the population. For many of you, you have other final presentation responsibility going on, and it will be difficult to find time to study. For others, you may want so badly to study a lot, but cannot because you are so stressed and anxious. I personally deal with anxiety and depression, and I know how utterly frustrating it is when your mind doe not work a well a you want it to. Take care of yourself. Eat good food, get some sleep, spend time with people you love. So, while you prepare for final these next weeks, keep these two thing in mind. You are all incredibly curious, kind, intelligent and important people. I brag all the time that I get to work with the most amazing group of student who bring unique and valuable contribution to this class everyday, and inspire me to be the best TA I can possibly be. Cheering you on!! austen I cannot believe I just told all my student about my mental illness, but it honestly feel so liberating to do so. It also feel so hypocritical of me to send this, because I attribute much of my self-worth to academic and do not practice much self-care..but I felt like this needed to be said .",0.21785

When you feel comfortable enough, feel free to share any of your thoughts, questions, concerns, experiences, etc..Congrats on taking your first step towards recovery! I think it take a lot of courage to start treatment. I know it took me quite a while to admit to myself I could not handle my situation on my own any longer. I think you did great starting on both talk therapy and medicines! I hope you find therapy useful and that you and your therapist can work towards better skill to cope with the stressor in your life. Concerning your medication. There is a room dedicated to your antidepressant Prozac. You will find lot of information there. Check it out sometime. One of the downside of antidepressant is the fact that it take a while for them to kick in. You only started about day ago so you will have to give the Prozac some time to be able to fully benefit from it. Meanwhile I hope you are not having too many side effects! Tom, thanks for joining.

Usually I am pretty good at bouncing back but this job just broke something inside me. I am a damn failure. Three attempt at college. Flunked out after the first year. That is ok, college is not for everyone. Try a bunch of min wage jobs. Get fired or quit with in the first month or two. I cannot do damn thing. I have no motivation to do anything at all anymore. I used to clock around - hour a day gaming because it wa something I genuinely enjoyed. I have gotten minute in an entire damn week. I literally just cannot muster the strength to want to do it. I have been pulling away from people because it is just exhausting to talk to them. I literally just get tired after five minute of conversation. It is insane. We will barely be through the how is your day been going before I already want to go somewhere else because it is so draining. I have hit a complete rock wall in therapy. I tell my therapist nearly all of this shit and she help me a best she can but there is only so much she is able to do. She ha no magic way of instilling me with motivation. Like.. to put it into perspective. I stared at a wall for hour today. Because I just wa to tired to anything else. hours! I wa not thinking about anything. I wa not being bored. I just do not have motivation to do anything! But what is worse is the moment I start thinking again is the moment all the sadness wash over me. It is like I am in the middle of a vast, dark ocean and cannot find shore. I swim and I swim and I swim but salvation is just nowhere to be seen. And I am beginning to grow tired. I have no future ahead of me. Nothing to look forward too. I go through thousand of career test and application and all I see is that I am either not interested enough or not good enough for any career. And I cannot simply work for money. Money in and of itself just is not good enough for me to work at a job I hate or am completely uninterested in. That is the strain of these minimum wage jobs, some of them I have had to quit because they have literally made me suicidal. I am so lost right now.

"I joined yesterday and have been reading through some of the posts. Thought I had better introduce my self. I live in the UK. Looking back on my life I think I have always had depression. It got worse though, . year ago after the birth of my son. I though i had PND at the time. I wa always crying, felt really low and would panic if I wa left alone with the baby. It put a huge strain on my marriage and lot of argument because my husband though I had gone off him. I went back to work put could not cope, lack of motivation etc. but like someone said below I put on a happy face to make people think that I wa OK. I muddled through for a year then went to see a GP who put me on Prozac. Stupid me came off it after month thinking I wa OK. Slowly the depression came back, I wa not coping with my job, the simplest task at work and at home were impossible to face, I could not concentrate or make decisions. Last Spring it all got too much. I wa getting up cry every morning, I became agoraphobic. I phoned in work and said i could not go in. I saw the GP and went on Prozac. I took month off work. I stayed on Prozac until last September. And then, guess what, it all came back with a vengeance a few month ago. This time I wa also feeling suicidal which really scared me. So I am now back on the Prozac and determined to stay on it. I think I have generalized depression made worse by circumstances. The birth of my son, trying to keep a job down and be a Mom, and my husband. Last year my husband really turned to alcohol and ended up ill in hospital. He ha been on incapacity benefit ever since, so our relationship and our finance have really suffered. He ha changed to. Even though he say he love me he get angry a lot, shout at me, criticizes me, put me down. I do not know how much more of it I can take, without leaving him.

"Rolling down hill Hi all, It all started last year when I quit my bachelor in Physical Therapy. That study didnt seem right for me and I dropped out in feb . From februari till september I have worked a depressing job in an order picking centre to pay for my next year of college. But after that there wasnt any motivation for anything left over in me. This year I started a new study, lifesciences. It started all fun for the first two months. Because we had the basic of chemistry, anatomy, algebra and physics. But in the beginning of november the second semester started and thus I had test from the first semester. Failed them all. In the week leading to the test I couldnt concentrate or motivate myself to do anything. I wa just at my room doing absolutely nothing. november wa my birthday, turned . Everyone forgot it except my gf for , year . Was a fun day and made me forget the test result and gave me a little hope. Today she told me she wa seeing someone else for the last month because I had too little time to see her, because I wa always busy with school. Im feeling that everything is worse. My job suck but I have to keep it a I got to keep up with school costs. Already got pretty hefty debt from those two halve year of university. I just feel that everything that I do fails. Like the last year I have accomplished nothing. I would like to travel if I am going to have my second gap year but my fund wouldnt allow it. Working would be my only option but the only job that are available will push me over the edge. But there is something good at the horizon there is a small chance I am getting accepted in to the police academy, but that is only a small chance so no big hope a that make it worse.",0.23391

"I am overwhelmed by guilt over my boyfriend is sexual assault of my once-best friend. My boyfriend of year and I both suffer from mental health issue and trauma. I found out somewhat recently that month ago, when my then-best friend wa sleeping over we were both asleep in the bed and he touched her sexually. Apparently he wa stoned and thought he might start a threesome it wa casually mentioned a a possibility earlier . I know what he did wa horrible.

On the other hand, he himself is absolutely sick with guilt. He is been having non-stop anxiety attacks, cry spells, and moment of catatonia and he cannot stop saying how horrible it wa that he did that and how he want to be a good person. I believe he is genuine and my first reaction is to make sure he get treatment so nothing close to that ever happens again. He checked himself into a psychiatric ward last night. I am also so overwhelmed by guilt by how selfish my internal response ha been. He ha cheated on me before multiple times, and I cannot help but ruminate on how if I were prettier this would not have happened and how it effect me. One recent smaller time just happened and I have had to take care of his emotion while being angry about this main terrible incident and that one. Furthermore, I am selfishly worried about how badly this is affecting me.

"The world need more lollipop moment . Back in middle school, I wa helping out at a sunday school, tutoring primary kids. There wa this adorable little girl who wa struggling to sing the right tune of a hymn. Even though I have absolutely no musical background, I tried to help her get her vocal and lyric right by singing the hymn together. Eventually, I told her to continue repeating it herself and that every practice is an improvement from the last. She would call me frequently just to sing her new hymn and I would challenge her to learn a new hymn every week, this routine went on for quite a while between ourselves.. Fast forward to today, I am currently a struggling undergrad student coping with depression and stress and well a deteriorating health due to extreme fatigue. Bad grade and crippling financial debt are the least of my concerns. Many day I would feel tired and unmotivated to do anything.. and barely making it to lecture only to zone off. At day I would think of suicide a well. There wa nobody I could turn to that I felt I could relate to or even understand me.. It wa not until a few day ago I received an email from the girl is mother, the girl wa unfortunately diagnosed with an illness that made her lose up to of her hearing. However, she wa recently accepted to a prestigious musical academy, and sent me the audition tape of her performance thanking me for my encouragement. That song that she performed, wa the very first hymn she struggled when I first came up to her. Knowing that the girl went through so much hardship just to chase the dream I stimulated her from her youth gave me so much hope at the darkest point of my life. Knowing that I had the capacity to influence a big change in a little girl life gave me the purpose to live. Even though I had to wait for year for this news, it wa worth it.

I have been prescribed Citalopram Celexa for those stateside but like I said - I have deep-seated reservation about taking them and before I tried, I wanted to see if there wa anywhere anyone I could talk to about their experience on the drug and any perhaps any suggestion they could offer about managing short-term - month antidepressant medication?

"Martin Luther King Jr. And depression As my suffering mounted I soon realized that there were two way in which I could respond to my situation -- either to react with bitterness or seek to transform the suffering into a creative force. I decided to follow the latter course - King JR. Today got me thinking..We need to figure out how we can turn our discontent, anxiety, anhedonia, insecurity, self hatred, and the meaninglessness that we all feel into real world change that we can see, touch , and feel proud of in a tangible form. We need to figure out a a community, how we can re-direct our negative feeling into helping others, and maby in the process we will be helping ourselves. I think alot of u feel meaningless, and have a hard time creating motivation to get u out of bed, besides our rare and far between moment of clarity. If we could find a way to re-direct our negative energy and encourage eachother to work towards cause we believe in, we could change the world while at the same time changing ourselves.At this point in my life, I have a good job and financial security, but I still experience horrible depression and that underlying feeling that im a failure and living a meaninglessness existence . I have come to find that the only time I really feel alive , or any feeling remotely resembling happiness is when I am either on drugs, or when I am helping people and making a difference. The latter of those two ha actually improved my life, and I am hoping that a a depression community, we can motivate eachother to help re-direct our sadness to further cause that are meaningful to us, and hopefully squash our cynicism.

"year old and already miserable i just need to vent about how lost i feel in life. i have no dream or ambition about what i want to do a a career in my life, i have a job now which i suck at even though i basically only help my bos a few time out of the day and i only get about one shift every two weeks. i suck at driving even though it been a couple of month of constant driving practice trying to get my license. i have had girl interested me in the past but not for a long time even though i always manage to fuck it up anyway because im so socially awkward and i honestly feel like im going to be alone for life because i cant make a connection with any girl on earth.

"F I really need someone to listen This is a throw-away, because I do not want anyone in my personal life to see this. Let me preface this by saying I have been diagnosed with bipolar tendency i guess you cannot diagnose bipolar disorder until you are , severe depression, chronic anxiety and body dysmorphia. I have been hospitalized for a suicide attempt almost two year ago, and I have struggled with self harm since fourth grade. I wa bullied relentlessly throughout elementary and middle school. Thankfully, i have been clean for a year, and after the hospital I got on medication and thing started to get better for a while. My senior year ha been great so far but it is starting to get bad again. I used to be a social smoker, but now I am completely dependent on marijuana for everything. I am not hungry unless I smoke and I cannot fall asleep unless I smoke. I need it to get through the day. I cannot go to college, because I cannot afford it and my mom say she cannot consign on a loan for me. I totally understand that too, because if my dad were to die she would be in trouble and in ten of thousand of dollar in debt. I am just sad because I want to go away like all of my friend but I cannot. My dad is most likely going to lose his job soon apparently too, which is going to put u in poverty. My mom and dad fight all the time, and hate each other. They have both talked about getting a divorce to me exclusively. I pretend like it doe not bother me, but it does. My dad is addicted to prescription painkillers, and lock himself in his room the minute he get home. He come to my choir concerts, plays, and musical but leaf almost immediately after it starts, which hurt me a lot. I pretend like I do not care about that either. The thing that hurt me the most now is my dog wa put down today. She wa my first dog. I wa allergic to dog when I wa way younger. I grew out of it and it took so long to find her, because my mom wa set on picking the perfect dog for us. We found her, and now she is gone. I wa the one who stayed in the room with her, because my mom could not do it. I pet and comforted her while she died. I have never had to cope with someone dying before, and it is so hard. She wa just a dog, but I still loved her so much. I want her back so bad. My problem are so minor compared to some people is, but I am so sad right now. I do not know what to do. This is the first time in a while that I have wanted to kill myself, but I do not want to go down that road again. I just do not know how to cope anymore.",0.3856000000000001
"My Boyfriend Talks Daily About Suicide -- Wo not Go To Hospital Hi guys, I am really just at a loss for what to do. I am absolutely gutted. My boyfriend ha pretty serious depression and is in dire need of help. I will not be able to get him in to see a therapist until next week. He ha recently become quite down on his luck and he hate himself for it. His anxiety stopped him from going to work, and he wa fired. He ha a new job now, but he hate it a it is a factory job where he work hr week. Any time I try to help him find a new job so he can leave this job, he completely panic and shuts down and I cannot say anything or else he yells. It ha gotten so bad recently that I dread waking up in the morning because of the psychological warfare with him. He will do thing like saying he want to self-harm, or he is going to jump out of the car while I am driving. I have been with him for years, through thick and thin. I have had to bring him to the hospital before, and he did get better for a few months. He told me tonight he doe not want me to pick him up from work, and that he wa not going to come home. At this point I feel completely lost, and I know calling the police will not help. I feel trapped and I need to get out for my own health, but I am deathly terrified he is going to kill himself if I leave. He told me I am the only thing holding him back from killing himself. I am scared. He is such a good person when he is not feeling this constant depression. I do not know how to get him to understand we just want to help him. He shuts me down every single day, and it hurt knowing he ha given up on himself. What can I do to help him until he can see his therapist next week?

"Finally got a job, but do not really care. So, finally after about - months, I got a job. The job is not a bad one. Quite the opposite, actually. They specifically hired me saying that they were not looking for someone to just stick for a year and move on they wanted to hire someone and essentially keep them train them eventually up to management level in the course of hopefully a year or two depending how well I take it. I said yes.. though, mostly out of seizing a good opportunity. I am not happy, or excited. I just do not care, really. amp nbsp First and foremost, I am a minimalist. The urgency of I need to save and buy a house , or I need a secure career future , etc.. is non-existent in my life. Everything I own could fit in a van, and there would still be space left. I am not exaggerating. I have even contemplated living in one build some insulation to the walls, lay out some flooring, and call it home. I would be absolutely comfortable. Anyway My point is I actually have no reason to be taking this opportunity. The only thing that really ran through my head wa I will probably kick myself in the as in the future for not taking this . Considering this is a job that will eventually lead to a solid annual salary within essentially no time, and requires no degree or fancy stuff, it wa kinda hard to say no. But it wa also kinda hard to say yes. I do not have an endgame. I do not have a goal. At best, the closest thing to a goal that came to mind wa Eh, I would probably get back into riding, and buy myself a motorcycle or something . That wa it. My mind literally blank after that. Nothing else is there. amp nbsp I am not suicidal. I do not go to sleep hoping that I will never wake up again though I would not be upset by it , and I do not wake up upset that I am alive for another day in life. If I had to describe how I feel right now.. Everything is in a very, very quiet limbo. It is a very passive depression. amp nbsp The best way I can summarize it is that this world ha so much noise , and it is exhausting for me. I get exhausted just from thinking about it. I wish people could just relax, and stop stirring so much motion around. It is always been like this for my entire life. I am so tired. Everything everyone ha to move around with such haste, but all I want to do is stop. I just want to appreciate the colors. I want to laugh. I want to be happy.

"Just venting Not sure the general gist of where this post is going but I just kind of want to write down my thoughts. I tend to feel better after I do so. Maybe along with that I can have the added bonus of affecting somebody else in a positive way with what I say or that someone else understands what I am saying. I am alone a I type this. I am sure many people who frequent this sub would describe themselves in that way. I feel over the year I have been getting more and more depressed. I wa depressed when in my teen then I hit a lull in my s where I just did not care about much and put thing out of mind. Now, I seem to be at a combination of both. A kind of dead, feel nothing type of feeling mixed in with depression. I have been getting angrier a well. Bitter and resentful. I feel like when I wa a teen I just thought strongly that I wa not very great in the general sense. I feel like I now know that to be true. After enough life experience and enough time with yourself you start to see who and what you are. Needless to say I do not like who I am. Maybe you do not either. I am not a strong, wise, caring, compassionate, friendly, hard-working, courageous, generous, et fuckin cetera that I would like. Well, why do not you change? Cause I clearly do not fuckin want to. Maybe I enjoy being depressed? Because obviously I have laid out terms, so to speak, for me to be depressed. Not courageous, hard enough working, kind etc etc. Yet, I do not do shit about it. So why complain a if I am depressed because of it? I think that is where the day to day numb feeling come in. It is like I am this way. I do not like being this way. I do not change being this way. Why tf are you even upset? I really do not feel I deserve what I have in my life. Like the organ donor program I feel I would want to give my body to someone else. Maybe they can make better use of my fully functional legs. My vision. Ever see those people do an absolute fuck ton of thing with their life? Those people who are so driven to accomplish a b c d e f g.. Every day of their life and they only have limb? Are blind? Live in abject poverty? I have NONE of these fucking hurdles. I, in fact, do not have anything anyone would legitimately call a hurdle in life and yet I feel depressed. It is probably justified that I feel this way. I do not do anything to try and feel better and I do not capitalize on advantage I have in my life to make thing better. To grow a a person. I do not do that for myself let alone for other people. And yet I want to have success.. I want to have profound love. Meaning and purpose. What a joke Just wish I could hit the fast forward button on this shit and get through with it. Oh right.. There is suicide. But even that hold it is own unique stigma to it. Next to no one would recommend you do that. It is not an ideal solution. So on and so forth. But you kind of have to admit that those that do go through with it.. It is a if you cannot question them. You cannot question their pain. Ca not question their sense of guilt or anguish or depression and sadness. They solidified it and made it real moreso than practically anyone could ever do when alive. Sometimes I wonder if those that commit suicide do so because it is either a the only perceived way out of their grief or b that it effectively prof to others beyond a shadow of a doubt what kind of hell they had been living through in the year leading up to doing it. You can never question someone who killed themselves a to whether their pain wa real. Not just in the sense that they are no longer around to ask but that no one would ask what everyone inherently knows. Of course they felt pain. I feel that might be suicide greatest allure. It effectively put a stamp on your sadness a legitimate. I have thought about it a lot throughout my life. I do not think I would ever have the stone to do it. Maybe my life or state of mind just is not that bad. Not yet anyways. Kind of a long read Hi to all those that like reading long post from internet randoms 👋",0.37548
"Whatever happened to Doctor - patient confidentiality?? I applied for short term disability because depression is affecting my job and I am barely function - able at work. The insurance company made me sign a waiver of privacy to both my therapist and psychiatrist. Now they can call them up and ask anything they want!! The insurance company called me yesterday for a telephone interview ! They wanted me to explain why I needed the time off, what my symptom are, how long have I been like this, really personal question .. They are going to be the one who determine whether I can get disability pay or not! Whatever happened to just taking the word of the doctor?? I wonder who the insurance company can tell? I forgot to ask them if this is going to be kept confidential. They also asked how this is affecting my job, I felt if I gave the wrong answer, they will decide not to pay me. I wonder what they are going to ask my shrinks, and how much info the shrink can give them. Also, I understand that the shrink therapist can break the confidentiality rule if you threaten to hurt yourself or another -- that I can understand, but if you are ever on trial for something they can subpoena the doctor and they have to tell ALL! That is ridiculous! What happens if I am just a witness to some crime, but did not do the crime. What happens if the lawyer want to discredit me so they put my shrink on the stand to ask what a nut I am? Just ranting, but opinions, feedback would be appreciated.",0.30304000000000003
"I am year old female. I have been on numerous antidepressant and anxiety medicine since I wa year old. I never had a problem with sexual dysfunction because I had never been in a serious relationship, I had never been sexual with someone. Now that I am in a sexual, serious relationship, I am having problems. I believe this is a result of Lexapro. I have never had a problem orgasming at least not to this extent and I have been on Zoloft, Prozac, you name it, etc. These medicine were changed because they were either making me too drowsy or simply were not working . During the summer, I wa only on Wellbutrin and had no problem orgasming. However, due to overwhelming anxiety during the start of the school year, I started taking Lexparo and continued the Wellbutrin. Ever since I added Lexapro, I have had an EXTREMELY delayed orgasm, or no orgasm at all. It is really frustrating. My doctor suggested switching medicine, but since Lexapro is working so well for me a far a anxiety goes, I said I would rather not. I cannot lower my dose because I am on the starting dose for both Wellbutrin and Lexapro. He said I could switch to Effexor or another SSRI medicine, but I may have the same sexual dysfunction. I wa just wondering if anyone here ha had a successful combination of Wellbutrin plus an anxiety medication that did not cause such extreme sexual dysfunction.",0.34773000000000004

"Intrusive Thoughts I feel like I am standing on a grassy hill and the blade of grass is blowing in the wind around me, the sky is turning darker and darker.

"My Story - There is hope. TRIGGER WARNING - includes graphic language. Hi there, first time posting. I see a lot of post from high school college aged people, and being through that myself, all I want to do is reach out and hug them and tell them how special they are. Instead of writing all the typical stuff you are so young, you will grow out of it, go see a therapist take medication, etc., I thought I would share how depression affected me mentally amp emotionally and my journey through college. I got to the point where depression wa life threatening, and I had given up all hope. I wa lucky because my mom and my dad were committed to my recovery, even if it meant I deeply hated and resented them at the time. I realize not everyone ha that, but in sharing my story, I hope that maybe certain aspect can resonate with people going through the same thing I did and help them not feel so alone. How Depression Affected Me - trigger warning It find a way to connect to memories. To healthy feelings. And twist them into something dark. It craves uncertainty and pain and tell you that you deserve only that. It make you seek out the deepest crevice of your mind and get lost. To the point where you do not even know what is you and what is the sickness anymore. It almost feel good to indulge because it is so familiar. We are taught that enduring pain is somehow one of the most beautiful thing a person can do. But what if that pain is not real? In college, I wa so afraid of being alone that I would not want guy to leave my room. And there were a fair amount of them. I would beg them to stay longer and tell them I had separation anxiety. As long a I wa focusing on them, I did not have to focus on me. I justified it by saying that I wa enjoying my college experience and exploring my sexuality. I thought it wa normal to not see color, to not ever be excited, to want to drink until my body wa a numb a my mind. I wondered how other people could live life with relative stability and thought I wa weak for not knowing what they knew. To me, it seemed like common knowledge that life wa pointless and ultimately a waste of time. I did not understand why I wa the only one that could not cope with that fact. When I wa home over a break, I told my mom that I had accepted I would never be happy. When my mom said she wa hurt by that, it did not even occur to me why. I thought I had learned the secret that everyone else knew, the secret that let them go to class or work or see friend or make friends. Even though by the end of my freshman year, I wa cutting myself and promiscuous and drank with the purpose of blacking out so I could have even just an hour of relief from myself, I could not admit that I had depression. I thought I felt and acted like that because I wa lazy, stupid, slutty, weak. Every semester, my grade slipped a little or a lot at a time, and my parent grew more and more disappointed in me. I had been a star student in elementary school, frequently getting the highest score in class and got into every top middle amp high school. I felt like such a failure. At this point, my parent sent me to a very expensive therapist, which ultimately wa a waste of money because all I did wa bend the truth to hide every aspect of myself and life. I do not think I could have even been honest even if I wanted to at this point. The first semester of my junior year, these thought grew too heavy. I did not want to be there anymore. I wanted to be nowhere, not awake, not asleep, not alive, not dead. I spent my time with people that encouraged all my doubts, and I pushed away people that cared. I rarely went to class and even if I did, I scraped by on the assignments. I lived for the moment of escape when I could go to party and drink and hook up with guys, no matter how repelled I wa by them. Outside of those few hour of escape, I could not sleep. I never went to the cafeteria with friend or even to get a real meal. I only ate Lean Cuisines that my parent had bought me at the beginning of the year. When I ran out, I ate solely Pizza Rolls and peanut M amp Ms. I did not do laundry once in those few month and barely took showers. The only time I put any effort into my personal appearance wa when I went to a party because all I wanted wa to be perceived a carefree and sexy, not the lazy slob that I thought I was. Even then, I wore wildly inappropriate clothing compared to what everyone else at my college wore - one time a girl yelled out to me, You are going to get raped! Another said judgmentally to a friend, She is not wearing pants. I wa wearing sequined booty shorts, okay . My only happy moment that semester were with a boy that then tried to sexually assault me with a visiting alumnus. His excuse wa that he wanted to get into the alumnus frat by impressing that brother. When he tried to apologize the next morning, I told him he should not apologize. I wa so disconnected from my body, I did not even view it a mine anymore. After that, I did not blame him and still spent most of my free time with him. Free meaning when I wa not laying on my bed trying to gather enough strength to even leave my room, going to a party or the rare occasion I went to class or very very rarely attended a sorority event. My last night at that school, my theory that I had borderline personality disorder wa weighing on me. I had been thinking about it for a couple of week after I had finally figured out that my behavior and thought were not the typical college experience, thanks to my extremely honest roommate amp sorority sister. She told me that other girl in the sorority thought I wa trying to fuck with their guy friend and slept with too many people. I tried to go to the student health center earlier that day. When I stated, I think I have borderline personality disorder, they just said, What do you want u to do? The only action they were equipped to take wa to call the on-duty counselor who had to drive minute to get to campus. When I told her about my self harm and drinking and promiscuity she replied, How doe that make you different than any other student? This further cemented my past notion that I wa just weak the numbness and loneliness - the desire to feel anything at all - wa normal, and I just had a huge character flaw by not having the strength to be normal. That night I got wasted and tried to swallow a whole bottle of caffeine pill at my friend is house. My intention wa to induce a heart attack. He wa one of the only people that I knew understood what I wa feeling, but I never got a chance to tell him how close to the edge I wa since his freshman girlfriend and two of her friend were with him that night. Not that it wa his responsibility, but I just wanted confirmation that something wa not right with me. While I wa at his house, I tried to stay true to my carefree, fun person that I tried so hard portray while his girlfriend and her friend complimented my shirt and hair. It made me feel like such a fraud. Towards the end of the night, after I had swallowed those pills, my friend tried to get me to throw them up and then drove me to my dorm where I could not even find my room. I stumbled around and ran into the RA that had just gotten out of the shower and clung to him. I wa scared and confused and felt so alone. I eventually got to my room and started cutting my already scarred wrist with baby scissors. I tried to cut into my femoral artery with those scissors a well, which wa entirely unsuccessful. I settled for cutting my knee. At that moment, campus safety knocked on the door. I kept calm when they asked their usual questions, Have you been drinking tonight?, etc., until they asked me to show them my wrists. That is when I panicked. Started screaming and cry uncontrollably. They escorted me to their office. I later learned one of the officer asked my roommate if I slept around. While I wa incoherently yelling, an officer handed me a phone. It wa my mom, and I cried that a death of a young man I knew in high school wa my fault, and that I could have done something. Background His death wa not my fault in any conceivable way. He OD ed. I barely knew him amp did not even know he wa an addict, but I had a huge crush on him at the time and never acted on it. Through my warped logic, if I had been braver and talked to him, I could have isaved him. The next day she wa at my school ready to pick me up. She had flown on the next available flight to get to me. When I returned home, I went through month of therapy and psychiatry and yoga and meditation all arranged all by my mom. In the beginning, I wa okay. Broken down and exhausted but seemingly on the mend. On some level, I wa relieved that I had finally been diagnosed with something went from depression to bipolar II to a depressive mood disorder . I worked really hard with my therapist to understand my guilt, disgust and trauma, which ironically had been entirely driven by way I tried to cope with my depression. However, fully expecting to go back to college for the next semester, I wa informed that I wa not allowed to return yet. When I chose to leave in the middle of the semester, the dean did not share the information that they had never let a student return from health leave until after six month of treatment. I had withdrawn from all my class and sacrificed a semester is worth of my parent money thinking that I would be returning shortly and only a semester behind. After that initial blow, my parent eventually gave me more freedom, I met and got involved with a guy that got me more into substances. He wa going through issue of his own, which is why I connected with him. One morning, my parent tried to wake me up but could not. No need to go into further detail, but it wa one step forward and two step back I no longer wanted to be nowhere but wa now using.. alcohol.. frequently . Despite alcohol being one of my main coping mechanisms, I wa fortunate not to develop any dependency or addictions. A handful of month later, after my parent had taken away my phone and forced me to be supervised by them every night, I wa accepted into a local university. I had also found a new therapist and psychiatrist. Their word stuck to me Depression suck and it most likely will be with you forever but there are way of treating it. and You get to a point in your recovery where you cannot blame your depression anymore. You just have to stand up and do your homework go to your job go to class. I wa also lucky enough to have a couple professor that understood on a basic level what I wa going through. One told me to show up to class no matter how miserable I was. I did not bother to explain that depression wa not about being miserable, but from there on out I did everything within my emotional power to go to class, even if I had drank before that happened a couple time or did not participate happened almost every time . I ended up getting a C or D in the class, but I take that a a win since I easily could have failed. Another professor asked student service to reach out to me after I had not shown up to class a couple week in a row. I learned there will be a lot of people that do not get it and do not want to get it, but the one or two that do make all the difference in the world. Throughout my time at the new university, there were a lot of ups meeting a close friend and actually making personal connection with people, excelling at the course in my major and down failing multiple class and having to proactively withdraw due to ispecial circumstances, finishing an entire bottle of wine in an hour, cry and writing gibberish about how guilty I felt then inviting some random year old I had met on Tinder over to my dorm room , but slowly I wa piecing it together. I eventually got an on-campus job, then a full time internship then a full-time job. While I am not perfect these days, I have been at a job I never would have dreamed of for the past two and half year and have gotten a promotion. Still, sometimes when the depression get the best of me, I think that is who I really am. This broken, beaten down person that is ashamed of basically her entire young adulthood. I fear that I do not want anything of substance. That I cannot find anything of substance. That I do not even know what I want. No path. No passion. When it get that bad, it take every ounce of strength I have to fight it. Even on good days, I can feel like it is in the back my mind. I am terrified that it will come back, and I will not be able to control it. I will give in to the thought that say I am not good enough. You will never be good enough. Everything you have dared to want will slip through your fingers, and you will not even know. All I do is think about how far I have come from that girl who swallowed a dozen caffeine pills. That girl who thought she would never be happy. And it give me just enough strength to deny those feeling and smile. I hope this wa not too personal, but I wanted to be a raw and honest a possible.

I will keep it short, but I found out my parent were getting divorced when I came home from college on spring break. I do not have a lot of friend and no close friend to confide in. The only people I do talk to are leaving for college soon I am staying home now and the only thing I had left wa my girlfriend who cheated on me.

"I wanted to kill myself tonight. I am not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I have had a very rough few week with finding myself jobless, financially struggling and fighting with my boyfriend that I decided to write this little note in my phone. The ending is supposed to sound funny, it wa the only thing that made me laugh and give me that final push thought of pulling myself out of this horrible hole I wa in tonight Tonight, under a drunken wine induced depression, followed by the realization that someone I trust had betrayed it and lack of anti depressants, i seriously considered slitting my wrist in the bathroom. While sobbing with my hand in my face, trying to figure out who would take care of my son and my unpaid debt, I looked up to see my cat staring at me. She ha this stern, mothering expression in her eyes, and we locked eye for the longest time. She kept my gaze until my sobbing wa under control and I really thought about my actions. Maybe she just wanted wet food. I am really bad at remembering to take my meds, and usually the day or two where I forget doe not have this effect on me, but for the pile of emotional shit dealt to me the last week or so, apparently it did. I have not felt suicidal in year and I just need someone to understand where I am coming from.",0.33887

Why is this the only way and the only time i can ever share my feeling? Why am i depressed? Do you want to know? .. because i got raped and abused for years. because i had my childhood taken away from me by a person that i trusted my life with, by the person that i called my father. My step dad raped me for years, since i wa year old until a few month ago. Why did not i tell anyone? why could not i speak up? .. because he told me they would not believe me, it would ruin the family. my mom would hate me. well he wa right about one thing it did ruin the family, but they did believe me and my mom still love me. it ruined the family for a better cause. i do not ever have to see or talk to my step dad ever again. so why do i still feel this way?. .. because my mom still love him, she is torn between u and she never really took my side and helped me through this. For year of my life i had to pretend to be happy and normal. i had to push everything in the back off my mind and cry every night. i had to wonder why he wa doing this to me, i thought he loved me. He had been my father since i wa . how could he betray me like this and hurt me. how could he take away my childhood. from that i learned that in the end everything will be bad and nothing is ever what it seems. I had to grow up so fast, i had to realize how the world really was. i had to lie and keep secrets. I learned to hide everything even myself, even my soul. It took me year of pain and suffering. of growing, thinking and knowing. of wishing, hoping and dreaming. to finally speak up. To finally show myself. to make my soul vulnerable. To cry a million tear that i could never cry before. but now that i can be me and show myself, i do not like myself. All the pain and misery. the secret and lies. the memory and nightmares. this all wa building up inside of me for years. Now it showing and I am a bitter and sad person. I wa on the verge of exploding and now it taking me along time to get all this build up out of me. I have never really discovered who i really am. I pretended for year and now all the hurt and bitterness is showing. When and if that is all gone what will i really be like? i cannot even picture myself being happy or excited. I cannot picture my self in color when everything around me including me is gray and bleak. Will anyone ever love me? I try to love people but they always hurt me and i know that it will always be that way ..",0.32903000000000004

"I do not know how I am gonna do it. I am . I lived alone, had my own stuff, my own life. I gave up everything to join the military. I went to live with my parent again until I left for boot camp. I went to boot camp. I got hurt and it stopped my training. I wa heartbroken. I had to come home and move back in with my parent because I had nothing to my name. Now, I am stuck with them for at least the next months. I have been back from boot camp since late September. They want me to show them my bank account once a week. They have an amount of my own money that I earn that I can spend every week. I want to leave, but my credit is crap and it will not allow me to get my own place just yet a most place do a credit check. I am getting my own car here shortly.

"Emotionally offline I should not be writing this, I have three final project due in the next couple of day and I have not started on any of them. But I do not have the energy to even get started..I do not know what to do. It is too late to ask for extension but I do not want to fail my class that mean nothing to me . Whatever..I guess I will turn out fine because I wa doing well grade-wise up to this point, but it is gonna be fucking painful. Over the course of the last couple of weeks, I feel a if I have gone emotionally offline. I feel like a shell of myself. I am not sure what happened. I think the real downturn started when I wa walking on campus two week ago and saw my ex-girlfriend of a few month with her new boyfriend, but that is definitely not the only thing that is bothering me. It might have been a death-by-a-thousand-cuts situation because if I take an itinerary of what is going on in my life, there is not much there. If my life had a thesis statement, it would be that I have nothing to look forward to. Hardly any aspect of my life can bring me out of the apathy that I seem to be stuck in every day. I do not find any of my class enjoyable, and now the thought of doing it a a career is starting to give me nightmares. I have friend but I do not much enjoy hanging out with them, and overall, any attempt to meet new people just seems to amount to nothing. I have no dating life, and I am still admittedly stuck on the aforementioned ex-girlfriend who ha completely moved on that I dated for seven month and have been broken up for the same length. All I can think about is that if she saw me today, barely able to get out of bed and go to school, I am also certain she would feel even more justified in breaking up with me. I keep thinking about this new person she is dating and in what way he is likely a complete upgrade. I do not even know what their situation is, I am just inventing scenario in my head. I need to stop that. Fuck. The only thing I have is that I am in fairly good shape and my GPA is . although that is certain to go down after this week, which scare the ever-living shit out of me because it feel like the only real thing I can put on my resume . I am also fairly consistent with working out it is not a huge part of my life, but holy shit, if I did not do it I cannot imagine how depressed I would be. Right now, all of the emotional energy I have for the day go to getting myself to the gym at the least. With my career, I am interested in how technology affect people and society like internet addiction, social media, artificial intelligence, etc. That is kind of what drew me to my major in the first place, which is User Experience Design. However, I do little of that the research side of things, which includes talking to people and learning their stories, then coming up with conclusion based on that data on how you can improve a digital service and more the design development side of thing like visual graphic UI design and web development, just building the fucking thing , which I am good with, but it both stress me out and bore the shit out of me. I think it would be fulfilling to be a UX Researcher for a popular social app just because I would be able to study how people interact with it. Or do that for a consultancy agency or something, and start a blog podcast about technology society. I kind of largely detest the Silicon Valley tech utopianism that is sweeping the country, it seems to be making everyone I know and myself unhappy in really subtle ways, but it is become almost a cult of sorts. I could turn what I learn about user research to that. But if I want to keep pursuing this path, I have to keep doing the part that make me depressed design and coding for a significant amount of time so I have just kind of lost motivation to try at all. I know I should just push through, but I have pushed through my whole life and honestly, I am tired of fucking pushing. Everyone is telling me to keep moving forward because I show talent in it the design code side of user experience and it is lucrative but fuck man I can only do this for so long. I would rather use my creativity on music or writing. I have three internship interview this week which is not good to have hanging over my head when I am asking all of these questions. I constantly wonder if there is a better, more fulfilling, and le depressing route to the other side of all of this. The social life issue is more simple, I do not even want to write about it. I need to be more vulnerable to people and go outside my comfort zone, and that is gonna take a ton of work no matter how you spin it. The first part of this video with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem is basically my entire life in a nutshell . Ditto on the dating life, although that might be a little more complicated. I have only even felt attracted to one person since my breakup, so I guess there is more going underneath the surface there. I cannot imagine dating anyone in my current state, but man, the ever-present loneliness really drain me. Is not it ironic though? I want to go into a career where I study people all day, yet I struggle to actually build and establish friendships. I am like a people is introvert, it make no sense. I seem to use daydreaming and fantasizing a an escape. I spend an embarrassing amount of mental time each day imagining myself a a frontman for a successful band I really look up to someone like Father John Misty, I feel we have similar sensibility on a lot of things. And there is just something about pouring your emotion and thought into an album, performing it live and connecting with people through that authenticity, that really make me regret not taking learning music seriously up until this point in my life. I could really use that sort of emotional release right now. Same with writing, when school is not consuming every moment of my waking day I like to read a lot, so I would like to write a book one day on something I care about. I am reading what I wrote and it is kind of frustrating. I clearly have dream and desires, why cannot I manifest them into anything that make me remotely proud of myself? Like am I even depressed? I feel like way too many people here have it worse than me for me to complain about my depression. Maybe I am just a shitty person looking for an excuse not to do anything useful with my life. I am just trying to make it to Friday. My favorite band is coming to my city and it is the only thing I am looking forward to. Its the only reason I am ignoring the thought of suicide..I need a break from all this bullshit. I am gonna schedule a doctor is appointment today to get a blood panel done to see if anything is happening there. I might look into SAD because depression always seems to historically hit me around this time although this time last year wa the happiest I have ever been, so I am not exactly sure . I already see a therapist weekly but I might look for a new one because I am not sure if we are making any progress. I am gonna try to get back into meditation if I can find any time. I just want to know when it is gonna get better.",0.0

"I am actually feeling a little bit like a fraud at the moment, because I have read so many different topic today and realized that there are people who have suffered far more than I have. I have joined this site, to start to try and get some help for myself and to talk about the thing that have caused me to feel like this over the last few years. My doctor ha told me that I am depressed and prescribed tablets, but I refuse to believe this and have not taken them. I know that this is wrong, but I hate the idea of being labeled depressed. Before I went to university, I wa happy, adventurous, nothing could keep me down. I wa in a fantastic relationship, but then I moved into halls, in a flat with six others, who I absolutely adored. One of them in particular, who I fell in love with. Little did I know that he had also fallen for me in the same way, but we were both so shy and I wa in a relationship, that neither of u did anything about it .. until we moved into a house together in our second year with others. This is when everything went wrong. We were always close, really close in fact, and I admitted to him that I kept getting urge to kiss him, hold him and never let him go. He felt the same way a I did, but still nothing wa done by either of us. Then one evening we were both out, getting drunk with friends, we found ourselves alone when we got back to the house and kissed. I have never felt like I did that night since. I did not care about anything around me. We were the only people in the world at that moment. The next morning, we were both a bit bemused and did not know what to say do, so pretended like nothing had happened. The end of term came and we had just moved in to another house with the same people, but were all going home for the summer. I wa devastated knowing that we would not see each other until september. I began to resent my boyfriend who I wa still with and my family were going through problem because of my father. When september came, I went straight onto my final teaching placement, which meant up at work all day, home, eat ,work and then in bed by pm. I wa tired all the time and did not have the energy to go out in the week, but He wa always there for me, and yes, we were still pretending like nothing had happened. After the christmas of my final year, I decided to party like never before. It wa great, but there wa still the issue of him. By now I had been trying to convince myself that I wa still in love with my boyfriend, purely because I did not have the gut to leave him and be on my own. How pathetic wa that. Anyway, we went out to the union for a major drinking session, danced like a couple, felt like a couple, got back to the house and one thing led to another. We ended up sleeping together in his room, he initiated it. It wa amazing. However the next day we were so confused that we did not speak for days, until I told him how I really felt. That I had been in love with him since my first year, but could not do anything about it, that I wa going mad inside because I wanted him so much. He returned my feelings. From then on, we were inseparable, but to anyone who saw u together, we were just very very close friends, who lived in each others pockets. We were having an affair of sort and living a lie, but we found comfort in each other and could not let it go. I know how wrong it was, believe me I do, and I would be devastated if it ever happened to me. We left university in the june of . It wa the worst time of my life. I felt like I wa losing part of me, and wa never going to get it back. Before we left and before the lie really started, I had agreed to move in with my boyfriend in leeds for his final year. I did not want to do this anymore, but wa too chicken to say no, so this went ahead and for the last year, july until now, I have been living with my boyfriend. Things have not been good and I have still been seeing Him from university a often a I can. The most recent one wa a couple of day ago. We have both joked about running away, children, marriage, but neither of u ha got the gut to do anything. It is so wrong and ha made my life so difficult, putting on a brave face for friend and family, pretending that I am happy all of the time. I do not think I can do it much longer. One last thing, while all of this wa going on in my life, my dad wa causing mayhem at home. I wa being pushed and pulled between the people that I thought could get through anything and that were truly in love. How wrong can you be. I wa like a piece of meat being fought over by animals. They constantly bitched about each other to me, leaving me with no - one to talk to. I found myself being dragged further and further down in to a pit which I cannot get out of. I am in love with Him, but will not leave my boyfriend for fear of being alone, I resent my father for what he ha done, I resent my mother for being callous, there is no - one that I have told this to over the past years, nobody who I felt that I could really trust. I do not know what to do anymore. I cry at the smallest thing, hate thing changing at all, but most of all, I cannot see the point of going on anymore. I just want these feeling to end.

But I do not do this because when I wake up I think I can remember..no problem! After all, a lot of these dream are so profound that how could I possibly forget them.. guess what?? I almost always forget the word that meant so much to me in the dream. I remember the subject matter, but it is the word many time that I want to remember. So here go my dream from last night or early this morning .. A little background first for those who do not know or remember who I am.. my mother died quite suddenly from her leukemia in April . We were at odds with each other at the time. I started taking care of my elderly father at the time and he died this past August . I have been wanting to dream about my mother and feel her presence and love since she died. I have only had a few dream about her, maybe .. And they have all been upsetting, never nice feeling dreams. Last night I had a dream of my mother. She wa pregnant and ready to deliver her baby. She looked younger she wa almost at her death but in the dream we knew she wa older like she wa alive today. She said I am ok now I am going to have a baby At least I think this is what she said. My dad wa in my dream a wa my dad is cousin, who is also deceased. My mother is cousin-in-law wa in the dream and she wa sobbing. This same woman wa cry out of control at my mother is funeral. We were at a hotel in Disneyland. Ok everyone. What doe this mean?",0.17357999999999998
"Is it okay to be tired of pretending everything is okay to spark optimism? So I have alot going on in my life -- too much for me to want to spend five hour writing about it for this post. What is bothering me is that lately, thing have been weighing down HARD. My patience is paper thin from year of abuse and I feel like in these last few months, I am receding into myself because I do not have patience for even reasonable flaw in other people. I am tired of being stepped on and dealing with the hand I have been dealt in life I am CLAWING my way out of poverty ALONE, caused by a narcissistic parent kicking me out and attempting to kill me at -- just made . I finally told my boyfriend today, not mincing any words, that I am so fucking tired of being optimistic. That I am tired of pretending anything is going to be fine because alot of the time I feel like it will not. Faking it till you make it ha worked for me in the past, definitely, but being optimistic to KEEP myself from being depressing depressed is not fucking working for me. It is idiotic. It is not that I think thing are pointless -- I am working on a set of skill right now to get myself out of my minimum wage job to get a much better one. amp nbsp But I am just exhausted from trying to not worry other people and not expressing how fucking done I am with everything. Is this normal? Is this healthy? Like I said, not giving up. I am working forward. I just feel like the fake optimism is an extra step and a formality at this point and honestly complaining today made me feel better, not going to lie, a I do my best to not do that because I feel like I am pushing myself on others my situation is so bleak that people almost never know what to say in response anyway because there is nothing close to an immediate solution . But I feel angry and spiteful that people who have been given everything or that can recieve assistance from family telling me how I have to perk up because It is what they do when thing are hard when their hard is I stayed up all the time in college to study and it is hard v I stay up all the time to study my new skillset AND risk my life every day on a chinese scooter that give out at time to do delivery in all of the element to make a wage that is not even livable, having one or more panic attack a day because of dangerous driver . amp nbsp I also feel bad because my SO is always trying to be an optimist. He is somehow perfected this even being depressed himself. Sometimes that bleeds through but he is usually hyper optimistic and it is exhausting. We have gotten in argument in the past when he wa le acquainted with my depression because if I wa not immediately cheered up by him making joke while I am cry to make me laugh let me work through my emotions, damn.. It work sometimes but not ALL the time, seriously , he would get insulted and take it personally that a single joke wa not enough to change my outlook on life and fix all my issues. I feel kind of like I got a little snippy with him when I complained earlier and kept cutting him off and telling him how hopeless I felt and telling him, emotionlessly, I just do not care to be optimistic. I do not give a fuck. What is that going to do? I am already tired, it is just going to make me more tired because I had a feeling that that wa where he wa going to go with it. I feel bad because he is just trying to help. But I am so fucking tired. So tired. I have a hard time doing anything if I do not think it ha a point Even if I hate a job, I am still getting paid, and there is therefore a point to it and I just did not see the point of doing all this. I think I do to make him happy and worry le about me. But I am so upset that I do not have the capacity right now to do more thing to emotionally keep him comfortable. That is stupid. I feel bad, but that is stupid.",0.37973
"I could really use some reassurance that my life is worth living. I took a chance last year and despite depression I reached for a goal, which wa me taking my first full-time job in the field I went to college for. This wa supposed to be my big redeeming moment, the big change in my life. But it is been a few month at my job now, and thing are not going super well. I am facing the very real possibility of total failure. If you can take the time, I could really use a message of encouragement, or if you would like to share your own story of taking a risk and failing and still being okay in the end. I am so upset and anxious right now. Thank you in advance everyone.",0.23516
Nothing is enjoyable anymore. Almost everything that I used to care for is simply starting to have no meaning. I feel dead and lifeless. I used to be very passionate with certain thing but that wa usually meant with me being bashed and shunned upon people. Or simply just a turn off. Everyday I wake up and I am angry. Always wondering what the hell the point of this is. Why I am here. I used to be extremely suicidal in the past and I am slowly falling into that dark pit again. I do not know what to do. It is so hard to be happy and I am just.. I am starting to give up.,0.4665
"My Life Depressed Cycle HELL I have been depressed since my early teens. now. In last year of high school but my grade are horrible, Im MISERABLE at my job but cant quit due to the pay, I completely lack a social life and girlfriend, and have so little motovation I feel like I will flunk out of college if I go. I wa going to go to talk to my psychiatrist that doe medication management for ADD when I went to see her the other day. I literally couldnt suck up the pride to tell her I wa depressed and need a psychologist referal. She even asked how my mood were and I said they were just fine. I feel weird just meeting a random psychologist and dont know how to find a good one. Being a guy I have just sucked it up for the last year and I feel weak for needing help, and even with me telling myself I need help I keep thinking every psychologist listing i see isnt good enough and keep pushing it off like I have for a LONG time. My life is a MISERABLE cycle of depression that I cant seem to get out of. I NEED help but I literally dont know how I can get myself to suck up the pride and go to a psychologist.",0.31377
"Help ruining my University course Second year student here in a UK university. I hardly tried at all in the first year, got generally bad grade on my coursework, but revised just enough for the exam to get a , which is second from the best grade. I also had a few week of socialising separated by many week of pretty much self-imposed and lack of sleep imposed loneliness. So at the time I felt terrible, but looking back on it from second year I had some good memories. Now I am missing half the lectures, sometimes I do not even go to the shop to get food for the day and have a terrible diet, miss enormous amount of sleep, and have not done any work at all. I am already failing, and even with resits I have to get a ridiculous mark on my test this semester to even stand a chance of a worthy final score after the rd year is over. I feel like the only thing that is gonna bring me out of the depression is the pride of getting a good grade, but I am way too pessimistic right now to believe that deep down I can even do it. I am convinced that only friend like me, pity me, and their friend just mock me stealthily. Paid for society but do not go to any. Feel like a huge disappointment to my family tbh.",0.28957

Tonight they both came at me and yelled about how I wa not going to amount to anything and that I pretty much am ruining their current lives. They threw so much at me that it broke me and I broke down in the bathroom. My only remedy for all this pain is my girlfriend. She is there for me no matter what and understands what I go through. Recently I have been slipping a little in my grade All B is and C is and my parent have a very strict rule that if I do not keep good grade I will have to leave my girlfriend.

"No one ha a monopoly on suffering. We keep living our life because depression is pain and illness is suffering, but both do not happen without something happening to us. It is at these time that we are changing in some way..Suffering can give u greater empathy and understanding. It can strip away all the other stuff. So many say they will always be depressed .. that may or may not be the case but everyone ha right to live their life .. suffering included. However, there is a vast difference between simply suffering from depression and finding the courage to live with long term cyclical depression. You can, learn to live with depression. It may profoundly change your life .. take much away from you, but you can learn to live with it. Long term depression is not static .. like any illness, it changes. But we know depression is different because it so cruelly take away our hope of a brighter future. But be stubborn and it will change again. To state in a forum like this, that you want to end it all is a big responsibility to place on the shoulder of other people. It hand the possibility of that personal choice on to others .. which is unfair. Genuine suffering can bring more empathy and awareness of the plight of others in similar situations. There are time when i feel like ending my life and the thought nudge at me constantly but I recognize them now for what they are the depression talking. With each episode I have learnt new way to try and tag these thoughts. Ultimately .. the illness is happening to me the thought happen to me. But I would not burden others with the knowledge of their presence. It is only afterwards that i might mention that i had these constant thoughts, because to tell them in the middle of the depression would only darken their life a much a the depression is darkening my own. Please think before you make threat of suicide in the chat room or forums. There is an increasing number of people using this technique of gaining attention but it is unfair. by all mean we can talk about it .. but saying i am going to do it. is simply selfish and smack of attention seeking. Such behavior is destroying the integrity of genuine sufferer of depression in the eye of so many. It is eroding the help which is so lacking for so many .. and is probably the reason why the mental health hospital near me is a relic from the is and yet the cancer department is brand new and state of the art.

"Alright, this is a bit weird to explain, but I am having a lot of trouble making this decision so I am going to try and write it down. If anyone ha any suggestion or advice to offer I would appreciate it. A while back my brother and I let a stray cat in and fed it, and we got really attached to it. It is probably the most needy animal I have ever met and will sit with people all day, love it when you pet it, and I really like the cat. I wa not thinking at the time, but later I realized I needed to pay a pet deposit like the rest of the people in my complex, so I could keep the cat. So my mother called up our landlord is office and they said that we could not have the cat. It seems really unfair to me that everyone else is allowed animals, but for some reason we are not. I do not think there is anything I can do about this and it make me really sad. We did not want to get rid of the cat so bad that we decided to hide the cat away, letting it inside only at night, and living in my brother is van in the day while we were looking to see if there wa somewhere else we could move to. The problem is, I think I would only barely have enough money to move and I think it would be too risky that my family would lose our assistance if we were to go through with such a thing. Not to mention that I keep my spare money around in the case of emergency and if something bad were to happen, I would not be able to deal with it financially. So the only option I know of that is left is the animal shelter and I really do not want my cat to be locked up and possibly die alone in a cage. I know that it is getting old and that people take younger cat from animal shelter much more often than older ones. I want my cat to have a good place to live and do not want it to spend it final year in a cage, without loving owners. I am having so much trouble making this decision.. I love my cat a lot and want it to be taken care of well and to be happy, but I am endangering my family the longer I try to hide it. My mother and brother keep telling me that it is my decision to make and I just keep procrastinating. So I posted this here because it is making me depressed and stressed out. Are there any option I am leaving out? Do I either have to spend all of my money to move or give it to an animal shelter? They both seem like such terrible option",0.29031999999999997
"Hey, I guess this is the place to post this. I do not really know if I am depressed and if I am I am not sure how to go about getting help for it so I figured you guy would be able to help me out a bit. For the past year and a bit I have been feeling really out of sorts, pretty down and kind of lost in general. I left school in July and started a year out before I went to university. That is when I started feeling strange and I put it down to and still believe it wa just a weird kind of feeling when one leaf school and their life change forever and it is the beginning of being an adult which is a scary time for anyone. Over the year I would go through different stage where for a few month I would feel really positive and enjoy spending time with people and then for a few month I would feel lonely and sad and not go out with friend for month on end. Then I went to university in September and felt very very sad. I think it wa the shock of leaving home, living away from everyone I would ever known and also the feeling of being back at school. I knew immediately that I would made a terrible decision starting university, it wa not what I wanted to be doing with my life and for the week I wa there I would stay in bed pretty much all day and not eat much. I think I lost about a stone and a half and even now, month after dropping out and moving back home I am still half a stone lighter than I wa last summer. So now I am back at home and I have started a job cleaning table in a cafe where I got on with the people I work with and I am back in the same city a my girlfriend again and thing should be ok but I keep dropping into really low moods. A few week ago I thought that maybe it wa depression and so I took some test on the internet with what seem to be the basic questions. I tried to answer a truthfully a possible, you have to understand that depression is not something I want to have, I have known too many silly teenager who think that having depression make them interesting to other people and so they exaggerate emotion to try and look sad to find it appealing. So even though I found myself answering question that I knew were making me seem depressed I answered the anyway because it wa the truth. Things like a lowered libido, I find myself wanting to have sex with my girlfriend far far le frequently than I used to and to be honest a lot of the time when I am having sex I feel that I am just going through the motions. My sleeping which ha always been a little odd ha become increasingly erratic and I have found myself thinking about death a lot. To be honest though I thought that everyone thought about death and dying and that it wa natural. I fin myself becoming very easily bored with people and situation and where I once used to enjoy writing story I cannot being myself to do it anymore. The worst thing though is the mood swing I have and the low mood I find myself in quite frequently. When I feel like this I do not want to be around anyone or have anyone talk to me and I cannot stop myself thinking about bad thing that have happened to me or could happen on a personal level and making myself the centre of blame for them. So am I depressed or is it just, a I am leaning towards, a natural part of growing up and finding myself in the world of work and adulthood and trying to adjust to it. And if I am depressed how do I stop myself being this way? The thought of going to my doctor and sitting there and saying I think I am depressed doe not make much sense to me. I have always thought that with problem of that nature you must be told that you are ill and not decide for yourself that you are. Sorry if this ha been very long and poorly punctuated, I wrote it all fairly stream of consciously. Any help at all would be very much appreciated, I am feeling pretty vulnerable and down right now and do not want to feel this way anymore.",0.38956999999999997

Things got better after a few month and so of course I stopped taking them cold turkey. Obviously not the best idea in the world, aside from this being one of the worst thing to do because of the possibility of reoccurrence, my body went through heck and I had some pretty nasty side effect even worse than when I wa actually taking the med .

I just feel like maybe this is not really depression, maybe I am just a person who doe not handle stress well. Jeeze, when I read this it sound so ridiculous. Part of me know I am being illogical but another part is just blaming me for being weak and not being able to just sit back and enjoy life. Why cannot I just be happy? Why do I have to be so moody? Why am I so weak? It is stupid but I keep blaming myself. I do not think I am bipolar since I have never experienced real high but every couple of year or so my low get really low. Last time wa by far the worst and I would not have been able to get through it without medication and I do not want it to get to that point again but .. I guess I still feel a lot of shame about it. It still feel like depression is being weak. I know, I know it is just like having diabetes and your body need the chemical to be normal but sigh I still blame myself. Last time I told my teacher and some friend and it is like they look at me a if I am contagious or insane. I do not know if I can go through that again. But I do not know if I can keep on pretending everything is alright either ..",0.43099

After he died, about month or so, I started going to a psychiatrist.

"Difference between antidepressent starting side-effects and hypomania? Hey all, So I have read about how SSRIs can send bipolar people who are misdiagnosed with unipolar depression anxiety into hypomania or mania. I have also read that SSRIs can have activating effect during the start up period including insomnia, restlessness, distractibility that sound similar to some of the symptom of hypomania. So if someone starting and SSRI experience trouble sleeping, restlessness, increased energy, increased distractibility, period of euphoria, spends money like it is nothing, increased pressure to talk sing dance, increased response to music and caffeine, starting up old hobbies, etc., how can they know whether it is a combination of start-up side effect of the SSRI feeling much better from the SSRI or maybe placebo excitement from doing something about the depression or an antidepressant-induced hypomanic episode?

Plus I cannot start a new topic so.. Well, anyway, here is how it is Some day I can go without thinking about her, but at night, when I rest my head on my pillow, she eventually run across my mind. When I say she, I mean my ex. More like.. I am her ex. But eh.. this took place a while back. Maybe like.. a year and a half. I met her year ago in High-school. She wa my very first true girlfriend and I did not want anything to mess that up, but somehow I did that myself.. or something along those lines. After a while of missing someone it doe not really matter who wa the blame for what. Sometimes when I make music I sing lyric about her and how I want another chance and whatever. I am not really obsessed with her or anything, but I sometimes want to just forget about her all at once, or wish I could go back years. I guess that might be linked to regrets? Anyway, this whole thing is sort of an ON-OFF type thing, where sometimes I cannot help but think about how it was, and sometimes, she is that last thing on my mind. Sort of like I put her on the back of my mind not to think about her, and save my hurt of later?? .. If that sound right.. Maybe I need a shrink. Who knows.. maybe i just need another girl..

Then I stumbled into this place. I started reading posting and everyone seems so concerned about everyone even though they have never met these people. I have not struggled with depression my whole life or anything like that. I am only but feel so old. I am very, very recently separated let is face it broken up with my ex-fiance. We have dated for almost five year and have a son together who will be two on Saturday. He ha not treated me the best never hit or anything physical like that just never around and he is really not what I want my husband or even the father of my child to act like. He doe have moment of goodness and this is what make it so hard because why cannot he always act like that. I know he is capable of it. I told him we should separate but I know he is been thinking it for a long time. He is been forcing thing because of his family and because he feel respect and blah blah for me. I stayed around because he is the father of my child and face it it is hard to find someone new when you are a woman and you already have a kid. I love him very much and I guess I wa just expecting him to wake up one day and say man I need to change or I am going to lose this great girl. I wanted to separate because I think that is the only way he is going to realize how good of a girl I am and how good I am for him. Now I am scared though that he will never come to this realization or meet someone else. He say he is not looking, but let is face it he is a man. He say he need at least month to find himself. It make it hard on me because we have a son together and for this reason my ex is always coming around and actually now that we are not together we probably see him more. I have no family where I live and the last year have been devoted to my ex and son. I have managed to lose contact with any friend I had and never made any new ones.

"I am and have been depressed since I wa maybe year old. I wa emotionally abused by two confused parents. Depression alcoholism run rampantly in my family - fortunately I escaped the alcoholism. I wa diagnosed a having major depression when I wa about and I have been on medication since then. I have also had intensive psychotherapy and done lot of research on the subject. Nothing era the stigma!! Depression is misnamed. It should be called serotonin-deficiency disorder or something long and fancy so people will respect it. Too many say, Depression? Snap out of it! Or Do something to cheer yourself up. What bunk. It affect every part of your body. Last year I realized that some of my depression wa caused by kidney failure. I escaped dialysis and will probably be OK. But what a relief to have something serious to blame my problem on! Everybody respect kidney failure a a real disease . I had to disown my brother last year because his reaction to my failing health wa to call me a loser and an embarrassment. Very typical reaction from him, although the rest of my family were supportive. I now have no brother. I should have done it a long time ago. It take such a long time to come to a point where you believe you deserve something good in life. I am intelligent, employed and do not do drug or alcohol, never have, but sometimes I feel like a bum, a worthless waste of space, not worth the effort. I have to argue myself out of that mindset every day, and it is so exhausting, and people wonder why I am tired all the time and have no energy. I am very angry, too. I have never had a successful relationship and do not believe I ever can. I do not even believe it exists. No kids, either, but maybe that is a good thing. They take a lot of emotional energy.

"I am working on a new app startup to help you guys. Please read this, I would really appreciate any help feedback. Hello everyone! I am a current sophomore in college studying Computer Science and this summer I decided to work on a new app that caters to depressed suicidal people who are going through bad times. I want this app to connect depressed user to people who are volunteer at crisis center or just regular people in general that are willing to devote their time to helping the users. This app will be similar to twitch where the volunteer will go live and you can see their face and any user can instantly connect with them. First, the user will enter their information like what their favorite tv show movie music artist are, where they are from, and what type of gender they would feel most comfortable talking to. All this information gathered will be used to connect the user with a volunteer that closely fit those preference the user can swipe through all of the option that are given to them and they can actually add these volunteer to a list that they would like to come back to . I want it to be a one on one session where the user can decide to turn his her camera on, or if not, just use the microphone, or if they do not want to do either of those options, they can just use the chat box provided. I want it to be a social platform where user can connect with other user and see what they are doing. Basically a user is becoming friend with their streamer volunteer and other user a well. Also, these one-on-one session can be changed to a room where there can be user to one volunteer and that way more people can connect with each other with like a chaperone . I would not dare dream of making any money from this app and I know I need funding from VC is to get this thing skyrocketing. That is why I am getting all the resource I need from my school is entrepreneurial program and they are going to connect me to the people I need to know. I hate to say it but if I need to make shareholder money, then I will do it, but I do not want to make a single dime off of an idea that caters to people who are struggling through something so drastic. This may sound far fetched but my biggest dream for this app company, is to have a box filled with goody being mailed to user when the holiday Valentine is Day birthday come around that include letter voice message from volunteer saying Happy Birthday! Or Merry Christmas! Or Happy Valentine is Day! followed by more message that ha to do with the user. This box will also include a lot more goody that ha to specifically do with the user. I used to be like you guys. I cannot say that I suffered a much a you guy but I came to this sub a couple of time when I had no one else to go to. I had no shoulder to cry on in my freshman year of college which is why I think this app could actually mean something to someone. Please, we need to try and put an end to the huge suicide rate among child adult in America. Please provide any feedback, whether good, bad, or helpful. Anything helps, really. I can also answer any question you might have about this app. Please excuse my bad grammar, I am a computer science major for a reason haha.",0.15424000000000002

"Aha! moment during therapy So I have been meeting with a therapist about once a week since October of . It is been really great, and ha helped pull me from the brink more than once. Background I am gay, and wa raised Catholic in the s. Guess what happened next! Spoiler I wa bullied mercilessly. If I wa not too gay, I wa too fat, or too tall, or too weird or too unpopular. You get the gist. It it wa not my hair, it wa my mannerism if it wa not my high voice, it wa the dark circle under my eyes. Gee, what could have caused me to be losing sleep? Flash forward to today My therapist guided me through a meditation today that instructed me to visualize and speak to a younger version of myself. I described what I looked like, what characteristic defined me, and how I saw myself. Then I wa instructed to, a myself a the adult I have become, speak to that child and tell him what I wa feeling. I spoke with kindness and compassion and love and respect for that child, and told him everything would be alright. I told him that all of that hatred wa wrong, that it wa incorrect and that those people who say all those nasty hurtful things, they probably are not even going to remember saying it, so do not waste your time holding onto it. And it got me thinking about all of the baggage I have he would onto my life. All the glance and side comment and nasty, hateful things. And how I have internalized it, and believed it. And that is when the Aha! moment came. All this time, I have been so worried about all the bullying that other people did, I wa not even thinking about all the bullying I did to myself. All this time, it wa me. Sure, it wa other people who planted those seeds, but it wa me who perpetuated it, who told myself that they were true. After all, if you say something enough, it might a well be a true a anything else. So there it is. There is one step. It might just be one step, but it is a step in the right direction. There is my holy shit moment of the day, and I just wanted to share with you all. There is hope. There is progress. There is love. And I hope you all are able to find it.",0.2293
"Im wasting my life As a year old currently, I feel like i am entirely disconnected from every human soul on this planet. I cannot properly have social interaction with others without me overthinking stuff that person says. What I mean is, if a friend tell me i am dumb jokingly, I take it at heart. I take everything too literal, I cannot properly talk to others without me being awkward and silent. I cannot talk to people if I have ignore them constantly, if someone address me so they can talk to me, I sometimes ignore them and pretend like I never heard them. If a person say hi to me, I stay silent. I will never get a girlfriend, i will never feel a girl hand, or the feeling of affection, comfort, and attention. I never even got to talk to a girl before. Seeing everyone at school socializing with their girlfriend, hugging them, doing everything for them, absolutely destroys me a a person. I can see why I got bullied. Those time I wa called Pussy Weak Retarded turned out to be true. The physical bullying I received, when they pulled my hair and embarrassed me in front of everyone in class by flipping me off my chair. I understand now, the stuff I deserve. I can see why my dad abondoned me ever since I wa born, he wa never there for me, I do not know what type of man he is or how he look like. The brother and sister I never met, which I dearly wish I could. They are all so young, I wish I could have been a big brother for them. I hate living in isolation and loneliness. As if I wa not lonely enough at school, but now at home. Everyone take their brother and sister for granted, but a person like me would love one of those. My grandparent and mom say they love me, which I do believe, but I still feel no more or le that same, it doe not matter in the end. I cannot do simple activity at school that involve groups, no because a person could possibly screw it up for us, but because I need to socialize. I cannot do sport because it involves me being around people and I absolutely despise it. What am I so afraid of? Being judged? Why am I here? What am I? It doe not matter, I still die in the end anyways. Maybe taking my own life is the answer, it resolve all the pain I have received. Who care what my so called family feels? They must know it for my own personal benefit, they should realize that when I do eventually end myself, that I will no longer feel the pain I once received. I never have felt an emotional connection between any of my family, they are doing their own thing in their life. Nobody at school would care, I only have two friends. Ones I hold dear because they understand my pain. Looks are deceiving are not they? A lot of people in my school consider me attractive and cute, but good doe that do me? I will not get any benefit from it either way. A bit of a description of how I look like, long hair, feminine face, a thin appearance not super thin, I weigh about . But anyways, I simply plan on ending my own life sooner or later, I do not know how long I can last. We have no value, no significant purpose of existing, so might a well end it now. I constantly wear this mask where i pretend i am happy, when i am not. The only thing I do with my life is listen to Joy of Mans Desiring in bed, contemplating my existence.",0.27947

Started out with celexa after I had my last baby, went through some ppd and have not been the same since. I wa on celexa for month then stopped for months, then went back on it and totally had a bad reaction. Then came zoloft, that lasted about month sent me in to some sort of mania, then there wa wellbutrin, wanted to drive off the road in to the lake on that, then came effexor which I thought worked but apparently I also wa going through rapid cycling, I kind of liked that. I spent month on that and about a month on the wellbutrin. Then came paxil cr, wa on that for month but I just cant get past these mood swing and outbursts. So now I have been on Lexapro for almost months, today the doctor decided to increase me to mg and add lamictal for my mood swings. I am a little nervous about starting this new one. This rash I hear about sound scary. I also take mg of klonopin a needed everyday I just wonder if I will ever feel the same again, but then it ha been so long that I do not know if I would even know what that feel like. Sorry to ramble on, but that is my story. I am to start the lamictal tonight. wish me luck!! If anyone ha any input for me I would really appreciate it",0.55333

"Tomorrow the world will go on like always I have never been here.. this wa not a part of the plan but I said why not leave something somewhere since no one else will be receiving anything.

I run away through drug but my depression is beginning to break through my facade of confidence. No one know who I am and even if presented with a companion I do not know if I could ever explain the scars. I hate who I am and how I act, I feel though it is not even me. Social anxiety make me act in way I cannot even understand and the repetition of I am okay is getting old. I have tried to make friend but no one seems to want to know me and it is left me feeling like a sociopath. Insanity overcomes me a I scream, clenching a blade that can no longer quiet my mind. I have tried so hard to not be ignorant or selfish but I cannot handle this anymore. The need of hospitalization and psychologist remind me of the freak I am. I strive for perfection but am the opposite of it. I have so much love that I want to express but have no place to put it. I wa raised religious but have so many doubts, my problem maybe is not ignorance but overthinking, I hope.. Nobody seems to understand subjectivity relativity. There is much to be said but this will probably find it own void. I am dreaming of a different world, but the oblivion of what I do not know plague me.

They made me a shy, helpless, depressed, anxious moron who is not able to achieve anything. Fuck life, it is full of crap.

It is pathetic. It is the only isocial thing I do anymore and I do not even want to do that. Playing a videogame is too stressful. P a t h e t i c.

"When I wa twelve, one of my younger sister got leukemia. Despite my failing memory I can still remember a lot of what happened back then. I can remember being picked up at the park where I wa playing to rush to the hospital where my sister had been getting tested. You could say I wa whisked away from my innocence, but you are pretentious and I am not. I can remember how my mother broke the news to me. And how her voice cracked a little when I asked how bad she had it. I can remember sitting in the front room of my grandparent is place, where I wa staying so my parent could be with my sister in hospital, speaking to my cousin and saying that I felt it wa somehow my fault. What followed wa roughly a year of total disruption. My sister became the focus, understandably, while the rest of u learned to cope with the cloud hanging over us. Where a small rise in temperature could send heart racing. But that ha mostly been forgotten. Not blocked away, just forgotten. It wa another age and doe not feel real anymore. In the past few month the hospital ha been doing a study of ex-patients and their families. Tonight it wa my turn to do the phone interview. I would been avoiding it, mostly because I am lazy and I only ever seem to do thing that I feel will be enjoyable to me. Anyway, so they called through and I spoke. I do not think there were really any surprises, although it wa bizarre when I became conscious to the fact that I occurred to her getting cancer a it or that. I think I only said cancer once in the entire interview. Does that mean I am crazy? Struggling to cope? I do not know.

"Now this stupid posting thing is screwed up - I cannot do anything right Got the old depressed suicide bug again. It is funny because last night i read some article I had written regarding death and suicide, many about saving other depressed person from killing themselves, recognizing the pain that the survivor go through, and not wanting it to happen to my family. And then the thought rear it ugly head, it would be so easy to let myself go, go into that peaceful night, waiting until my mom dy first soon - natural cause and then doing it. Because I am a failure, I cannot do anything else but fail at my job. I used to write in a cave type place - a place where my writing would be secure and it is going away. That is how come I looked at my writings. I had told my therapist that it seems sometimes I feel angry and selfish and that is one of the trigger that trigger the thought of suicide. I have run out of visit covered by insurance I could pay for more but there is no need for visit - I have almost stopped talking. I feel like going home, crawling up on my bed with the teddy bear my husband hate and crying. At the cave web site, the others do not like to hear about suicide so I have stopped writing there it is another site for depression type people - no one go there now . I keep talking about death and suicide to my husband and my kid - and I feel guilty but the word and my thought are obsessed with death. I can make the decision about my mom and my kid, but this halfway limbo concerning my state sucks. I guess this is just venting. My mom ha at least another week to live ..",0.45596000000000003

"Hi everyone, I am new, and feeling kind of lost and shy. To introduce myself a little, I am a year old female. Up until about a year ago, I would never had any problem with depression or any other mental illness, though all of the other woman in my family have depressive tendencies. Suddenly, I started to feel differently in my mind - a feeling which ha gone on getting worse and worse. The last four month in particular have been a downward spiral. I moved house from a big city to a small village late last year, and I am not dealing with the change well. I do not know anyone in my local area, and I do not drive so I am stuck in this little isolated world I work from home . I lack the energy and the confidence to go out and meet new people. I tend to organize run everything in our household so basic routine have just fallen apart, and my long-term relationship is under strain. My partner doe not understand how I feel, while I resent the fact that he is making no effort to recognize the problem and take some action to help. My family and friend are mile away, and I do not feel able to talk to them. This last week, I found out my Mum is having test run for breast cancer. I know it is early day but it is just the last little thing that ha pushed me over the edge. I am walking around either in a state of complete, grey numbness or in a state of unutterable misery, unable to react to anything in a rational way. I have not left the house for days, because I hate the village where I live and being there just sends me into a blind panic attack. I have had an initial assessment for counseling in a city near where I live, but it will be week before I can get an appointment. I know that I need to go and see a GP and get some medication, but I do not have the energy even to pick up the phone and talk to the receptionist, let alone to walk on my own through the horrible village. And I am just so exhausted all the time. The internet is my only point of contact with the outside world at the moment. If all this sound familiar to anyone, please reply - it would be a lifeline for me. Thanks Wizzy.",0.33583

"Hi - I am dad a new member today I like what I have seen so far and have a need to express myself and get some feedback from others. It is so hard to look at yourself.. especially when wearing the dark glass of depression. I am a man in my late is - educated, with family- wife and two great, smart, loving kids, , and . I will try to summarize my story. About yr ago, I wa laid off tech field ..it wa very hard to find another good position. We were so spoiled, I wa making K - K in the past few years. We took it for granted. We built new house since - and did well. We enrolled our kid in a private Christian school a high priority for u THEN - My wife wa in a auto accident and ha spinal damage. She is mobile , but ha chronic pain. She is also suffering from depression. I managed to find another job, but it wa a very dysfunctional place. I had to take a few leave-of absence - then I became pegged a a weak person. They eventually let me go for too many LOA is I am paying for COBRA - we cannot do this forever..the pressure just add to my anxiety. After seeing my psychiatrist, he took me through MANY medicine and even ECT is.. we tried for three year to find the most effective drug. Presently I take Zoloft, Cymbalta, Lamictal,Xanax Valium for anxiety. I also have osteopenia bone density loss , so I take, fosamax and Tylenol narcotic for back joint pain. Lastly, I use Soma for muscle strain. I do not know if the medicine are helping me or adding to the problem..? I admit I lean on some of the medicine a a coping mechanism. I have had so many situational event in the last few years, I suspect my depression is more environmentally caused..? I seem to ruminate on the bad event of the past too much. I am stuck - and just cannot seem to get aggressive at my job hunt. We just sold our bedroom house and are now living in a three bedroom apartment. I feel guilty that my family ha to go through this. I know that I have skill and experience but I do not have the self confidence - my ego is on the floor . My sleep pattern is crazy and my appetite for food and sex is GONE. My wife is getting frustrated with me and doe not always build me up .. Her depression ha her down too.. With two depressed parents,it is very difficult to support each other. I feel stuck and do not know what to do..sometimes I just feel like giving up.. Any comment or thought would be appreciated!",0.36935

"Hello everyone. I am here because I am starting to have doubt about my mental health.. First off I am a year old male college student, and up until about year ago I think I have been fine..but lately I am not so sure. For one thing I cannot seem to concentrate or focus on ANYTHING anymore and it is becoming very frustrating. I find myself daydreaming or pacing only minute after I sat down to do something important and because of it I cannot get anything done. I cannot even focus on thing that should be fun, or the thing I used to be dedicated too. I have also become very philosophical. I always find myself spending a lot of time thinking about life and death, the nature of existence, etc..But it seems like it becoming an obsession. I always feel like I am wasting time but I cannot bring myself to do anything constructive. Sometimes I am disgusted when I realize how much time I spend simply pacing back and forth. I also cannot fall asleep at night anymore..I just lie awake thinking and I cannot make it stop. I also have constant fear about becoming old and having regret about how I lived and what I accomplished. I also have constant regret about the past. It seems like there is nothing I can do in life to satisfy myself and it driving me crazy..especially because for all the ambition I have I have no motivation whatsoever anymore. Also it is hard to explain, but I get the feeling that I cannot feel life, if that make any sense? It is like time is moving so fast that I cannot even realize it. Anyway, I wa never like this before and I have no reason to be like this now. I do not have relationship problem or family problem and I am not religious. This all just came out of nowhere with no apparent cause. Basically it ha come to the point where I know something is wrong with me but I do not know what. I have kept telling myself this is nothing but it getting more intense and now I feel like I am spiraling into a void or something. I guess I am simply here to seek some opinion on what my problem could be. Thanks a lot for taking the time.

"Severe Ibs and depression combo is a death sentence Hi I posted a few time on this forum last year April sometine due to my depression and I am posting again because well, it is back. So I am just going to write a few thing about myself and why I am posting here. Im a year old guy from London, England and I have been depressed for about year now. I wa also diagnosed with IBS about or so year ago. I wa at university for digital medium and I finished. My first year but when the second year started my IBS symptom got worse and I wa I physically unable to go. thankfully the university gave me a year off and said I can start my second year next year after I get better. However it just seems to be getting worse not better. I can barely go outside without going through severe anxiety attack which lead to horrible pain in my stomach for which I need to go home to go toilet for, when it wa really bad I would feel very faint and start having panic attacks. It reached the point where I wa practically housebound. I spent like month playing games, watching anime and TV show and the pain started to get a bit better. Then day ago I went toilet and it happened again, severe pain, feeling very uneasy and then boom out of nowhere crippling depression, the wave just hit me. I began feeling hopeless again, I felt unsatisfied with life. Not just my life, but life in general. Thanks to my love of Anime, Webnovels, Games and Movies I started to wish my life wa like that. I know it is childish, but deep down it is just how I felt. I could not accept reality, it wa too mundane for me and I wa not satisfied just sitting there everyday just watching or reading things. But I could not do anything about it because everytime I try to do something my IBS kick in and basically cripple me. And I know that even if I try and do something, it is not really what I want. I do not want my life to be normal. All I would really be doing is trying to avoid the pain that it will never happen. I know this is long and it might be hard to emphasize with me if you do not really understand it. But I just felt like I really wanted to say something and see if maybe there were other people like me. I guess you could say I am looking for friend who can understand me, I am hoping that maybe it will make living a little easier if I have people to talk about the thing I love with who also understand what it is like going through depression. That is the conclusion I came up with anyway Thanks for reading",0.332

"I have been in a constant rush to try and get on my foot for the last three years, but I always end up doing nothing about it. I have forgotten what motivation is all about. Hey there, I just turned . And this is my situation About three year ago, I used to feel excited about everything. Finishing school, starting my study at a university, being self-sufficient, finally doing what I thought wa my future career. I am not sure what happened, but I started losing my drive. Things did not look a exciting, nor entertaining. Never having even kissed a girl, I felt alone and loveless. Still, I felt motivated enough to start working on my social skills, met a few people over the Internet, even got a girlfriend. Thanks to the Internet I have a social life, a ironic a that sounds, even though it is not that good . Fast forward to this year, I wa able to date a couple more girls, had a good time but they all ended too soon. I have never been able to have sex with the girl I have been with because I lost my sex drive in the course of these last years. Also the extremely low self esteem and self hatred do not help. Today, I find myself unable to even have a conversation with someone, mostly girls. I cannot come up with anything to talk about and I feel like all the thing I learned about social skill have gone away suddenly. How do people have such natural conversation with one another? How did I manage to do it before? I feel like I want new friends, I want to have a good time, but cannot figure out where to go, or what to do to achieve that. Regarding my studies, this year wa a slow one. In the time I should have completed of my career, I only completed around . I started visiting a psychologist because I cannot get myself to study for my exam I am not cooperating much with him , and all I do is worry about it though I never take up the responsibility. I am fully aware of the fact that thing do not come if you just sit and wait, but I cannot bring myself to do anything other than complain. Meanwhile I feel like my mind want to run, but doe not know which way to go, and my body will not budge. I think about how I am getting older, and I am wasting every second of my life. I am completely lost and feel like everything I do is going nowhere. And I do not even know how to end this post, just wanted to put this somewhere and hopefully get some solution or word of encouragement from people who have been through the same.

"Glad I can help! Firelizardee ha helped me a lot over on the effexor room that is where most of my post are . I have never really posted my story, but for what it is worth, here it is I live in northern New York State where I grew up on the family farm. My brother and I run a feed hardware farm supply store. I have got a terrific wife and two daughter age and . My depression hit in January during a bout with the flu my youngest daughter wa hospitalized with febrile seizure and that might be what put me over the edge. My nervous breakdown seemed to come out of the blue, but I would had an extremely stressful six month between job, illness, and adoption. I am also a hard driving firstborn perfectionist, and several family member have had alcoholism or suspected depression. So I guess depression should not have been so big a surprise, but it was. I am a happy person with a great life! But I feel like I have been right to the edge of the precipice and looked down at Hell. Now I am doing everything I can to ensure I do not relapse..but I actually think I am a better person having been through this. I am much more appreciative of a good day and I am much more attuned to the suffering of others. It is amazing how many people I know have similar problems. And I hate that it ha to be this way, but suffering doe bring me closer to God. I hardly dare say that depression and anxiety wa worth it ..the memory of the anguish is still too vivid, and besides, it could come back tomorrow. But right now, today, I feel more contented with my crazy, precious, stupid, dear, wasted, amazing life than I have been in years. I am very lucky to have stumbled onto the right medication the first time, and to have a supportive family that did not tell me to isnap out of it .

"Thoughest time of my life, and honestly i cant show it So i meet this girl for nearly year ago. I would say we are probably more then best friends, we are soul friends. For over a year we talked about me moving to their town, so i can get closer to her, her husband and her kids. We have literally been talking for nearly year straight. I understand that she is getting abit tired of me now, but i just moved week ago and she ha bearly talked to me once. She is so busy playing video game right now, the only one that really ha helped me this past week is her husband. I feel i moved so far for nothing, and now it KILLING me. and since i wont have internet for a while, im getting bored out of my mind, and my depression is hitting me so hard.. I did confront her about this though, but she keep saying she is depressed and the only way for her is to play games. Even tho when i play games, she keep going to private world with friends, and whenever i a for an invite, she ignores it, even tho it pop up a big icon on her face. My life ha been so hard lately, my mom lost her kid in court, other then that, my stepdad made an false accusation of me doing stuff to a child becasuse he is a fucking moron and wanted to ruin my life for fun. And no, i didnt do anything to a kid just FYI . I won the case but it wa ever lasting years.. Other thatn that ive been bullied for years, i have lived alone for since i wa . Aswell im a very VERY jelous guy, so im not gonna deny that, and here is one of the issue with this MY EX fucked my life up with cheating on me, and since then i have big trust issues, aswell i tend to get very jelous now when my best friend is getting new friend and seems to have more fun with them then me. Tho, i know my best friend would never leave me since she wanted me up here anyway, but the jelousy that she is having such a good time with others are ripping my life apart. The past Months ha been depression only, and Honestly if people ha gone through a much a me these past month with suicidal thought every day, they would of gone mental. I have a very strong mind, so it take alot to take me down mentally, but for some reason, im lost and i dont know what to do. Half of the time i just wanna sit and cry. Before i wa friend with her, i had a depression but it wasnt that bad. I didnt have friend then so i didnt have to go through what i have now, For some reason i feel like im not designed to have friends, that my life should keep going on the PC without real friend",0.38329
"Am I crazy for wanting to get back with her? So let me give you guy a bit of a timeline first - April we met at work, became really good friends. She still had a boyfriend, but broke up with him about week after we started hanging out. - June I told her I liked her a more than a friend, she did not feel this way towards me at the time. - July she started dating a guy she already knew, we will call him Jake. - August she broke up with Jake. Jake made her feel terrible for it and cut her off completely, leaving her to say that she hated him and wanted no part of him. - September October she told me she is always been attracted to me, but wa not ready for a relationship. I wa in love with her at this time, after knowing her for a while and her being everything I want in someone. Suggested being FWB, which I took her up on. But whenever I tried to make a move on it, she did not seem to want to do anything. We hung out just u every day, would always be talking, but for some reason when the time came around to make a move she never seemed to want to do anything. Mid October she said how we would be better off being friend since we did not seem to be going anywhere and that it wa hurting her self esteem, and that she started talking to Jake again. She is currently still dating Jake, but from what I hear from her are on the verge of another breakup. And now I want her more than ever. I wa absolutely heartbroken when she cut thing off with me, and I am still not over her. And she know this. If she cut thing off with Jake, I do not know what to do. I want her back more than anything, but at the same time it is like she put me through such pain and I do not want to chance that happening again. She is everything that I could possibly want in a girl, and I cannot imagine myself without her. And we are still friends, which probably is not helping to be honest. But she is still my best friend. Am I crazy for feeling this way?",0.30345
"So here is my situation .. I want to go to University .. Problems I do not have a cent to my name, parent will not give their ok on the issue and I have not had a job in over a year and there are no prospect in the near future. I could go behind their back and apply for a loan but I would just feel a lot better knowing they were ok with it all, I do not want money from them. Some meaningless minimum wage job is not going to make me feel good, if anything it will make me feel worse about myself. I have not accomplished a single thing in my life and feel this is pretty much the last straw to do something meaningful, but day after day there is another block and I have no mean of getting around it, I am dependant on my parent who are usually the block and I hate it.

The way I feel now scare me. I thought after I lost my grandma and dad I held it together pretty good, but after my aunt died I felt like I lost everything. I have always been a very strong person someone other people leaned on. Now I literally cannot get out of bed, I do not want to talk to anyone, or see anyone.

"This is a great topic. It look like people associate with what wa shared. I wa laughing a little because for awhile I wa so hypersensitive to sound I would not even consider turning anything on that created noise, even the noise from light wa too much. I used to go to a counselor who had a radio on in her waiting room. I could not stand it and used to turn it off. Then someone would turn it back on, having no understanding of what it wa like to be me at that moment. That is funny to me now. I still do not like noise but I am lucky since I have pretty good control over my environment. For awhile I wa working in cubicle and wa not sure I wa going to make it. The one comment I wanted to share wa what I experienced when I did turn the TV back on, read the newspaper, listened to the radio. I went without it for two years. What I experienced wa the way the news wa presented. I wa captivated not by the word or circumstance of stories, but the tone of voice, the selection of what sound bite to use, the background chosen for a shot. I am still fascinated by all that and even dreamed the other night I had been hired to be that person who decides how to present something. In my dream I wa having a moral dilemma. My integrity is important to me and, in my dream, I wa talking to my bos and trying to explain the emotional angst I wa in. She kept saying, give them what they want, who are you to decide what is best for them. I woke up before I decided to quit or stay. But those word stayed with me through a day, who am I to decide what is best for someone else? What I do now is selectively listen to the news. I like NPR and sometimes enjoy McNeil Lehrer. I find if someone is expressing a strong opinion I will get annoyed if the presentation doe not also include an opposing viewpoint. My main issue is selective presentation. I feel disrespected if someone is asking me to just trust them. I want to know what are the observation leading to a conclusion. I want to know what level of uncertainty there is. I do not like anyone telling me how to think or feel. I am perfectly capable of creating all the drama I could ever use, on my own. I am not clear where to place blame for all the drama the industry of information put out there. I know someone is to blame. If only I could find that person or group then my hatred would be perfect. I am kidding about that last sentence. I am just trying to get a rise out of someone reading my share--I am being frisky. I support public broadcasting and free speech. If I wa in charge meeting would last forever because everyone would get a chance to speak. Would not it be great if there truly wa free speech in America. Would not it be great if the principle of dissent wa truly an American ideal. Is not it supposed to be?",0.305

When a man speaks to me in public I am suspicious of his intentions, and when a man wa openly flirting with me two day ago I left the store and then became afraid that he might follow me home and had to go sleep with my year old in his room with the door locked that night. I am even nervous and suspicious of men I have known, like spouse of friends. Background. My husband is in the military and ha been deployed. He is been gone since September and since the beginning I have had a fear of being in the house alone at night and it ha progressed to this. I am a fairly sane person for the most part.

"Where to start.. Well, I guess I am here because I think I have depression. I did recently talk to a therapist about it a couple of week ago. I guess it did some good because I feel like I may have gotten to the root of my problems. She told me that I wa depressed and that I have probably had a low grade depression for most of my life. I kind of thought that I wa depressed, because when I would read an article about depression with yes or no question I would usually answer yes to nine of them. The original reason my wife and I went to a counselor in the first place wa because my wife wa mad about my occasional habit of looking at pornography on the internet. I understand this bother her and I do not want to do anything that will upset her. I could never give her an acceptable reason why I did it. I really do not know why myself. I do not think that I have an addiction to sex. It doe not dominate my thought or life by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I think that I am pretty tame compared to most males. Anyway, this cause a lot of strife in my marriage because my wife considers this cheating on her. Well, back to depression. We got to talking about this in counseling and the counselor asked me if I would ever been molested before. Oh boy. Well, this ha always been the big secret part of my life. When I wa or years, a female cousin of mine, who wa about year older, played some touching game with me over the course of summers. It wa all just touching, but I knew it wa wrong. She would tell me that I could never tell anyone because I would get in trouble. So I did not, until that therapy session. No, I had never told my wife because I always felt embarrassed and like I wa to blame because I did not do anything to stop my cousin. I pretty much told the therapist and my wife of course , everything that had happened to me. I got REALLY upset and probably cried more than anytime in my adult life. I felt somewhat better after talking, but inside I still feel ashamed and responsible for it. The counselor said that because of those incidences, I have had a low grade depression all these year because of holding it all in. I have ALWAYS had a hard time expressing my feeling about anything to anyone. That is just me. I told the therapist that I could see the low grade depression in my day to day life, but there are time when I feel like there is a huge, massive black cloud on me. I can be doing just about anything when suddenly I have this overwhelming feeling of dread and emptiness. There are time that I feel like if I could wish for my own death at that instant, I would gladly do it. When I do not have those bad lows, I just feel numb. The therapist said I might want to try medication, but I already take two different thing for chronic physical conditions, and I really do not want to take anymore drugs. I do not like doing anything that I used to do reading, sports, movies, etc. I have a teenaged son who is just terrific. He is extremely intelligent and just a great kid. I do not want my condition affecting him anymore than it already has. My wife is sometimes supportive, but I think she is tired of my moods. I have not had the porn problem any longer and I feel like I have gotten past that. The therapist attributed those time of porn weakness to depression and looking for a way out . I feel like since the counseling session that the low grade depression ha gotten worse. I am glad that I talked about the thing that happened and how I have felt, but I really do feel worse than before. Is there anything I can do besides more drugs? I just do not think those are the answer. Maybe I am wrong. I do not know.",0.24327

"I just do not know how to deal with this shit anymore. I can remember being depressed and having anxiety a early a year old now . I am sure I have been happy some time along the way but I cannot remember. I think most of the good time were just when I had enough energy to pretend and delude myself and convince everybody around me that I wa normal and healthy. Unfortunately, a time ha gone on my time of stability have gotten shorter, and my major depressive episode have only gotten much worse, and lasted longer. I have dropped out of different college and have quit every job I have ever had, most of them with literally no notice. I have seen doctors, I have been on different medication with no noticeable effects. I am see a doctor now, but am hoping to get in to see a psychiatrist or mental health specialist soon, but that could be a month or two away at this point. I am just completely exhausted at this point and do not know how much longer I can take it. My parent just keep telling me I need to get a job, like that would make everything better. It definitely doe not help that they try to get me to go to church with the every other week or ask me all the time if I have met any girl that I am interested in. They cannot understand that just taking a shower on any given day or leaving the apartment to buy grocery is a monumental task. They ask if I am suicidal, a if that is the only way to tell how severe my depression is. I do not consider myself suicidal, but I no longer have a desire to continue living. Every day I wake up is another disappointment, another day of being incapable of doing anything and feeling sorry for myself. I am pretty sure the main reason that I am not suicidal is that I am convinced that I would fail or just would not be able to go through with it and the embarrassment would be too much to handle. As much a my family frustrates me, I understand that they are trying to help but they just do not know how. They have supported me financially on several occasion before now. Without their help I would almost certainly be homeless or dead by now. All I want is to not feel this way anymore. Every time I leave my apartment I am tense and in fear of the people around me. I escape for social situation a soon a possible only to get home and feel completely worthless. I can accept that I will always live with this illness, that it is never going away.

I love my husband we have been together for year and have child together. He went to Thailand with his dad last year to visit his brother who life over there working a a teacher, but before he left he found this website forum owned by a bar owner there who us bar girl prostitute a waitresses. To make this long story short he went with one of these bar girl while he wa there and it took my child to find out the truth because I wa too stupid to find out myself lol One found picture of her in his organizer and the other found text message on his cell phone. I should have known something wa up a he never leaf his cell phone on anymore when at home anymore since he came back. He sits on that forum when at work and also at home all the men on that forum talk about the bargirls and post picture of them also. My daughter sent a text message to the woman and she said a lot of hurtful thing to her, I wa worried for a few day that my husband would find out she wa contacted and blame me. We also found pill he ha been taking that he got from India called tadalasil which is a form of viagra, a far a I know he never had a problem sexually so why is he taking these pills? who know lol My cousin called me a couple of day ago and said he posted a message on that forum saying he want to go back to thailand again and what excuse could he give me for wanting to go, she said he also said that he posted he doe not want to cheat on me just fuck other woman when I am not around. She check the forum for me a I do not want to see it but it hurt just a bad when someone tell you what he puts. He doe not have any friend really here where we are because all he doe is work so I do not know if the men on the forum are substitute for real friend and he is putting what they would find interesting or what. I do not drive and we live out in a rural area with no real neighbor so I do not get into town barely and I do not have many real friend here a we moved here to do some job work. So that saying LIFE SUCKS really seems to fit lately lol My concern lately is sex transferred disease such a AIDS a I found out that thailand is known a a sex trade country and many have the disease. Prostitution is illegal there but they allow business to operate like that bar due to the money the male tourist bring there. The government is going to give asia and africa million of dollar to help research AIDS but they are not going to make Thailand help stop the spread of the disease by shutting down place that promote prostitution, they worry about bird flu or about people carrying weapon onto plane but they do not care if men bring a silent killer like AIDS back into our country and infect their spouse or lovers.

"I have lost the last of my hope for my turn . I M think that without making the conscious decision to, I have given up. I think I have just reached the point where I have stopped kidding myself that it will all get better or work out someday like people always tell you. What I cannot seem to shake is the faint screaming in the back of my head trying to get me to fix everything, the one who still belief happiness is possible despite my entire existence thus far indicating otherwise. I work at a job in an office doing pointless work that I used to swear to myself in high school and college that I would never wind up doing. day a week I wake up at , leave at , work from -, and get home at my parent house at . Then I eat dinner with them, watch TV with them, and they go to bed, so I turn in at , watch more TV, and go to bed myself. On the weekend I typically do nothing. When I do go out or hang out with a friend, we do nothing, just sit and watch TV or a movie. Unless we can find some fictional world we can discus Marvel, GoT, Star Wars, etc we do not even have much to talk about. I maybe have - friend that I do this with, and again, not too often. I do not currently have, nor have I ever had, anything even resembling a love life. I wa foolishly in love with a close friend who felt nothing for me thru high school and most of college before I managed to stop kidding myself on that one. I have never had sex with or even kissed a girl. The closest thing I ever did wa cuddle with a really close friend, and I even fucked that up because I overthought everything a always and did not make a real move, and she instantly lost interest gave up on me, and now we are barely even friend anymore. I am an introvert with no desire to change. I have no interest in going out to bars, clubs, or anything people my age for some reason enjoy. All I want is a person to love and spend my time with and provide each other with the human contact we need. My idea of the perfect evening would be cuddling on the couch with a girl I love and watching Netflix, just enjoying the closeness, maybe some kissing. Sex is something I want but not even on my radar right now. My life goal can be summed up in saying I want to find my person have a kid or two, and do what I can to make them and myself happy. I just honestly do not see the path to that reality, though. Nothing matter to me anymore. Just my parents, and I can honestly say that I am safe a long a they are around because I care more about them than myself. However, if they were gone tomorrow, I think I would be close behind. I just do not see a path out of this pointless existence that I feel capable of taking. I feel like I am just serving a sentence, going through the motion until it is mercifully done.

This mean that I feel like I can never release my feelings, and that it feel really greyscale at times, and on the rare occasion I can cry it hardly help a it is basically a panic attack at that point. I do not really know why I am posting this, but doe anyone else deal with this? I would love to hear from someone who maybe ha advice on how to handle it. Love all of you",0.2132
"Ok here goes. I actually feel like I do not deserve to be looking at this site. I have been sitting here all morning reading through everyone is post and have been think that I have no right to hate my life. I have a good family, friend and have had experience other yr old would only dream of. But there is something in my head telling me that my life suck and nobody care if I am here or not. Then the real me kick back in and I think I am stupid for thinking that. STUPID. Stupid for thinking I have no purpose. So that make me feel even worse. I fear. I do not know. Being alone and rejected I guess. I do not do I often but when I am having a fat week I have purged and over exercised. I do not know if this is because I really think I am fat or. I do not know why else, but I am not overweight. I have never told any one any of this in person. I cannot do it. I hate sympathy. When I am around my friend I am totally the opposite. I am so hyper and half the time it is not even an act sometimes I just cannot control. Other time I do have to put it on just so that do not ask me if anything is up but I have never failed to fool them. Anyway that is enough",0.3405

"Anyone else hate talking about depression specifically because all the attempt at help feel fake? Guess it is stupid posting this, all thing considered, but I am a moron anyway and besides that I am also looking just to see if I am alone in thinking this. Like at this point I would rather just hear comment from people who are also feeling down. Help from others make me fucking angry at them, especially strangers, because it doe not do anything. It doe not make me feel better to be told thing will get better! , it doe not help to be told I am loved, and in the event people bring up stuff like you will never get to have a family yes this doe happen a though that matter it make me want to actually hurt them in real life. I do not and cannot, but holy shit. I do not even like when friend try to make me feel better anymore because it feel like they do not even get the point. What suck though is trying to get over that primal instinct to not kill myself. I do not particularly want to live and I really do not want to live past , but my dumb animal brain just think owie death and pain bad and will not let me do it.

"Alienating family Do you ever get tired of saying you are okay when you are not but you do not want to talk about it? So instead you just stop talking to them but then you feel worse for alienating your family and they have no idea why or what is going on with you. My family ha never been super close. We get along with each other and talk to each other but we are not a support system and I do not feel comfortable talking to them about my problems. I feel like I will be judged and gossiped about so I just keep it to myself and a a result wind up pushing them all away. The only person in this world I feel I can talk to about my problem are my husband and I know that is a huge burden on him to be my only outlet, my only friend. It is putting a strain on our relationship and I blame myself for this. It is a lot of pressure to put on someone. Living with a person with depression is hard enough under normal circumstance whatever normal is but add the burden of being the only friend, the only person that knows, the only person period. Eventually that only person is going to get tired of it.",0.36357
"It is been almost years.. years.. Holy shit.. It will be year in May.. It still feel like yesterday when I got that call from your dad, telling me what happened. And I remember dropping everything I wa doing at work, and rushing to the hospital. Slowly walking into the room, with your family gathered around you, that is when it hit me, and I broke down.. I lost it.. Could not control myself, and I could not stop crying. When I had to say goodbye, it broke my fucking heart.. Losing my best friend, my fianc , wa the hardest day of my life. But every year after, the pain slowly faded away, and it did not haunt me anymore. But last week, when your dad called me and said that he would be in town for work, and wanted to get together, it made my day. Had not seen heard from him in about months. But last night, when your sister called, and told me that your dad passed away in his sleep from a heart attack, it wa like the whole world had stopped spinning again..

"There truly is no hope. For any of us. This is the bleakest truth of all. Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little string attached to every choice you make you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you will not know for twenty years. And you may never ever trace it to it source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is it is what you create. And even though the world go on for eon and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never come or it seems to but it doe not really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. And the truth is I feel so angry, and the truth is I feel so fucking sad, and the truth is I have felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just a long I have been pretending I am OK, just to get along, just for, I do not know why, maybe because no one want to hear about my misery, because they have their own.

"Hi all, I have just registered here.. I have been depressed for quite a while, my dad died when I wa and my best friend died when we were . After the death of my father I wa in counseling, but my counselor stopped coming to school to see me and I do not think I ever got anywhere from it. I am currently , almost and male, from the UK for those keeping count I have felt crap for ages.. I hate my job, and doing that along with the stress of my final year of university sent me on a downward spiral. I would worry so much about my workload, but have no motivation to do it and get out of the situation. I hate being single, but cannot find someone special who like me, who I like back. I want to leave my job, but I cannot afford to until I leave university and get a job doing something I want to. I had thought about suicide, but I know the pain of losing people close to me, and I could not inflict that pain on someone else. I considered cutting myself too. I thought that maybe if I wa hurt, I could get extra time for university work, and maybe someone would help me. But I realized that I should not do that, and should see someone about it. I also did not have the ball to do it. I think bad thought a lot but I do not think I could go through with them. I wa worried about going to the doctor though. My previous experience with a counselor ha put me off them, and I do not like talking to stranger about my problem - that said I do not like telling people I know either because I feel that they will judge me. I wa also concerned about medication because I do not know if I like the idea of chemical altering my brain apart from alcohol that is! But about week ago I finally went to see my doctor. He ha put me on mg of Fluoxetine a day, although I am not sure whether it is doing much. I have been having headache and going a bit dizzy a well a getting sleepy among other side effect . It is weird though, I do not know whether I am feeling better or not, my friend say I seem different and better for taking it but I still feel bad at times.. I still lie in bed at night worrying. But I think maybe I need to take it more and see how it effect me long term. I guess even on medication we all have good day and bad days. I wa scared to tell my mother that I wa on anti-depressants, a she work in mental health. Some would see this a a blessing a she understands the field to a great degree, but I wa worried because I thought that she might think I wa mad. I eventually got the courage to tell her after about day though because I wa very dizzy and I thought that she would suspect me of being on illegal drugs. She is being very supportive now, while still keeping enough distance that I do not feel like she is worrying too much about me. It is good to know that she understands that it is going to help me cope though.. and she say it only a minor drug compared to what some of her patient take to stop the voice telling them to do things. Anyway I decided to look for somewhere online where other people know what it feel like, and I am glad that I have found this place. I hope I can make some new friend here, and maybe I can help a couple of people too.",0.36214
"Frustration I do not understand why I am depressed.. I am pretty sure I am depressed, I do not feel much joy in life, I have trouble feeling enjoyment outside of compulsive harmful activites, I just feel numb, pointless. My thought turn to suicide quite often, but I would never do it. I can say that I think of suicide somewhat le than I used to.. so there is been improvement. I do not understand why I am not better, or what else I can do outside of medication. I run, I work hard and do well at work, I am a dedicated father and spend lot of time with the kids, I am dedicated to making sure they feel loved and cared for, their need are ahead of my own. I try to do new things, and I do them well, but it all feel so flat and empty. I do not understand what else I can do to improve.

"The last few week I have slid back almost a far a before I started treatment. Just when I thought I wa improving. I finally went to the drop in center called Sunshine Place, a someone wa giving a talk on depression. The counselor spoke with me for about half an hour after her talk and said she thought I needed more help than my GP wa giving. For the first time in a few month I actually broke down and cried again - which is very annoying to me. She wrote down the number of the Mental Health Center with some suggestion for them. I rang the next day for an appointment and that wa hard just to ring . She had told me I might have to wait a few week for them to see me, but they made an appointment for the next day. The psychiatirst there wa okay I did not even cry like I normally do when talking to a new doc but I told her I wa tired of telling the same thing to every new person. The short of it is they are changing me from Lexapro to Avanza and organizing for some CBT. I see my regular GP next Tuesday so I am pleased they said they would inform her of the medication change. I wa also warned that I would probably feel a bit more depressed while the medication change wa taking place so I duly warned Mom and Matt not to take any notice of any strange behavior. Matt a usual just laughed and said yeah, Mom is going to go psycho . Now I just wait for them to contact me about the CBT. If I do not answer any post you will know why, but I will try to just put a little emoticon up every now and then to let you know I am thinking of you all, and that I am still listening.",0.0

He also eats unhealthy and is overweight, and I have attempted to help him get healthier about a month ago, but he stopped listening to me about. I love and care for him deeply but our family is at our wit end with what to do.

"In college year ago I wa the victim of a gang rape. I have read up quite a bit and identified with all the stage and normal reactions.. I went through the self blame, and guilt, and anger, and depression, and I came to realize it wa not my fault. I never reported it and after a year I decided the best thing would be to forget about it. I pretended it did not happen and went on with my life. I forced it out of my thought until it wa no longer a struggle to do so. Eventually I almost did forget about it. I never thought about it and when the subject wa referenced in other context I never even thought about my particular experience. It almost became some movie I saw, or some girl I knew about. I am married now with a four year old child and I have a really great life. About six month ago I started having these rape fantasies. I have been too embarrassed to ask my husband to act them out, but he doe oblige in rough sex, and I started asking for it more often. I have felt confused a to why I would want this with my husband and it is always with him .. I do not desire this with anyone else when I have this history. It started me thinking about them even again. Then I started having nightmare about three week ago. Horrible realistic dream where I actually wake up and I am still hallucinating that men are holding me down. Last night I punched my husband full in the chest because I thought he wa attacking me when he wa just trying to wake me from a nightmare. This along with the COMPLETE lack of sexual desire where before we had a very healthy sex life. I am a big fan of the STOP THAT approach to self help, but I cannot seem to stop this. I am beginning to dwell on it now. Also I try not to ever deny husband and with the high job related stress he is having right now he is seeking sexual gratification every night.

In th grade, I asked my mother if I wa a manic depressive because I had read about it and I felt I had all the symptoms. She scoffed and said it wa just normal teen hormone that made me feel that way. I love my mother and she ha always been there for me. I used to call her at in the morning cry and she would talk to me until I felt better. However, when I call her up today, she still doe not understand when I tell her I am depressed. She think I need to get up and start doing thing until I snap out of it. I try to tell her I have bill screaming at me and I still cannot get out of the house to find work. I think she is in denial. Now, with all of the information I find on this site, I think I may even be bipolar. When I found the man I wanted to marry, I warned him that I had experienced many deep depression in my lifetime and that it wa probably likely to happen again someday. He said he would stay by my side no matter what, and he has. Unfortunately, it is painfully apparent that he ha no idea at all how to handle it. When he try to talk to me and cheer me up, I say mean thing to him until we are both raising our voices. Let me tell you, when I am like this, I do not back down either. I usually say something hurtful and then grind my teeth in anger for a while. He get mad too, but it is also painfully apparent that he forgives me. Then, I feel like a real jerk. I just started seeing a psychologist, since I have not had a job since last August and it is clear that I do not know my way out of this. I have only met with her once, but I think I will like her. She ha told me to do a few simple thing everyday until our next meeting on Wednesday. She want me to get hour of sunlight everyday, minute of exercise, and try to make a simple daily schedule to follow. I am a bit worried because I have not been able to do them because I just do not sleep right anymore. It is am and I have not slept yet. I may fall asleep in a few hours, only to toss and turn and then wake up in the evening feeling like crap. I have tried some medicine but they do not help. Have any of you had this problem? What did you do?",0.0
"Me too. You want a friend. You want someone to be there with you when you are weak, and someone to comfort you when you are down. You wish you were not alone but you feel invisible. You are trapped in your thought and nobody can reach you. You feel like you cannot do anything right, like you are useless. Everybody ha friend except for you. You are a burden and nobody actually like you, you just exist. You push people away because you feel like you do not have anything to offer, so you would rather just be left alone. You cannot wait to die because life is pointless. You do not want to get up anymore because you have been knocked down too many times. You are so tired and weak, and the weight is crushing you even more. Every day that pass is the same and you feel like you are waiting for nothing.

"No lodging for the sad Being depressed sucks. That is easy to grasp. Most people who are not clinically depressed understand this. What they do not understand is that being depressed and honestly trying to get better is extremely difficult, and our ruggedly individualistic society doe not give a single fuck about you. You need help? Fuck you. Your wealth is not just something you have, it is seen a a reflection of your worth a a person. Poor? Sad? Find it difficult to wake up? Find it difficult to complete things? Do you procrastinate because of underlying psychological issues? Fuck you, you are just lazy. The clear message capitalism sends me is that if I cannot work, or I cannot work enough, or I cannot work doing a high value job , or if I need help to get better so that I can do those high value job , I probably ought to just go die, because I am clearly worth nothing.",0.29702

"I am not sure where to start. I have been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, disassociation, and bipolar. I am also a cutter, suicidal, I hear thing and see things. Needless to say I do not deal with stress very well. Sorry this is not a good introduction but I really do need some help. I am a college student only because the VA veteran Affairs is paying for it through their vocational - rehabilitation program. I am unemployed. For month I have been fighting with social service just to get food stamps. I finally got them. Beforehand food wa scarce. I have had eviction notice and by miracle my roommate and I manage to get just enough money to not get evicted at the last minute. I have missed class and therapy and other doctor appointment because I have not had the gas money to get there. I apply for job every day, but I have absolutely no luck getting a job. So with all this any normal person would become naturally depressed. But me, I am losing my mind. I can be happy and laughing and goofing off with my boyfriend one minute but the next I am kicking and hitting and seriously hurting him. Then we end up in some stupid argument where all I say is shut up or go away, or whatever. I just do not want to hear it. I know missing my therapy appointment ha not helped. I do have a psychiatrist appointment in week and a therapy appointment in weeks. But I need some help now. I have lost all my motivation to do anything. I have been in bed today for hour and I just feel so angry. Angry and fearful. The only thing is that I do not know what I am angry and fearful about. My mood shift so quickly and swiftly that I have lost complete control of who or what I am. The more I try to relax the Angrier and more fearful I get. It is like I have to stay occupied just to keep my mind occupied and keep it from traveling a million mile a second. I just need to get back on the semi - sane track. Right now I am a million light year from there.",0.3293
"Well, it is been a year now since I tried killing myself A year ago on December st I tried to kill myself. I spent a week in a psych ward and have been on lot of med and doing lot of therapy since then. The therapy ha helped quite a bit, I have slowly learned how to listen to myself and how to take thing one day at a time. As far a med go, my anxiety is much more controllable and my sleeping med actually work mostly so I cannot complain too much. I do not think I am ever going to overcome depression. I have kind of learned to live with it, sure, but beating it probably will not happen I am way too cynical to beat it. It is just how I am wired. There is a lot in life I probably will not get to experience because of how I am. And I still do not know how to change that, or at least make some good out of it. I guess what I am trying to say with this post is, I am not sure if I am happy or not. It is the not knowing that bug me. I know I am better than I wa a year ago, but I still feel lost, and I do not know where to go from here. Every day is just a haze that I trot through. Sorry for the rambling.

"What is wrong with me? I just want to know what is really wrong with me, should I get help or something..I often think about myself like I am a negative person. Some people describe me a cold a I do not really have any genuine reaction to anything just pure neutrality some even say I lack empathy. I keep most of my feeling and thought for myself and the only thing that is wierdly funny to me is dark humor and misfortune of others.

But I dread it now. I am not in the position to get therapy. I know the issues, not much more than others out there. I have always just kept busy and got on with things.

"Dead is better than alive imo. I would not say I feel particularly sad or depressed, a a constant state. It is all over the place. But I think I do want to die. I choose to believe there is nothing after we die no afterlife, no heaven or hell, no reincarnation, or godly ascension. Just a beautiful, peaceful nothing. And it just seems so much better than being alive. When you are alive, you feel so much. Yes, there is happiness, excitement, surprise, love. But there is also sadness, anger, hate, jealousy. Why would I chose to bare such thing when death can provide none of these things? All the good stuff about living doe not weigh out the bad, in my head.

"Getting over a girl Hello everyone, I have been subscribed to this sub for a while now but always been a lurker and never posted anything. I feel that this is the best place to get advice and help for what I am going through right now.. So I am a year old guy, I have never had a serious relationship with a girl before. I met this girl a few week ago and I instantly liked her. She is the most amazing girl I have ever met. She is funny, smart and so beautiful. We started texting snapchatting. I told her I liked her and she said she felt the same about me. We started talking and we met a few time and thing were going really well. Last weekend she stopped over at my house and we watched some Netflix and had such a good night with each other. I knew I wa in love with this girl and I could honestly see u getting in a relationship in the future. After she left my house the following morning she started acting weird. I asked her what wa wrong and she said her ex boyfriend wa going crazy because she stayed over at my house. She then said she just needed to be alone for a while and that we should stop seeing each other because she still ha not properly got over her ex. It wa so horrible, I started cry for age and I could not stop. I still feel so upset about it and I do not think I will ever be able to get over her. How can I get over her?

".. being that I do not know anyone here yet, but I feel like I am about to boil out of my skin if I do not get some of this out. Last week I left the house for the first time in nearly a month and saw my doctor about the state of my head. It wa the hardest thing I have ever done that did not involve burying a loved one a I wa brought up to believe that one should not talk about one is feeling with other people. Although the sawbones made all the right noise I do not know if he even belief me. I do not know if seeing him wa the right thing to do because since walking out of his surgery all I have had is deeper anxiety, more guilt, and a feeling of total and utter desperation - I think it is actually a little worse than before. I feel like this is not going to get any better, ever. I am scared .. I do not know how this is going to end up for me. I cannot see a way out. I have been depressed for a very long time but since losing my job a little while ago I have hit the proverbial bottom. I have suffered from anxiety for many year but recently it ha been getting worse - I had my first panic attack last year. It doe not matter what I try to do to stop it, all I can think about is death, pain, more death, failure, and yet more death. I have been having horrible nightmare for month and have not slept properly since my teen . Long story short ish when I wa little the Infamous They told my parent I wa gifted . They had high hope for me. I won a scholarship to a good private school, where the other little girl made fun of me. Then the scholarship ran out and I had to go to a state school. Where the other little child made fun of me, spat at me, physically attacked me and eventually my parent had to take me out of school altogether. They found a better one, where the other kid continued to make my life hell. When I wa about or I started self harming cutting my arm with broken light bulb glass . My mother noticed once, shouted at me, and then never raised the subject again. I continued to do it until I wa about . My dad bullied me when I wa a kid basically he subjected me to about year of mingled disinterest, public humiliation, and emotional abuse. Then he did a disappearing act three year ago - leaving my mother in financial trouble. I have not heard from him since. I have wasted my life. Nothing I have ever attempted ha succeeded - really nothing, and I have never been able to please the people I wa trying to please. I used to think I wa a talented artist wanted to be a comic - book artist but now I have no self - belief left. I have not picked up a pencil in week and I cannot even bear to look at any of my work. I cannot do anything anymore and there is nobody I can talk to - my mother is my only close family and she doe not believe in mental illness if I mentioned it to her she would, at best, get angry and tell me to grow up stop being so self indulgent . I have two close friend who have their own problem to deal with. I am seeing the doctor again on Monday but I fail to see what he can do to fix the fact that I am a useless failure. I am so scared and confused. I have been cry for about a week now and it is getting really tiring. I am scared that maybe what I think is depression is really just an excuse to attempt to explain my pathetic behavior, that I am really a hypochondriac my anxiety is now constant and I have convinced myself I am going to die any minute from any terminal illness you would care to name and I am wasting the doc is time resources. He offered me sleeping pill but I said no a I wa afraid to have such thing in the house. Basically, not a good week.

I just cut tie with nine people who I considered family for almost years. Their negativity and inability to understand what I am working towards ha literally taken a huge toll on myself. Friends are suppsed to support you through the good and the bad but instead I wa being anchored and every time I felt I wa getting out of it I wa pulled back down. The fact that I wa so attached to them made this one of the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life and it took every ounce of myself to finish telling them I did not want anything to do with them. They do not understand that in order for me to become a doctor I have to commit a lot of time to my studies. But if I cannot show up to something such a drinking I get absolutely torn apart by them. It is like they hate when I am productive but they enjoy seeing me partake in stupid shit. They have told me that I am a liar and a terrible friend on numerous occasion and it is just too hard to even reason with them at this point. Did I over react and should I iron thing out with them?

"Hi everyone, I am new to this site and my name is Elie. I am a -year-old married mother of three girl and one angel baby boy who wa born still . My child is age are year old, year old then it would have been Conner Charles. When we lost Conner due to an underlying infection and when I had the amniocentesis the infection got to Conner and he died a month later. That wa very devastating to u but I have had a lot of support with an infant grief group in our area. After we lost Conner three month later we got pregnant with Charlene and she is so beautiful. Anyway thing were going good oh I forgot to mention the fact I remarried my ex husband. We were divorced for year and we got back together . One day when the baby wa month old my husband accidentally spilled hot coffee onto Charlene is leg and she had a blanket sleeper on so she wa not that bad. It wa bad enough but because of the way the burn looked due to the absorption of the stupid hot coffee the doctor had her removed from our care until they could further decide if the baby wa abused. I wa dumbfounded I have known this doctor for hears with my girl Marissa and Jessica, so how dare he. I wa so upset, but we have a DSS worker in our life because of my middle daughter who ha mental retardation, she is in a residential home because of her behavior which in a way wa excellent for us. Our worker seen and knew Charlene before the foster care and then when she finally saw her at foster care she did everything in her power to get the baby back and we did six day later. We are constantly in and out of court now because of this and then my husband wa feeding the baby oatmeal and I wa warning him to be careful she flail her arms, well she flailed and knocked the spoon out of his hand and the clump of oatmeal landed on her face .. we cleaned her up not noting anything bad a she did not cry or nothing she wanted to eat. She ended up with a blister on her cheek in the spot that the oatmeal touched. We almost lost Charlene again. I went into DSS and said my husband wa no longer going to be in charge of the baby and they felt better and I also said he want parenting class and they liked that idea. But this is my problem, how do I get passed this. I have a counselor already but you can never have too much support so I came to this web site. I cannot even make love with my husband anymore. I resent him for putting me through this when I have been the most careful mother around. We also live with his mother because financially thing are tight and right now it better we do because DSS note it is a very supportive environment and I have a lot of help which I do but I cannot leave otherwise I will have DSS up my back quite often. My husband feel that sex is the cure all to depression, he keep hounding me and hounding me and I just do not want sex. When we first got back together this second time around thing were awesome and we had so much fun but then we lost Conner, then had Charlene and then these burn and losing her and going to court. I have no say whatsoever even in my own room which depresses me but soon I will try and figure out how to get out of this. All I know is my husband better respect my wishes, I just cannot make love at the moment. The last time wa four week ago.

"They told me that all they can do is replace my hard drive, but they cannot recover my year of bitter-sweet memories. So I bought an external hard drive, thinking that everything would be safe on it, right? If I am gonna spend on something, it should at least be good at something, right? So I exported every thing from the past year onto it. Recently, my computer cannot even read the hard drive anymore. I went to the customer help service and they said that they cannot do anything to access my data and all they can do is replace it within warranty . All my graduation photos, friend hang outs, and all just precious moments, will have to go. I have always been looked down upon. I wa never up to standard to anyone.

"I am trying to go back to school after dropping out of college many year back, and I have got this real supportive boyfriend who want to help me. Problem is, he is got this need for me to go out there and change the world. He keep saying I need to be better than everyone in my class, and that I need to be hyper - prepared before I even start class. I do not mind boning up on the class material beforehand, but he want to help me come up with thesis and bring those to my undergrad prof for help, and he want me to read a whole bunch of text from my chosen field before the semester starts. He also want me to study anatomy because, a he say anatomy doe not really change , so I can be the go to person with whom all my classmate will want to study. I am really bright and would like to make something out of myself, but he is got such high hope and he want me to do way too much way too soon. I do not even know for certain what I want to be at this point - getting back into the liberal art program just seems like a good start towards deciding and acting. All this pressure from him is making it hard for me to even take the baby step I need to take to make anything at all happen. When I try to tell him it is too much pressure, we wind up in a shouting argument actually, I wind up doing most of the shouting - he just ha this way of pressing my buttons.

"My story, i have to get this off my chest. Life suck Hello everyone, This is a post about my life basically, i just need to get this off my chest. Its a long post but i just have to do this. Let me introduce myself first. Currently im a yo boy who turn in March, I live in Belgium grammar will be bad sorry . I have older brother, loving parent who are still together. And oh yeahh i have a very cute pupper a well. Financially everything is fine. Basically a family some people only can dream for. I mainly play on nintendo console switch, ds, gba, n and the MMORPG runescape dont laugh I consider myself a extravert to my friend but an introvert when im talking to girl lol or strangers. I have always had a rough time fitting at school. Our elementary school wa VERY SMALL, it only had kid including kindergarden . I wa always the odd one out , but because it wa so small i had friend. We played alot together and it wa a ok time really. but when i wa most people around me started to notice that i made weird random noises. And that i made small movement with my shoulder unnatural one . Friends got annoyed, parent got annoyed, everyone got annoyed. Eventually my teacher screamed at me telling me to shut up, RIP ME. Eventually mom took me to a specialist and it turned out i have Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, if you youtube this you will get extreme case where people shout fuck and ass, and move uncontrollably all over the place. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH ME. I think Tourette affected my life ALOT it still does!! . I wa always a really shy kid until i wa , i started to accept my tourette and wa a happy yo. -- HIGH SCHOOL from to yo, it devided in class . This is where the problem started, when i just started high school i wa scared but excited like everyone. Unfortunately for me i got the SHITTIEST bully in my class. I had no friend in year , they made fun of me becuz of my tourette i didnt tell them becuz they wouldnt understand . It got to a point where i just smacked someone on the head with a baseball bat. Teachers knew of my situation so we both got week detention. I wa depressed during that year, you know the teenage life, it hard. Year they changed me to another class and they were OK. They didnt bully me but they didnt talk to me either. They just left me alone really, during those year i had friend who i talked with but he also had his own friends. So most of the time i wa alone. But that friend had no common interests, so i ended up playing runescape all day, u can talk with other player there and i had plenty of friend in there. It felt awesome to have friend and i spent all my time there neglecting my studies. But somehow i passed the first year lol. I thought year wa bad, but then i met year different school . I got bullied even more in this class, they called me names, ignored me, humiliated me in class and started bitching if they had to sit next to me. Luckily they never got fysical with me idk if thats the right word . In the middle of that year I decided in the middle of the fucking winter it wa snowing in morning to take the bus mom wa always home and it wa near our house and to step of early. Spent hour in a small freezing cold chapel playing on my nintendo ds, go to my house after mom left and spend playing game in my room. After day the school called, my mom found out. I wa stuck and told her everything about the bullying, about me feeling like absolute shit and that i had no motivation to go to school. She let the teacher know, went to school, got me to a psychiatrist. The bullying stopped, but they still ignored me, i still hadnt any friend and i still didnt feel any better. I somehow survived the next month and passed. If i had . lower in total i would have failed that year. The only way i felt better wa with playing runescape. YEAR - IS IN THE SAME CLASS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE, in year three people joined Year kinda went the same a year believe it or not. The classmate were ok, they didnt bully me, they talked to me when needed but that wa it. I spent my time with some kid i met on the playground. But u know they were those kind of friend u just spent time with becuz nobody else is around. They never invited me to go to party or to hang around or anything. This year wa also the st year i told them about my Tourette Syndrome i got some damn weird look at time and i didnt even realize i wa making sound . They understood, they acted more nice to me, i didnt feel left out so much but wa still unhappy. And on runescape i got into a community clan , made some good friend there. It wa the only place in the word i wa truly happy. Year , same class a last year. people joined and of them became a friend of mine. To be completely honest he is still one of my best friend today, but i come back to that later. Lets call him J, Ok so now i had a friend. We had a small group of people now, S other classmate who wa nice to me , J and me. others from another class joined the group somehow and i finally made some friends. We started going to party and they invited me. Unlucky for me they dont play runescape and have different interest in gaming, thanks to this im not that close to them. But i wa finally starting to be happy becuz i had friends. All the small thing that bothered me sitting alone, always last chosen at sport etc etc.. , bothered me alot le becuz i wa super happy i finally found something positive in my life. I survived year and fairly positive compared to year and . We all graduated and college time arrived -- COLLEGE This wa last year, so this is super recent. I decided to study orthopedagogie , it doesnt have an english translation. Its working with mentally disabled people or troubled young people, stuff like that. Ofcourse I begged my parent for a student room, i wanted to have a great college life like in the movies! Everyone say it the best time of your life and you should enjoy it to the fullest. Oh boy i wa so so dumb for believing it would be that easy. And ofcourse i also joined a society. Finally growing up like an adult and living alone, I WAS FREE. In my class i got along with most of them, we had some good laugh during breaks, went to our class etc.. but i wa the only one who had a student room unlucky . So ye that wa that. In my society i tried making friends, but it didnt work out really. I missed some first important party becuz i decided to go with some classmate i still think to this day that this wa a huge mistake , when i went to party alone to make friend because i realized my class wa lame they already a friend group . I didnt know and still dont how to make contact with them and make friends. I wa really really really lonely last year, i just spent all my time playing runescape, talking with my online friends. November i met someone and we became super super super super close. he is american, not lover just friend . We still talk to each other everyday. Man we even were planning to go to japan together but my mom wont let me. But coming back to that later. During the weekend i had my old friend group from highschool, we still hang out x per month, we still do. But they mostly spent time studying and hanging out with their uni friends. They didnt left me out or anything but i had lost alot of contact with them. I failed of my courses, i decided to call it quits. I wa happy that i could finally leave that student room. uni year wa HORRIBLE. I liked the study i wa doing, so i decided to try it again but in a lower degree, it in a school for adult . Its hard to explain but basically i ended up with out of people to be and have kids. It wa class x a week and internship idk if thats the right word . day per week. I wa working with adult who had a mental disability. Last year i never had internship, only class. It turn out that Orthopedagogie is not the study for me. I dont want to do this the rest of my life. I had officially quit november . -- We finally arrived to the present time, thank you for the people that made it here. So here i am, a year old boy almost , wasted . year in uni, wasting parent money.. I have no idea what i want to study next.. The only study i consider doing is social work, luckily for me u can start in february. So i have to do some shitty job from november - february. I still have my highschool friend who i hang out with x per month? I have a loving brother and parents, good financial situation. I can earn some quick cash for month and go back to study. But to be completely honest.. I DONT SEE THE FUCKING POINT. My whole life i have felt lonely, sometimes with a good reason, sometimes really without a reason. I have dealt with depression not officially diagnosed , or atleast felt like i was. To be completelty honest. I feel like a sad little fucking sack of shit. What have i achieved in my life? Fucking nothing. I cant even think like a fucking normal person, people think im weird, i dont have logical sense. Everyday i have to force myself out of bed. Its been like this for so long now that im starting to get used to it. Even now that i dont have a job until feb, i simply dont have the strength to get out of bed. I sleep hr per day just so the day pass by faster. I dont feel like going out, i dont feel like talking to people. Runescape wa always my escape, but i simply do not have the motivation to even play runescape . On the outside i still act normal, i laugh and act like everything is fine so my parent wont worry. Whenever i have a job they fire me because i work to slow . Once i worked in a storage for a store and had to get the order from customers. You have to use common sense all the time, and they said i didnt have that enough for this job. This happened x.. Remember when i said that i have tourette syndrome, well i always told myself that it also doe have a mental side to it. I can come across different then the normal person , or use the wrong word in sentence to express myself. And i interpret thing differently at times, i usually need to hear the explanation multiple time and they have to explain it very clearly. My parent just said im a slow learner but with hard work i get there . This fucked me over so many time in life, and whenever i tell people friend about the mental side of tourette they all have that expression on their face. The face of ohh that explains alot, but i also feel so sorry for you . Im so fucking sick of it, im not even sure if this happens becuz of my tourette. Im really starting to think this is just all in my head and that im just retarded. my iq is average tho . I often imagine myself having some disorder to make myself feel better, i really dont know what to do with myself. I feel like an absolute loser who cant even think like a normal person. Last month i bought myself a nintendo switch some game to cheer myself up. it get me trough some day but in the end i still end up having no energy to get out of bed. BUT i feel like an arrogant asshole writing this, i have nothing to complain about.. Alot of people had the worst childhood, or had a traumatic experience.. I have a family many people can only dream of? financially im good. I have the chance to try studying again.. I HAVE NO REASON TO FEEL THIS WAY AND IT MAKES ME GO INSANE. Im having alot of negative thoughts, and i cant get them out of my head. I dont see the light in the end of the tunnel. Not stuff like suicide or self cutting btw . As i said earlier i met someone a year ago trough rs. I can always talk to him, i never met him in person but we discord at time and message each other everyday. I feel more connected to him than my IRL friends. They have no same interests, other life goals.. How sad is that? Fkn someone i met online is my best friend? He is the only that know how i feel but he doesnt understand how i feel. He try to support me, but it doesnt help. -- Im not making this post so everyone feel bad for me.. Im just so sick of life.. I dont know what to do.. My parent have their own problem and think im over exaggerating.. Grow up son? Everyone ha to get a job Grow up for once . But they dont know what it feel like to drag yourself trough the whole day atleast i hope they dont . They think im just lazy and dont want to work.. I feel isolated from the world and i cant get out of it. Ok god damnit im re-reading this post, at this point im just rambling.. Idk what i expect from posting this here.. Maybe it just to give my empty brain a boost.. I will just end this post now or i keep adding stuff. EDIT i have no clue how to get the text all the same size",0.0
"I often ponder the idea of giving up completely. Has anyone given up completely? How doe it feel like? I have had extreme depression for years. For a long a I can remember I have tried so hard to stay alive. There wa a point in my life where I gave up. I remember my mom wa beating me and I put up my hand to block the belt and I wa crying. I remember after one of the time she struck me I started to think what if I gave up? And I just shut down. In that moment I stopped putting my hand up, stopped crying, and rolled into a ball while mom kept beating me for a few more minutes. For a few year after that I stopped caring about my appearance. I got so fat and I just kept eating and eating. I stopped caring about my grade and did not even try. I would just turn in a blank paper with my name on it. During high school I woke up and started to try again even though it wa really hard. Since then I have not stopped. I regularly do thing I do not want to do in an effort to make it by. I get up at , I shower every day, I go to the gym, I do my homework, study, etc. Currently, I have been working my butt off to be able to join the military to get away from my parents. My depression is acting up so much, it is getting really hard to keep trying. I often find myself daydreaming and pondering how good easy it would feel be to just stop what I am doing and give up. Get in bed, stay in bed, go eat, eat some more, and more, finally not caring about my appearance and just not doing anything in general.",0.30716000000000004
"We were all given about five minute to decipher what the fuck this meant. Now, Mr. Runge had a reputation for being a tough teacher. He would not let you get away with ANYTHING. If you fell asleep in his class because you were out all night in some cornfield with a bonfire and a bottle of Jack, he would kick your desk in such a way that your head would fly upward at warp speed and your hangover would instantly get very very bad, and then suddenly disappear. Mr. Runge had some freaky special power that student could not tap into. I knew what the acronym stood for. But that is only because my high school boyfriend wa a year ahead of me and gave me a head up on how the first day with the Jolly Green Giant would play out. He is going to write this on the board, make you feel incredibly stupid and then it will be over. TINSTAAFL, pronounced TinStaffel. There Is No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. Runge went on to explain that free did not exist. The free lunch at college tour were paid for when your parent registered you were charged a service fee. Or, more on my level, Clinique never REALLY ha a Free Gift with Purchase . Because, you see..you have to make the purchase, dumb ass! And they over charge every other product just enough so that you are really paying for your free gift. This burst my bubble. Because now, whenever I take something marketed a free, I know I am paying some sort of overhead or some poor schmuck is working extra hard so that I can get . ounce more of my favorite shampoo for the price of the regular size! You would think that I would have held on to this knowledge while looking for apartments. While scanning the ads, I bypassed the one that used word like full of character , because I knew that meant dump and TLC needed , because I knew that meant dump. The one I honed in on boasted country living, quiet, serene, pond, lot o land and everything included! I love where I live. I cannot say it enough. If I did not think raccoon would eat me at this hour, I would jump on top of the roof and scream to the surrounding hill I love you and all your coniferous smell and the creature you shelter! Yeah, apparently the rooftop would make me a tad wordy. My landlord are awesome people. Salt of the earth. Nice, down-home, trusting folk. And, a the contract for country people reads, Coon Hounds Must Be Owned and Bred . I had never seen a breed of this type until I moved here. The momma dog wa so sweet and gentle and quiet. She wa quite the fatty too! Then suddenly she wa not. And in her pen were ten little squeaky pups, eye shut tight, blindly falling into food and water dishes, only to be rescued by momma. Cute, no? Who doe not love puppies?? If you bring Jackson up, I will have to cut you. It is been about month. Puppies have found their voices. All ten of them. And even the momma is begging for a release. Tigger is in the window, constantly doing a head count to make sure everyone is in their place and not a single one wanders off into oblivion. He is exhausted. Momma is exhausted because at night she performs a constant howl that crack my heart. She is begging to be released from those needy fucking kid for at least ONE night of respite. And I am exhausted. Because momma will not shut up and deal with her fate and every time a puppy so much a peeps, gaymancat is all over my head doing a get-up-because-they-might-run-into-traffic-and-get-hit-by-one-of-the-four-cars-that-pass-by-here-at-night dance.

"In a bad headspace after a breakup with someone who finally made me feel like thing would be okay It is been a week since I returned from a six month exchange program overseas. There, I ended a y relationship with an addict, who I still cared for but could not love anymore. Then, of course, I fell in love with someone. We were inseparable for the six months. As I struggle with depression, anxiety and schizoaffective disorder, it ha not been the easiest for him. We planned to end our relationship and continue a friends, but just could not bear to at the departure gates. We decided to try a long distance relationship, but after a week, he is had enough of me. He ha his own problems, and we live hour apart with a h time difference, so I do not blame him at all. I do however carry a lot of resentment for myself for being so down in the past week and pushing him. I used to be really sociable, but a multitude of issue have led me to slowly isolate myself from people. I still have friends, but they either do not actually gaf or they have their own problem and I do not want to add on to their burdens. It is also very difficult for me to meet people without any alcohol or drug to calm the anxiety something I am trying to stay away from a my addiction problem have led me to the psych ward. Besides, how much can friend be there for you? It is you alone in your bed staring at the ceiling til noon the next day for day on end I have had terrible insomnia since coming home . I am still on school break, cannot really occupy my mind by going outside to meet friend or take a part time job or just walk around due to anxiety and psychosis, and all the thing I used to watch do to cheer myself up music, slam poetry, writing, youtube, netflix, game I have associated very strongly with him a we have very similar habits. So anything that could make me pas the time make me sad. I have loved and lost many time and I know it get better eventually, but currently it get very very dark in my mind and I am not sure what I can do to survive in the meantime. I am in a very bad place and feel very anhedonic and suicidal thought are back having been accumulated from all these problem .

"I have been having a difficult time lately. In addition to my mental state of disarray, I have a medical condition that can affect my mood. My medication ha changed lately my body ha not caught up the difference yet. The last few day have been particularly bad, especially at night. The familiar sensation lurks again on my upper leg. Scissors. Half-dozen line -- my usual, though in the past I would sometimes keep cutting until my self-hatred wa momentarily spent. Pressure on the blade to force the skin to gape slightly and bleed more. I am not proud. I knew it wa not the best way to cope. I did at least take the precaution of using a sharp blade, knowing that a jagged blade could leave a jagged wound, and of lavish aftercare. I washed it out with rubbing alcohol, which cause renewed bleeding but wa necessary to keep everything clean and infection-free. Covered everything with a jumbo Band-Aid, the kind kid put on skinned knees, and have not dared to look since. Afterward, I wa afraid that I wa back to my old ways. I told myself in near-hysterics that this wa strictly a one-time backslide. The surprising part is that I believed myself. This doe not make me a cutter again. This doe not mean that I have lost everything that I have gained. All it mean is that I have been having an extraordinarily bad time and resorted to extraordinary behavior in order to cope. My situation will improve. My body chemistry will even out. It is better not to cut, but I am not a bad person even if I do cut. The word are stupidly simple. I do not care. They are my magic that keep me going.",0.32783
"I want to pay off my debt then kill myself. I came from a really poor family, worked hard during primary and secondary school. Got a scholarship for college which paid me k a year a well a covering my school fees. Gave parent the money, it paid for the bill a well a my sibling is school fees. Thought life wa good, studying what i love. However, i got bullied until i cant take it anymore and requested a change of class, the school rejected my request. I then requested to take a semester off school, but the contract for the scholarship state that i have to complete school by year or the contract will be terminated. Failed a module and i have to extend my time in college by a year, which caused my scholarship to be terminated. Which in turn placed me in a k debt. Now, i do not have money to pay for school, so i had to leave. Im out without any qualification except for a secondary school cert, with the organisation that offered me the scholarship requesting k per month for installments. I have always looked forward to my dream job, i wa so close, i volunteer every weekend to get experience from that job. Now it feel like everything is taken from me. I appealed to have my scholarship reinstated times, explaining the issue that i had, giving them the medical report from my doctors, bringing up the volunteer work i did. But on the latest attempt, i got a call saying that they never planned to accept my appeal. It really feel like everything is taken from me.

I Could Use Some Support Right Now Yesterday my best friend of five year attempted to kill their self. I am currently being blown away by school grad school if it really matter .

This is midterm week and most my prof are understanding but the one class I am worried about the prof gave me the option of writing and being stuck with whatever mark I get or not writing and the weight being shifted onto my final but I need the feedback to decide if I am going to even stay in the course because it is incredibly difficult. It just feel like nothing is going my way currently and it is so hard to study or focus. side note another prof let me write a told them like I did the other that I wanted it a a distraction and said that if I did bad they would shift the weight to my final.,0.19593
"I think I may have been on this forum it looked different back in when I had a major bout with depression and anxiety due to some serious financial worries. I have always been prone to this I guess, but I am starting to figure out that it is big, nasty life-changes that trigger it. Well, here I go again. This time it is relationship-related. My wife and I are on brink of divorce. I found out almost a year ago that she ha been emotionally involved with another man, and wa no longer in-love with me. We somehow muddled through the next several months, even though I found out it wa still going on, we kept trying anyway, and thing were still tolerable and ok, I guess. We still shared same bed, got affectionate, cuddled and even made love . About week ago, I discovered that it still had not ended, and they were actually conspiring on getting together in March. Well, all hell broke loose and thing got worse than ever. I am now in a separate room, sleeping on a single bed, and I am miserable. I resumed Wellbutrin when this all started last spring I took Wellbutrin for about month when I had my episode in , and have been taking it since. But since this really bad turn of events, I knew I could not take it, and to be honest, even before I discovered again, my therapist told me that I need to revisit my doctor and prescription because I have got some serious anxiety issues. So now I just started Zoloft mg day in addition to the Wellbutrin. I do not know how thing are going to turn out. I am in limbo while I give her time and space to figure thing out. The Zoloft I think started to kick in today, but not in a good way. I am actually feeling MORE depressed when I came in this morning..I almost broke down cry in front of my computer -argh! My mood swing are horrible. All I can think about is going home and crawling into my bed and taking an Ambien, even though I hate that bed and want to be in the big bed with my wife. I almost wish at time that she would just say, That is it, we are done , so I can know what is going on and just move on with my life. I may end up single and lonely anyway, but at least I will have the opportunity to look for someone else. Right now I feel like a prisoner, being starved of basic human needs, like hugs, touches, affection. Does not that sound lame from a guy?? Well, anyway, here I am..here for the ride..",0.44333
"When I wa , my babysitter molested me many time over the course of year. Many of the time she would make me dress up in girl is clothes and she would take me out that way. I am now. I still cannot have sex. I still cannot go out into public without having severe anxiety attacks. And when I am at home, I find myself cross dressing sometimes. The shrink with whom I have spoken have never been helpful so I am hoping this post find someone who may have some idea of what I went through and am going through now. Please write if you have any idea to share.",0.282
"Despair is the normal state of my life I have not drank though. I have no urge to drink. I just want to stop. Stop moving. Just end. I keep picturing myself walking out on my job. Getting kicked out of my apartment. Living in my car. That being repossessed. And eventually ending up in a gutter, wrapped in a a blanket but still freezing to death. Just frozen. Not moving, not willing and thus not physically able to bring myself to it. There is no point to it. It is never enough. Not matter how much you work, how hard you try, it doe not work. I do not get ahead. Everything I am, someone is better at it. And anything I do, I can be replaced. And if I do find success by some small measure, I acclimate and find myself just a miserable. Nothing ha changed. I did a long big post a few week ago about all the supposed progress I made. It doe not bring me happiness anymore. I am so fucking far behind I will never get to a place where I feel safe, so fuck it. I just want to exit. I am sick of being a cog in a machine I never wanted to help built or run. Life is just work, sleep, and distract. I am not sure why I am writing it. I do not know how I found the motivation.",0.36041999999999996

"Well, a little update then. For those who do not know me that well yet, which is everybody I suppose I am the almost year old that chose to take a break from school, due to pff what will it be? Anxiety, depression, health problem regarding sleep energy. I tried it again at some point, but after week found myself to be, not cured yet. I figured it had to end, so I went looking for help. Social worker, well that is all nice and stuff, but not too helpful. Then the official psychiatrists. Well let is pick up from there the first one, in the Adolescents department directed me to another shrink after the first intake meeting, my help question not sure. But something wa keeping me from being able to fit in the system. I also had concentration problem but she did not want to dig into that. So this new shrink, on a different department, made me fill in some form and we had some talk and well, apparently the concentration problem IS a big issue and causing a lot of damage a well a my past divorced parents, being bullied all my life etc etc. Okay fine, so I say maybe I need something to help me sleep? And she suggested I go see my house doctor and ask for sleeping medicines. Which I got, and used for two week now and ..nothing. Well, the first day were good, the after that were le good, and I do not even remember the one after that. I woke up automatically, and sometimes sleep wa okay. But after week I am still SO tired everyday, it is killing me. I try and keep up a new rhythm, but it is so exhausting and I feel like doing all sort of happy thing but I just do not have the energy and then I go do it anyway and I end up so hurt and tired. Now, I cannot take the medicine for more than two weeks, so today wa going to be my last. Well, I sort of should have read the booklet I got with it before use. It said I should not take them EVERY day but every other day, and like I do not know, it say it build up and stay in your body. Well, I am fine do not worry. They warned about some side effects, but I seem to have been okay. However, the side effect include ALL the thing I already suffered from BEFORE even taking the darn medicines!! So it is been a complete and utter waste. This one day, I tried sleeping without medicines, and I just could not..just, cannot fall asleep. So yeah, I had that talk with yet another shrink today, and now he want me to see some other person. And he think I SHOULDN T take sleeping medicines. So like, ARGH, people keep telling me opposite things, and now they want me to see this person, who will help me fill in my day and get organized?? That is all cool and well and all, but I got there myself already. I figured it all out before I even started seeing these professional and now they are telling me what I already came up with on my own?? It is another week wait. And I do not know anymore. I am confused about all this, and beginning to think it is been a huge mistake in the first place. And now that it is Spring again, I am feeling sort of happy. So depression is still here, but, I do not notice it much..or do I? I am still feeling so alone and my family still doe not get me..I just want out, I just want to be away from here, which brings u back to the original problem. I am so annoyed, and after this, today is just going to be another day that I just do not do anything useful.. Sure I want to go back to school, but it take time..I have some time, then again I do not.. I had so many plans, and ARGH this sleeping problem, which is going to be my main focus now, is just so darn annoying. I could listen to countless piece of advice, but in the end, it is just no good to me.. Even the stupid sleeping medicine do not work..And every time I go see a shrink about one problem, they point me to someone else, and then another problem bother me and they send me back but that still did not fix my first problem. I am like, fine I will go fix this darn problem myself then. I really feel like cursing, but I will not because it is not proper so I will release some rage when I am done here, but just know that I am really upset and annoyed . After all, it wa me who had to fix everything all my life right? So I might a well start now.. haha such a laugh, I will procrastinate till the day I die.. So very tired. I cannot do a thing.. ugh, I am so sick of it. I want to go sleep now, but I just know I will wake up late in the evening and will not be able to sleep tonight. Such a drag.. too young to be broken already..",0.26076
"Law of Attraction is bullshit. Also hard work doe not pay off. Everything in life is based on chance and luck only. Our society preaches the fiction of hard work paying off because we need most expandable people to work hard, so that the rest can just chill and live off their backs. Also every fucking motivational coach and self-help guide is a fucking scam. Focusing your goals, working hard and putting effort in to achieve them? Yeah, tell that to people with terminal disease or people living in poverty without the chance to ever get better, people dying of famine or living in war zones. Tell that to the legion of people who did not make the cut and never will. Yeah, tell them they just did not work hard enough , did not want it enough while you completely ignore how fucking lucky you got to be in the privileged position you are in.

"I always wanted to go to the therapy but my very huge and overprotective gossip-loving family made this impossible for me to do Not only that but even a little hypothetical talk about it would instantly gain unnecessary panic like attention and after several phone call to friends, family member with something like Hey Clara, he want to go to the therapist. Is this normal? Which one should we call? Do you know anyone? Ask John please! And next day there will be several people touching my hand and saying Hey are you fine? Making it feel like something is wrong with me when I just want to talk to a professional in person without feeling like a babe. How do I know? Because my sister wa depressed once and I have seen how everyone reacted to it. You see, my family is never changing mentality is we need to fight together! We are there for you goddamn Fairy Tail guild or something . I do not blame them and I bet there are people who would exchange everything only to be with someone a supportive. But I have always hated attention so much since I remember my self a a kid. Ironically enough I have had the biggest birthday party in the town to boost this weird hate. Doing it secretly will be risky because I actually work in my family is business a well so my tight schedule and the fact that my town is pretty small make this almost impossible. And if someone find out I secretly go to talk to a doctor it will have even worse reaction than just straight out telling them. Maybe I am overreacting and have too much pride in me or no ball to admit to my family but sometimes I wish I could get invisible for just a week to sort my inner problem out. Sorry If this feel like I am trying to make it harder for you guy to make some suggestions. It is way more complicated than that I just wanted to let it out. I have read some post here and some of them were so so dark that my problem actually fade away a bit and I felt better because I said to my self yo.. you are being a bitch right now, look at these people suffering here, you are not even close! do not know if I am being terrible for healing my little wound by reading how other people suffer . Anyways, Idk why I have not visited this sub earlier, a I type these last word I already feel better because it is the first time I am doing something like this. Feels like I have talked to someone.

"Journal Entry - AM Monday, December th, Just thought I would share my thought from last night. I occasionally lurk Reddit looking for a relatable story, so I figured I would share some of my own thoughts. I do not want a job. The hardest part of having a job is talking. It is bad enough that I have to make eye contact. Having to speak on top of that can be nerve wrecking. Meeting new people is also tough. It is even tougher when you are the new one. Who are these people? Do I even want to know you? Are you going to try and get to know me? Am I going to allow it? Customers are easier to deal with, but just a drag to have to deal with. It can be monotonous. Often, it is annoying. But all the while, I just feel drained. There are good day at work. But there are also bad days. And those bad day make the lasting impression, in my experience. I am thankful for those good days. But the bad day remind me that I want better for myself. I am tired of working in restaurants. I am tired of wearing a stupid hat my hair can barely fit under. I am tired of repeating phrase I am told to repeat. I am tired of seeing the disgusting process of how people is shitty food is prepared. I am tired of cooking, something I enjoy, feeling soulless. Historically, preparing a meal and feeding someone is a virtuous act, at least to me. The commoditization of it is a bit of a shame. I detest consumerism, generally speaking. Customers are not my favorite people. Along with restaurants, I hope to avoid customer interaction at my next job. I really do not want any job. When it come to time amp energy vs. money, I am all for the money until I find out what I have to do. Then my my time amp energy feel more valuable. Because it is more valuable.",0.26013000000000003
My roommate asked me move. My car died. And I put myself in the hospital. Girlfriend is over it and want me to get my life together. With out without her. She doe not want to be around me. I am ubering to my job at the moment. I just basically shut down at the start of sundown. Shut down and drank for or day with the last one with me on the phone with a rope on my neck. I feel absolutely help less. Do not have money to pay rent. Do not have enough money to Uber to work. My next logical step is to move back to my mother is. Which is not only depressing. She is just minute from everything. I am not even thinking suicide. I am just thinking like life pretty much ha a depressed shade over it. Probably from me recovering from withdrawal. I do not want to move back to my mom is. To sit there away from everything I want to do. And now I gotta start over. Fuck this is why I drank. the panick begin to consume me.,0.28655
"I feel like I am lazy I feel like I am lazy because I have no will, desire, or energy to work. Sometimes I do not even want to walk.. and I am tired pretty much always.

I cannot keep a job because I simply cannot force my brain to do the work or I have to miss because I am sick.. which really is just anxiety I am sure.

I am not sure if trigger warning are common place here, but before you read on I would like to say warn that this mention suicide.

I am struggling to keep it all together. I just want to cry all day. But I do not want my kid to see my crying. Everyone around me is just carrying on like normal. I have a history of depression, I am currently in therapy and on medication. I feel like my family is wrapping me in cotton wool. When I first found out how it happened, I obsessed over article that described the process they would have went through while dying. I kept wondering what they were feeling in that moment.. if during those last moment they had regret. Then I kept tormenting myself with the what if? I have been able to stop doing those. But now.. I just want to be a sloth. I want to sit on the couch and watch TV all day. All motivation I had prior to last week ha just gone. I have never had anyone this close to me die. A friend who I had grown apart from committed suicide last year. I wa upset,.. but I wa not this upset. Let me stress this - I am definitely not having any suicidal thoughts.

I blame my lack of success on myself. I do not enjoy thing a much a I used to so I have no real hobbies. I do not think I am likable and I cannot even pas interview these days. I lost my personality and that is why I hate myself. I am unrecognisable to who I used to be so I isolate myself a lot more these days. I do not think significantly depressed but I wonder if mild depression is the cause of my loss of personality? Or could it be something else that caused me to change? All I know is I have lost a lot of confidence and I am always beating myself up about it,0.5078900000000001
"I would like to say hello to everyone, I have bipolar and wa doing a bit of research into my illness, which I have not done before a I have always denied having the illness.

New life spending load of money racing up the career ladder on a High I meet this fantastic girl. We went on holiday together had some great times. After a year or two I moved in with this girl gave up my good job and planned a future for u both marriage extra. There wa one thing holding u back we both hard bipolar and never told each other about or illness a we thought this could change everything. As you can imagine if she when on a high I went on a low , and when I went on a high starting company and buying thing I could not afford she would go on a low. Our relationship did not last for much longer a she would self harm and I would attempt suicide. It wa not until I went into hospital that it all came out in the open. We are still friend but both agree that two bipolar people do not match. My doctor did smile and we did laugh about it. Anyway I am new and just want to say hi to everyone.",0.0
"I am so very angry. It is eating me up. I am sick of it. It is not healthy. It cost me a lot. Yet even this make me angry! rrARGG! I feel like the female version of the Hulk. Do you know how it feel to go through the cycle of feeling nut alone to gaining a semblance of normalcy? Well, that make me angry. I get angry when I start to get happy. I get angry when I start to feel sad. I get angry when someone show me love. I get angry when thing go well. I get angry when thing do not go well. I get angry, I get angry, I get angry. This weekend I had this clear clear vision. I wa immediately present for the first time in a long time. I felt, I breathed, I listened, I laughed. I saw. And I got very very angry. I do not belong where I am. I do not belong. I screwed up, I fell asleep, I got depressed and now Look at all that ha changed! Nothing is the same and I feel like I have traveled through a million mile of time in one short weekend. This is all too much. Who the hell am I? How did I get here? What am I going to do now? Shit!! All this time I believed I could do it alone. All this time I tried to be strong. All this time I tried to put others before myself no matter what the cost. Now I am alone. I am like a ghost of myself. When I speak, what come out is all wrong. I am nothing like I used to be. I am scared, I am torn, and I am alone. My old friend look to me you are so great. You are here for me and you are strong. Blah blah blah .. in reality we are just too lost soul traveling the highway alone. If I see you, I see you. But you are not going be there for my funeral. You will probably not even know when and where it is. You will sleep through it and read about in the newspaper or some shit. You will cry to the person next to you, and that will be that. Family look at me and say oh we love you so much. You are so strong and what? Are you going through creative or man pain again? Gee, I love you too. But you are not the answer. WE are just traveling the highway alone. You keep looking for the answer. I know there are not no answer. We are alone wine song and comforting arm and all. I am angry because I know this journey is mine and I am not doing so hot. I get disorientated, I get distracted, I screw up. And you know what?! That is ok. thanks I needed a good angry rant Maybe there is someone out there who doe not find this completely insane. If I do not speak it, it will stay inside and explode in some other form.",0.0

"this is my first post , so bare with me. I have been married a year and just found out some interesting news about my husband. He told me that the man he call dad is not really his father. He told me that his mother never told him until he wa year old, and had to go to court to change his name. I always wondered why, he and his father never got along. His mother will not tell him who his real father is. I feel I need to help him find him, so he can close the door, and get answer to all his questions. My husband doe not like to talk about feelings, he wa raised in a family where no one talked about feeling and if you had a problem you kept it to yourself. I wa raised totally opposite. In way this ha left him hurt and confused. He feel like he doe not belong sometimes. He told me sometimes he would like to know who his dad is and other time he could care less. But, it seems like it is always on his mind, when family issue come about. The man that raised him, is an issue all to his own, he is very abusive, physically, and mentally. He is always telling my husband, he is wrong and will never be able to be successful. He ha heard that all his life, but he ha never believed it - he is strong and ha a good heart - It just hurt me when I see him lash out. He take all his problem out on me, I now understand why. I have not told him, but I found out who his father is. All I have is a name. I want to tell him but do not know if I should. I do not want his mother not to talk to him if he know - I am very confused - I am right in the middle and do not want anyone to get hurt.

I am also raising my little brother, who is . I have suffered from anxiety attack since I wa and became seriously depressed about year ago. I wa hospitalized once .. when the doctor put me on Zoloft. Since then I have tried Effexor XR and Klonopin worked for month and am supposed to be trying Wellbutrin and Buspar now scared to start them . I self - harm when thing get too hard for me, and have scar covering much of my left arm due to cutting. I wa recently dismissed from my therapy psychiatrist due to missed appointment .. and I do not know if I am going to find another one yet. I think about just letting go sometimes. Nothing really help anyways. The one thing that depresses me the most is my fear of spending the rest of my life alone. Men seem to think I am only good for one thing .. and I guess I agree. I hate that I go from being okay .. sometimes for week at a time .. and then everything fall apart. My family support me .. sometimes. At least, my mom let me crash at her house when thing are real bad. My mom and my sister try to be there .. but they get tired of me. I cannot say I had a bad childhood .. I cannot remember my childhood. I went under hypnosis .. had a vision of my dad and became extremely afraid. I never had a chance to go back and find out why. Missed too many appointments. My dad wa accused of being abusive to my mother and having a violent temper .. and of molesting my sister and I. Do not remember. My dad say my mom left u for two year when I wa or year old and wa always drunk. Do not remember. I spent much of my teen year drunk high and being promiscuous .. let is just say even my mother knew I had a reputation. Why? Do not know. I have never felt like I belonged .. and the past few year I have felt like I have not really been living. Disassociation, I suppose. I am usually moody, never have any energy, and have started and quit school time to date. Never accomplished anything but getting my GED .. and the sad thing is .. I am smart. I live day to day .. never knowing if it will be a good day or a bad day. My daughter had missed a lot of school because I cannot seem to get her there by in the afternoon. My mom say she will help .. but I know I am on my own. Neither of my daughter father is are any help. My dad left my little brother with me in November, sends down some money every month.. and ha not seen him since. Some day I feel like I am on top of thing .. most day I feel like thing are on top of me .. and smothering me. I have started writing my daughter a letter letting them know everything I want them to know when they are older .. just in case I am not around. I cannot say for sure this will not beat me one day, and I want to be prepared. I love my kid .. but also believe with all my heart they would be better off without me. Sure .. they love me and I am their mommy .. but not all mommy are good mommy and not all mommy deserve to raise children. Love is not always enough .. because God is he even real? know I would die kill for my girls. I know the answer to nothing and have so many questions. This is my life .. Scared to be alone .. but I always am. I read this somewhere and it sum up how I feel I am not hungry .. but I am starving. I am not tired .. but I am exhausted. I am not bleeding .. but I am dying.

Yes I have a supportive family and yes I have friend that are willing to listen to my bullshit, but dose that really lessen my inner turmoil and trouble with my mind, so I have to be fucking stabbed by my own brother to make it legit ? Yes I know nobody liked school, but did they all make themselves believe it wa school or nothing, and when they ended up at a dead and wa convinced that there life wa over !? Did all kid struggle with basic in school ?! Did every kid end up feeling alone no Mather what he or she did there entire life ?! Did they have to feel so alone and unconnected ?!

"For the first time in my life i liked this girl and when she left life around me doe not make sense. Why doe this pain happen to people This is my first time and please i need some answer on what to do, why doe life work this way, i fucking hate that thing had to go wrong this fucking way. My depression is taking over me and my family is worried about me. For the first time in high school i liked this girl for about month and during that time we became best friend and i always thought she would like me if i cared for her and treated her right. i always acted the same way a her and found out we thought the same sometimes. We always talked to each other including late night till or am and we knew everything about each other and we always were with each other but instead she liked some asshole who did not like me and always kept lying about me to her. She never believed what he said about me but chose to love him and be with him more and they always were with each other after class and it made me jealous and angry on why she would do this. One day i invited her to some place with her and my friend but she decided to also want to take the asshole and i got frustrated and ended our friendship. she got angry at me and decided to leave too. but one day the asshole decided to leave her because of a fight they had and she start cry to me on the phone and i try to help her get over him but it hurt me when she say she love this person who kept lying to her about me and other thing and he wa known to be a bad person and she only dated one guy before but he wa super nice and i did not understand why she liked him and she said she did not either, it wa only that she felt happy around him. She is such a pretty girl and most of the guy in the school agree and thought me and her were dating but they never knew she really liked this asshole and during the time they hanged out she kept asking me if they were right for each other and she said she would separate from him but she did not listen to me. Instead they got closer and me and this asshole got into more fight with each other but she would rather not say anything and still be with him. Now she is actually separating from him after all this time. Why did she do this to me after everything we have been through because i treated her way better but she did this to me and i dont know should i go back to her after what she did. Its been week and i have not talked to her since then and my mind ha been thinking of way to beat myself up because of this problem. Everyone know im depressed but at this point i could not care and im losing my mind and i just need some answer of why she liked this asshole but not me.",0.3237

"Hi, I am Ellen a.k.a. Froggie girl, a -year-old female who ha been depressed for life. I have been labeled a having dysthymia in the past. Although it wa never officially shared with me, I believe from what I have read that I wa depressed even a a child. I graduated college the first time in with a BA in Sociology with Medical Emphasis and have worked in the medical transcription field for years. I have become bored with the job and dissatisfied with being forced to work from home. Majorly boring! Last year I started going back to school to pursue a Masters in Fine Arts in Graphic Design. This ha been a huge challenge since I am brand new in the art field and most of the other student are already artists. In addition, I MUST work hour a week to maintain my health insurance benefits. My mom ha been my best friend and support person forever and now she ha been diagnosed with lung cancer. She had surgery month ago and just began chemotherapy last week. I have had an awful time dealing with this. Although she ha been given a fairly decent prognosis, I am scared that she is going to leave me and would trade place with her in flash if I could. Truthfully I am disappointed every day when I wake up. I save lot of money on product to remove mascara, a the tear usually do the job. I had been on Zoloft mg since the late s and my family doctor increased it first to and now to mg. I have also started seeing a psychiatrist, only session so far, so hard to say much about that.

"I promised I would post regarding what I perceived to be a meltdown. As previously posted, I told all y all that I would been taking Neurontin. Since it wa not prescribed for seizure but for sleep, insurance would no longer cover it because they said it did not fit into the category of antidepressant or psychotropics, and so on and so forth. All red tape. So, the Neurontin wa stopped, through no fault of my own. Well, this disturbed my therapist. So, after almost week off of the Neurontin, during which each week I seemed to be going more off the deep end. Meaning, I could not sleep, eat, had the shakes, horrific mood swings, unable to think positive about myself, and piggyback panic attack and I subsequently wa going off on some cry gig, etc. So, on the nd when I saw my doctor she said with everything I wa describing, that indeed I wa having withdrawals. Like Duh, I already knew that. It seems the combination of the med I wa on wa balancing me out and the mere change in the medicine did in fact change the way the other med worked, or did not work. Since I am so hypersensitive to just about every medication, it took forever to find the right medication and dosage to keep me on the straight and narrow the doctor said she would like for me to go back to the psychiatrist that originally prescribed the medication and see if they would try another antidepressant. Another one? That did not set well with me and I guess I wa at the end of my rope. I broke down and ended up staying at the doctor is office for almost two hour while they had to give me a pill to calm me down. I felt so vulnerable and of course in my state of mind I perceived this a another crisis. I also felt extremely istupid for breaking down that way. That is why I said I had a meltdown. There wa not much I could physically do on Thursday, but, I knew I had to come back to earth. After calming down, thanks to their cocktail pill , which I did not ask it name. I agreed to see the psychiatrist. What choice did I have. I think the cry episode happened because I remembered all the bad event that happened while they were trying to find the right med that would balance me out. It is scary. Of course while I wa at the doctor is, I kept asking stupid question like, why do I have to be on anything? Is that denial or what? So, to cut this short. I will be going to the psychiatrist a soon a they can fit me in. But I need some help. I am asking any of my friend here to give me any input you want. I have been doing pretty good the last couple of day doing the cognitive thinking and just staying busy. It is the down time that is unsettling. And obviously, if you see the time this is being posted, you know I am not sleeping much. I am thinking positive. My doctor called me Friday to check on me. That wa surprising. A doctor really calling back. So, seeing how she is my new doctor, maybe we will be compatible after all. Thanks for taking the time to read this and for anything you would like to add to help.

"I am new to any kind of discussion like this. I am new to any kind of support like this. I go to Therapy once a week, or rather I did, but it wa not really making a large difference. I am going to be twentytwo soon, and my life is nowhere how I wish it to be. The funny part is that to get it where I would like it all I would have to do is go out and get a job, start working. I just cannot seem to leave the house. I am not a shut in, or anything. I love people. I try and keep friend with everything, but I get self - conscious all the time. My early life wa pretty difficult when it came to that, getting bullied badly for wearing glass and being a bit of a dork. I never really learned those little social rule that everyone else did. Sometimes I just feel like I am not on everyone is page, and nothing seems to help. I became a father at nineteen, and it wa difficult. I loved my girlfriend very much at the time, and dropped out of school to support her and our daughter. I love my daughter, she is everything. My girlfriend left me for another man when our daughter wa four week old, I cannot help but feel insecure about this. Logically I should know she is just not so bright or genuine a person with me, but I cannot help but feel part of it wa me. She stopped letting me see my daughter a short time after, I had to go to court and battle thing out. The only accomplishment I have made in the last year that I could feel proud about wa to get partial custody and three day a week with her. I am attentive and loving father. I have a great relationship with my little girl. But I cannot feel good about it. Sometimes it is like, a soon a she is gone, I forget she wa even here. I spend all day in the house, like a zombie. I am either on the computer or at the TV, watching baseball. I know I want to have a healthy and happy life, and I want to have money and security for my daughter, but I cannot motivate myself to do anything. My parent were never attentive, and fight constantly, but I am twentyone and should be over that. Instead, it make me more down now than it ever has. I am like a giant pit of negativity all the time. I wa involved with a girl, but that faded quick, and just like everything else it brought me down. I do not do drugs, or drink, but sometimes I really want to. Funny part is that I have never felt any kind of relief doing them in the past. In fact, usually my insecurity and negativity are worse. I feel like I need to get moving soon, or I will never get moving. I tried killing myself after my girlfriend stopped letting me see my daughter, I know how bad that wa for me. I know how I made others feel, and I know how miserable I was. I do not ever want to get that way again. But for some reason, and I just do not understand, I cannot get myself to get moving.",0.0
My parent only having expectation for me to succeed just make me feel like the biggest failure of my brothers. Which not only is bullshit but also make me just not try in the first place a lot of the time. Because if I try and fail it worse because I am expected to succeed. I do not even understand why they expect me to be the successful one. I barely got acceptable grade in high school until senior year when I just took easy courses. I failed English and nearly failed Spanish in th grade because I wa too lazy to put in any effort. I barely ever brought home friend or did extracurricular activity most of high school. But for some reason I am their grand vision for who is gonna make the family proud.,0.23743000000000003

Ending my life if I turn Things around me had become le interesting. I have become so bored to the point I just do not wanna live anymore. I want to change but I realized I am just being a hypocrite so I am ending it. I did not learn to love myself nor anyone. I asked advice from acquaintance but their advice are all the same and day by day I have become more depressed and I did not tell anyone about it anymore because what is the point? I wanted to live for my family but thinking I am dealing with my mental illness alone is hurting me and it just too much.. Should I really end it?,0.33304

"I tried to get onto the chat room, but it will not let me so I will just post my question here. In my sociology class today my professor wa talking about an experiment where several pseudomanic healthy patient checked into mental hospital to record the results. The detail of the experiment are not important, but what I wa wondering wa about how my teacher said that the patient used fake name so that it would not be on their permanent record and so that they would not be labeled a crazy . So I raised my hand and asked who would be labeling them and why they could not use their real names, like how would people know? He said that it would be on their record and that if people wanted to find out if they have ever been hospitalized they could, particularly employers. Kind of like if you wanted to inquire about a rapist living in your town, is what he said. I wanted to ask more but did not want to press it. So my question are, what kind of record doe this go on? Your hospital record? Your police record? When employer do a background check, doe this show up? Then I wa wondering, when police pull you over for speeding or something and they check your information on their computer, what come up? Everything? If they were involved in an ambulance taking someone into the hospital, do they have that on file? Is there any way to see what is on your file? I am just a little paranoid now about if there are going to be limitation in life now a to what I can do because of my record. Or if anyone know how I would be able to find out this information that would be great,",0.20462

"I have severe anxiety and suicidal ideation I have no motivation to do anything. If i dont go to work im in bed all day. I have no desire to text friend or do thing i used to be passionate about. All i can think about is how much of a loser i am because i have not applied to any college yet i graduated in may . I see on social medium people going out and having fun and i look at myself, im never out of bed. The only time i shower is when i go to work or go run errand with my mom. I am physically and mentally exhausted. Another thing, I have severe anxiety about posting on social media. Ill muster the courage to post a selfie and then delete an hour later. When i have panic attack i delete my profile picture, bio and everything i posted that is a picture of me or i think people will judge me for. I keep thinking that my friend are just talking about me behind my back and actually hate me. These thought get so overwhelming that i start picking at my skin where i think there is something wrong about it and pulling my hair out. I keep cutting my hair, too. Its only two inch and it used to be down to my elbow. I keep thinking it will be all over if i just walk outside onto the freeway or swallow some pills.

"Really struggling with self image - any tip to build self confidence? I have struggled with my overall view of myself for a long a I can remember - in particular with my weight. Where im at, at the moment feel like the worst it ever been, I keep having full blown melt down about how much I repulse myself. Throughout my life Ive been on more diet than I can count and tried multiple different excercise routines. About year ago I gained kg really fast and after moping and feeling sorry for myself i decided i would kick it up a notch and started taking thing really serious. day a week at the gym, personal training, strict meal plan - the works. This worked so well at the beginning, I dropped kg in the first few months. It came to a halt and for the past year I have continued to lose weight slower - im at about kilo down in total now. I thought I would be further along by now. I live and work on the road at the moment travelling from town to town so ive dropped the gym membership but I try and make up for it with doing workout session on my own, lot of hiking and swimming. I recently switched to a keto diet from the previous meal plan I wa on. I am fitter than I have ever been and what I can achieve now in a physical capacity is so much greater than ever before in my life I wa le fit even a a child The problem I have is that im still so overweight, I very rarely find anything that fit me in store and i dont have an address to order thing online. I feel like people could look at me and assume I dont give a fuck about my health when I do and that make me feel worse. Anytime I talk to doctor about unrelated issue they make it about my weight. I feel like outwardly im the worst version of myself, I look in the mirror and get angry. Does anyone have any tip on how to pull myself out of this? I feel so crushed when I am reminded of my weight because I dont feel how I look. I want to be proud of my achievement but I am not, I feel annoyed that it not better and I havent reached a bigger goal. I think ill never reach a weight I am happy with - which is not only devastating to me but bother me so much more because im genuinely trying my hardest. Ive had hiccup and time where I have literally tried to eat my feeling away but I always pick myself up and try again. I dont know how many more time I can fail. In an effort to help me stay on track my partner started eating the same food a me. Weightloss had never been his goal or something he wa focusing on, it wa just to make it easier on me not to see him eating a toasted cheese sandwich while I wa eating salad with no dressing. He wanted to limit the temptation and helped cook me awesome healthy meal that tasted a million time better than anything I cooked. For him it worked a treat, he wa never overweight just a bit stocky, but he since lost so much weight and look amazing. And whilst im so happy for him it hurt a it just show how much progress i havent made. As stupid a it sound I think it highlight my weight more when we are together cause he look so fit and healthy and I look like I sit around eating kfc all day.

"I do not know what my problem is Hello, I have never posted here before. I am a year old guy and have a decent job that I like, it is quiet and involves a lot of puzzle solving and I am pretty good at it. I have never had a ton of friend because I am very particular and not very open with people so it take a long time to build up relationships, but the friend I do have are outstanding and I would not trade them for anything. I am kind of the funny guy but my humor is very blue. I got bullied a lot in grade school and learned to make people laugh because it would get them to not make fun of me. I think it just kind of stuck. I do not know if any of that information is really important, just wanted to give it in case that is something that people do here. For at least years, I have a hard time doing anything outside of my job alone without crawling up inside my head. All the thing that I used to do for enjoyment like listening to music or playing video games, I just cannot do anything anymore. It is like a wave of apathy that very rarely lifts. Occasionally, I pick up a razor blade and will press it into my shoulder or hand and I do not really know why to be honest. I do not know if I like the pain or maybe I like having something else to focus on for a minute. Or just to feel something that is not apathy for a moment. I think about dying sometimes. Why we are here, what is the point if it end the same. I doubt I would ever kill myself because there are thing I care about here that I would not leave behind like that, mainly my mom and brother. I worry my brother will end up like me. Is there anything I can do? I do not know what a pill could do for me or if a pill works. I think the brain is so complex that it could not, but I guess I do not know. I do not want to be in a mental fog or be unaware or not be me anymore. I have also always kind of thought that it is human nature to feel this way that everybody get down, get bored, think about their mortality, etc. and that I am just being soft and need to suck it up. Life is difficult, I just need to learn to deal with it maybe. I do not know what is going on but I do not like feeling like that. If I am hanging out with friend or family I am usually fine, it is being alone with myself and having time alone where I cannot entertain myself and waste away. I cannot really explain it. Does anyone else feel like this? What help you? I have never talked to a therapist or anything like that and understand you cannot give a diagnosis on here, but if you know any method to help me get out of that feeling, I would be eternally grateful. Is this what depression feel like and I have just been in denial about having it for years?",0.23214
Why doe depression do this It is destroyed my ability to properly feel love or empathy with those closest to me. It is driving me insane and making me feel like I do not care about them anymore.

"I want to die trigger warning Trigger Warning My trauma happened when i wa , I am now and still suffer from it daily. I actually suppressed the trauma completely until I wa , when it all came back to me so I guess I have only really been dealing with it for year now. I have severe PTSD, severe depression, anxiety, severe panic anxiety attacks, OCD, severe memory loss, and had an intense eating disorder for year that I am still struggling with constantly. I have not gotten a good night sleep in years. I have constant PTSD nightmares, regular nightmares, and insomnia constant fatigue and exhaustion. I also disassociate a lot and self harmed for years. Currently clean from self harm for about a year and a half. I have been admitted to a hospital because of all of my mental problems, and honestly wish I could go back sometimes. I wa gaslighted for year to believe that my trauma wa normal. My home environment wa constantly hostile. I go through long period of feeling suicidal. Currently in that period. Do not know what to do, honestly. Years of being in therapy and being prescribed pill and yet I still am nowhere near being close to healthy. Looking back, I cannot even remember the last time I wa genuinely happy. The period of my sadness last longer than my period of calm. I am so afraid of waking up when I am and still feeling the same way I do now. The thing about being an adult that spent their entire teenage year thinking they would have killed themselves by now is realizing that your mental illness have real repercussions. I have fucked bone and a fucked stomach because of an eating disorder that lasted so long and a GED because I couldnt find the will to do schoolwork when I wa just trying to find the will to live another day and not cut myself again. I cannot afford college because I did not do any extracurriculars to get scholarship because the thought of having to stay after school made me want to have a panic attack and i just wanted to sleep. I have no friend because when people invited me to hang out my anxiety made me cry myself to sleep instead. I did not have any real thought-out grand plan because I wa too busy hurting myself and getting high and wanting to kill myself to really sit down and plan thing out. I said I wanted to do thing but never took the time to think it all through.

It doesnt seem fair that I am suffering so much still. I do not know what to do anymore. I am tired of trying so fucking hard. I know this is self-pitying and emo but I just do not know what to do.

"Escapism and depression Sorry about the self-pity rant that is inbound, needed to get this out there somehow. This morning I wa taking a shower sitting down with the light off - I know, pretty edgy behavior, but it is my way of unwinding and resetting myself between bout of work. I finished up a relatively escapist story the night prior. Stupidly, I had allowed myself to suspend my disbelief and got sucked into the plot. The writing wa not even terribly good - the only reason I enjoyed myself wa because I could temporarily forget my current self and take up the role of some other more relevant and admirable character. The story ended with a shoehorned but unbearably happy ending where the main character get married, settle in with his newfound friends, and all is good for the time being. You know, the typical insert generic ending here bullshit. Fast forward to this morning. I am in the shower and start thinking of my day to come, making mental to-do lists, and stressing about my current temporary problems. But somewhere along the line, I start thinking of the stupid story. I cannot help but start comparing my life with that of the main character and think about how much I would give just to be able to live a more meaningful, le real life. Then I start comparing myself to the character, and realize just how useless I am. Like holy shit, I am almost an adult and am still a passionless idiot who doe nothing outside of schoolwork. Of course I cannot lead a meaningful life, I am not worthy of any of it. Thinking about this evidently stressed me out a bit too much, a I started puking what little I ate all over my shower floor and crying. I do not know. I enjoy escapism probably to a fault, but it is the only way for me to feel at least a little relevant. I will probably come to term with my role a human being ,, someday.

"It is been so long since I have been here doubt anyone would remember me! Lots ha been happening. My job ha become busier so I have become more exhausted when I get home and I just do not want to do anything. Then on March my brother from my adopted mother died of a heart attack so had to go through that experience with my niece, his only daughter. Then right after that my husband got really sick with pain in his belly. We took him into emergency and they did a CT scan and could see only massive infection and could not tell where it wa coming from. So he wa admitted and given antibiotic and scheduled for a colonoscopy. He wa also very low on potassium so he wa given bag of potassium and taking pill on top of that. His colon wa clear so it wa determined his gall bladder wa diseased and needed to come out. But right now it wa so swollen and infected the surgeon wanted to wait until the infection cleared and swelling went down before he took it out. So husband is now on a non-fat diet to reduce the swelling and still on antibiotic to clear out the infection. Fortunately, being vegan, non - fat is not too hard for u to do. He go in for a pre - exam on Wednesday and then surgery a week later. But through all this I have not been doing my routing of medication and exercise and am suffering for it. Fibro and migraine have hit me really hard. I am still trying to take care of my husband though by preparing his meals. He lost almost lb through the last week of this whole episode. In the meantime, I have an appointment Monday with a neurosurgeon to discus if something need to be done with my tethered spinal cord. I have had it for year and it cause weakness in my leg and pin and needle in my feet. It could also affect bladder and bowel function but I have not had that problem yet. I have read that sometimes they cut the end of the spinal cord to get it out of the way of the vertebrae. I am not sure how serious my case is but my neurologist thought it wa serious enough to send me to surgeons. It is a rare birth defect I guess found in adults. Usually they catch it in infants.

I have my roommates, but I do not really talk to them much and they all have girlfriend that they hang out with all the time anyway. Even the one I went to high school with.

We never make a big as meal together on Saturday anymore. Honestly, I do not think they would even want to go anyway. There is no one else I would ask. Everyone at work is either dating someone or I do not know them well enough. I am taking online class so no one there either. I do not do anything outside of school or work.

"I have been depressed all my life and I am just tired I am finding it harder and harder everyday. I am almost year old and I cannot even function properly. I feel like I have the mental capacity of a child sometimes because I do not know how to do anything. My entire life I lived in fear of my parent and now that I am out I just cannot function at all. I had to quit my job because I could not handle being at work in my emotional state. I cannot handle people being vaguely negative towards me. I feel awful because now it is just my fianc working, but he say that it is okay that I need time.. I cannot help but feel he resents me for it. I do not even know how we are going to pay for our wedding. I do not know anything about feminine hygiene, or how to brush style my hair. It is just matted in knot and up in a bun, or if it look decent enough I will put it in a ponytail. I do not know how to keep friend because I wa constantly grounded for everything. I spent most of my life alone in my room, when I wa grounded I wa not allowed to eat dinner with the family. I have step sisters, one half sister, and half brothers. All from different marriage not including my parent since I am their only child. And I am not close with any of them. I do not even know all of their ages. I did not have mother figure in my life because my stepmoms were just either physically abusive or emotionally. My dad wa a drunk, and just controlled every aspect of my life yelling at me if I did not want to do something or had different opinion than him you think you are in control of your life but you are not. You belong to me or make weird sexual remark in front of his friend when I would have a friend over oh you two girl are probably going to kiss and rollover on top of each other thankfully not in front of her. But sadly our friendship did not really last very long. Then he convinced me to get really drunk when I went to go visit from college and his friend tried taking advantage of me when I wa trying to sleep it off in my room. I want to get a better job than the one I had previously but my upkeep is awful and I probably would not get hired.. And I know I have to better myself but it is just so hard I just do not know where to start. I have no money. No friends. I practically have no family because I never want to go back. I dropped out of school because I could not afford it anymore because my dad stole the money I saved up. But even if he did not I probably still would have dropped out because I could not pick a major, I kept changing it, and I feel like a loser because I wa supposed to graduate this year. I used to be really good at math and writing and now I cannot even remember simple math or how to use proper grammar. I find myself not knowing how to spell word or using the wrong one and it just make me feel so stupid. I hate it. I wa diagnosed with BPD and I cannot even afford to treat it. My car stopped working, and I do not even know how to use a bus. I hate my life. I hate everything. I am just so tired of it all. I already went to a mental facility for a month and I still cannot function. I cannot bring myself to end it all because I love my fianc more than anything. He is been my one true friend since high school, even if we only spoke at school, he is always been there for me. I cannot leave him. I do not know what to do. I do not have clear thinking.

Lots of tears, lot of laugh. But i have never given up on myself Last November, my brother did sth bad. And my ex attempted suicide. That is when i got depressed again.

My situation with her is exactly like in the movie Before we go by Chris Evan. stranger meet each other out of billion people but they would never see each other again. And day after we met we hung out everyday for the last day , she is gone. We still keep contact but I dont think i would ever see her again please dont ask why . She know about depression. She made me make a promise to reach out to her every time i get depressed. The last day were the happiest day of my life. It feel like I actually live for the first time. But i also got depressed since. I got depressed because i could not recall her image. I couldnt recall her face. I could not recall what she looked like when we first met. And i couldnt remember why those were the happiest day of my life. I just recall those were the happiest. All i can recall is a brief moment of her smile for like - secs, her voice, and the moment when we were about to say good bye that i poured out my heart. Everything is so blurry. Then i went on to google to search for blurry memory and depression. And it lead me to depression and memory loss and depression and Alzheimer . Then i started to shed tears. I wa thinking about the day i actually lost my memories. What if it actually comes, What if one day i wouldnt remember her, my mom, my best friends, and even myself ? I wa teaching in class when i shed tears. I had to run to the bathroom and cried in there for mins. Luckily noone noticed. I remembered my promise to her. I wa about to text her.

I hate being in debt. I hate living where I live. That sort of thing. However, I am not unmotivated. Like at all. I am not hopeless. I am not suicidal in any way. I am terrified of death in fact one of my biggest fear is that I will get so depressed that I will become suicidal which is weird, I know but the point is, nothing in me want to die. That being said, I am tired all the time. I mean physically exhausted. Which seems to contradict major depression. I get up every day, shower every day, though I do not really want to go to work I go to work and do work with no issue it is more that I do not enjoy my job that much on most day honestly some day it is super fun it is just one of those thing it really ha to do with the fact that I am older and I am not doing what I thought I would be doing by this point in my life more than I hate my job . I cannot think of many reason why I would be this physically exhausted all the time. Literally every doctor say You you are just massively depressed . No, I do not believe I am depressed to the degree that it make me physically exhausted. If I still have plenty of hope for the future, want to get up, want to get dressed, want to shower, want to look good..how is this major depression to a point where I am also tired all the time? Is it possible to have some major depressive disorder and not be hopeless and still be motivated to work hard and try new things? Because if it is, someone need to tell me that. Any time a doctor tell me I must be depressed if I am so tired all the time and I tell them that I am not hopeless or suicidal or unmotivated then they go, Oh well I do not know what it is then . I am very annoyed with this because I never used to be physically exhausted like this before and doctor seem to just dismiss it a depression when I am positive my depression is not so bad it is ONLY making my physically exhausted and not having any other emotional affect on me. I am frustrated so, if anyone can answer this it would be helpful so I can see what avenue to pursue next. Note It is not a problem with my thyroid or adrenal gland I already had those checked twice by two different doctors.",0.44074
"Back pain ha brought me to a dark space. I have been struggling with back pain for year now and I am . I play soccer football , and thats all I know, I have played my whole life. I do not have much friend nor other hobby besides gaming very mediocre gamer . However, these pas two year have been terrible. Due to my undying love for the sport, I would try to play through the pain. regret it Which ha only made me worse. I decided my first Summer with back pain that I would not play for a month. Which I achieved with no real results. I passed the time playing Video games. However, the constant sitting probably made my back worse. I played a tournament that same Summer after the month break. game some sort of international tournament. By the end of the tournament my back had gotten so bad I could not bear to move. Despite all this, I somehow got chosen to go to Spain. Few month later I went to Spain at , with back pain, played soccer and such but did not get noticed. Fast forward to now and I have gone a whole season barley playing and still struggle with back pain. Now I am , I have gone this whole Summer without much activity just stretching and ab work outs. The Summer is almost over and the realization that I have not gotten better is bringing a dark cloud over me. I scream at night out of anger and sadness. I constantly tell myself I want to die lt -Im not sure if this is breaking a rule, sorry in advanced, just tell me and I will remove this part , and I cry everyday. I do most of those thing in private, when no one is home excluding the random screaming I do at night . I do not want my mom to worry about me like she doe my diagnosed depressed big brother, and also her dealing with my little brother is life He is . On top of all that my mom is a single mom and barley ha time for her own life and get sad easily. The sight of my mom sad deeply pain me inside I have always been the one kid that could take care of himself. She ha even told me personally that she is glad that she doe not need to worry too much about me only deal with my back pain, she take me to rehab . I have been to the Doctors and have done a MRI, they say it nothing. Just functional. Whatever that means.. Point is, I am very sad and I feel like I am getting worse everyday. I do not know what to do with my life. The one thing I wa good at is now gone. I do not have any other talent or interest.I feel empty without soccer and I do not know how to feel it. TL DR I have played soccer my whole life, got a back injury two year ago and I still have not healed. Doctors say it nothing As a result, I am very sad but I keep it to myself.

"ok, so today i had another freak out. I woke up feeling good .. it wa supposed to be my first therapy session which i and my boyfriend were happy about and then after this i wa supposed to meet up with my boyfriend for lunch, check my test marks, and then go to the library with my boyfriend to study. These plan changed.. When i walked into the therapy office, they said no appointment wa scheduled. All of a sudden i felt really rejected, not worthy of an appointment like they gave it to someone else , anxious, sick to my stomach, a little dizzy. I have been waiting since February for this appointment! I could not deal with my anger properly or the fact that my plan for therapy were ruined today. I started stuttering kind of i kind of got all dazed out and really sick when the receptionist wanted to schedule another appointment. So, it is tomorrow at am .. am!! What bastards. Anyway, so because i got all weird .. i did not want to be around people. I called my boyfriend .. could not get a hold of him. I cancelled .. did not check my marks, did not go to the library, or lunch or see my boyfriend. I left. I told my boyfriend i had bad anxiety. So, now he want a break. And I have been in my room since i got home since about pm .. feeling really low and weird and lightheaded .. I have been rocking a lot too on my rocking chair .. it is a weird compulsive soothing mechanism i have. Do not ask. I am mad at my boyfriend because he decided to take a break when i needed him most. Is this cold or what?! At the same time i understand he want his brain clear for exam studying. Whatever.

"This is how I feel and I have a slight sense I am the only one to think think this way. I am depressed? Help wanted I yearn for the day I wa in high school. I felt a if I wa always happy and never worried about anything. I am , just having graduated from University. It seems each day I am becoming a person who doe not want to have a relationship with anyone other then my family. I want to be alone. Happiness to me is being sheltered by reality--alone with my thoughts. I deleted every single bit of social medium I had about a year ago SC, FB, Insta, Twitter, etc in an attempt to become a alone a possible. I truly deep down wish I wa never born, but I would never ever commit suicide. I wish more then anything else that I can just disappear and leave this world. I am studying for the MCAT currently. I do not have any problem doing so because of my extremely addictive personality, but I find that I enjoy thing that take my mind off of reality. Studying, reading, listening to music or going for a drive are my favorite way to achieve this. But the reality I see is that this world is shit. I believe that a a whole, human are riddled with greed and selfishness that are the motivation behind MOST of everything in this world. And by humans, that obviously includes myself and I hate myself down to the core for the selfish thing I have done. Maybe I am too cynical or something. But this bad world syndrome fuck my brain and idk. I REEALLY question every aspect of life and I cannot help it. Each time I am left with question that completely make me hate the way this world is. I guess I can give one example. The most recent self-philosophical argument I had is the idea of wars, with murdering others specifically. We praise those who fight for our country, yet at the same time a great deal of these same people are super religious. Do people not evaluate the reality they are in? Do they not question why they believe the thing they do? Am I the only one? Does someone is act of ending another life provide justification for doing the same? Who is to even say so? If they would kill all of u if we did not kill them, then what make our life worth more? That is just one example, but then I look at area like American healthcare or the fact my family and others are wealthy while there are people fucking dying because they cannot get water or food. Even the American political system with the deep state and shit. Why are we even on this damn earth? Seriously, what is the point of everything in life? I simply do not view the joy of life being worth living for. I just do not understand. This whole text here is just me rambling my thought in hope that someone somewhere reading this could maybe help me.",0.244

"As you live life and learn new thing you grow more mature. Life is not about growing up and making plan for tomorrow, it is about enjoying every moment a you are living. Happiness is the most important thing and people have forgotten that. The world is full of so many interesting thing that all cost money and we believe having a lot of something is the key to happiness. And since money is the thing that buy u the thing we want we sort of become obsessed with getting a much of it a we can. In my mom and my situation we have tasted what money can buy u and we do not want to go back to the way thing used to be. But the thing is we were both happy then and now we are not. I have learned money cannot buy happiness. My dad and Julie do not have much money and they are happy. There is something we can all say we regret from our lives. I regret regretting. Everyday I have lived ha come to this moment and even after all the thing that have gone wrong recently, I can pretty much say I am happy with they way my life ha turned out. I am happy with who I am behind my mask. I am happy with what I know and what I want to know. Lately I have been wanting to die. Actually no, I wanted to want to die. Depression is all about seeing those bad moment and ignoring the good time in your life. When you are depressed the only thing that matter are the bad times. I do not think I wa stupid for wanting to want to die. When something go wrong you tend to act out of spite a soon a it happens because you are so overwhelmed with the moment. Most people do this - it doe not mean we are stupid it just mean we got carried away and we sometimes do thing without thinking. Now I am starting to realize that the break up with Scott wa a good thing. We were forcing something that wa not making either of u happy. Of course I did not think about either him or me and our happiness I just wanted to keep u together for a long a possible. Besides I have too many other thing going on in my life right now that I need to work on and if we were still together I would have ignored these things. I do not want to become one of those people who throw their entire life in their online journal so I will not go into everything that is going on with me. If you are my friend you know. I am through acting like someone else in order to please people. This is my life and I am the one living it. Other people will not be around my whole life but I will so therefore I am putting myself and my happiness first. No more staying in one place because I am afraid of change. I want to experience a much a I can because to me that is what life is all about. No more dwelling on the past it cannot be changed - move onto today that is were thing are happening and decision need to be made. I do not want to slip off the road by looking the wrong way like I did on my driving test which by the way I failed. But that is ok, there is always next Thursday. OK enough with the thing I have already learned and experienced. Onto new things, new places, and new people. I am tired of feeling sorry for myself and wanting to be someone else. I am going to be me again and do what make me happy. I am going to take advantage of the help I am getting and I am going to help myself get better and not depend on others to save me. And I am also sorry to Scott, one of the reason why I wa so dependent on you wa because you helped me and I thought you could save me entirely and make all the bad thing go away. I now realize I am the only one who can do that. I am sorry I turned you into my therapist. I am through with the break inside my hole, time to climb out.",0.25554

"Is it stress, depression or burn out? Hey, I am a diabetic with Autism. For the past year i have felt constant fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems, bad memory and concentration issues. I took antidepressant Cymbalta mg before this during month for major stress and it helped me with almost no side effects. But after i quit antidepressant Cymbalta mg ,the fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problem and concentration issue ha been persistent in my life. Now for years. No matter how much rest i get i feel tired. Even if excercise, eat healthy, do yoga and meditation. My blood sugar level ha been up and down lately. But even if they are controlled i feel the same. A cause could be that i have worked on a lot of project during the past years. It went a far a that i started to get suicide thoughts. I do not feel any ups or down in my life. Things i used to like to do isle enjoyable. I rather stay at home than being social. I believe i have major depression and i have visited psychologist and psychiatrist who have advised me to take antidepressants. But the question is if I am stressed, have major depression or simply burnt out. I certainly feel that i have a huge major depression. My OCD thought are back and i have been stuck on testing my blood sugar - time per day during the past year. Which also could bring my stress level up. The past year ha been very stressful for me work wise. But even if i get a weekend of rest i do not feel rested. I have been to different psychiatrist and psychologist and the conclusion is either major depression or burn out. I barely have the energy to clean my apartment anymore, wash my clothes or think about my hygiene. I feel tearful occasionally on some days. I have thought about taking antidepressant again, particularly Cymbalta since it worked for me the first time. But i have been afraid of taking them. Instead my psychiatrist described me brintellix Vortioxetine , mg per day for my depression. But the question is, i am i stressed, depressed or burnt out? Anyone have been in a similar case? Any experience of the antidepressant brintellix Vortioxetine for major depression? I am so afraid of starting to take them, but i do not want to feel this way of every morning waking up with no motivation for anything that the day brings me.",0.38616

"Feeling Trapped Hello, I am and had quite severe depression during the age of -. My past year of life from the age - have actually been great and I have had no problems. I have had a girlfriend since the age of whom I love. I have worked a few different mundane jobs, and have been going to school for electrical engineering. I am entering my last year of undergraduate school in the ASU online program. The reason my depression ha returned is because I feel trapped, mainly due to my living situation. I would consider my upbringing to be the low end of middle class, and yes I realize there are people much worse off than I am. I grew up in a family of , parent and sibling including myself. For the past year we have lived in an sq. ft. town house in California, right off of a busy street. There are room in the house. The master bedroom is rather large, I would estimate about .x a big a the other bedroom. Up until a few month ago when my sister moved out, all of u sibling were sharing the smaller room. Now there are of use sharing it, but still two bunk bed taking up the same space. There is absolutely no space, and I am tall and do not really fit into my twin size bunk bed. My mom ha kept the large master bedroom for herself over the years, and ha forced my father to sleep in the living room, despite the fact that he is the one who pay the bills. She is a selfish person. My desk, which is where I try to study and work, and where I spend most of my time, is in the living room. My dad is usually in the living room watching TV, and there are lot of noise and distraction from other people and the kitchen etc. which make it nearly impossible to study or just relax. This did not really bother me much a a kid, but now that I am , it is getting worse and worse everyday. Because I do online schooling which wa not what I intended , I have little to no interaction with peer and my schooling is basically sitting in front of my computer at home. I feel completely trapped. The bedroom I share is completely cramped, and usually one of my other sibling is in it. In the living room I am surrounded by distraction and other people, with absolutely no privacy. It is hard to study or focus on anything. I feel like I have no space to myself, like there is nowhere to go. I often feel extremely anxious and depressed, and feel a though someone is cramming me into a box. This make me just want to cease being conscious. All I think about is how badly I need to move out. Every night it is getting worse and worse, until I decided to come here tonight to post. Due to school payments, and buying a car, it is not possible to move out with the mediocre job that I have. There is still another year until I graduate school, and even then I do not know for certain if I will be able to get a job that will enable me to move out. I will still have to pay off school loan after that. The thought of staying here for another year, or even worse - year is completely unbearable. My girlfriend and I have made plan to move out together eventually, but that probably would not happen for another year minimum. This had made me extremely depressed and anxious the past months. Does anyone have any advice for what I should do? I have been considering spending more time at library during the day. I have also been trying to spend a little more time outside and at the gym etc. But if anyone else ha been in a similar situation, please give me advice. Note I know there are people who have it much worse. Homeless, disabled, etc. I realize that and that is the main thing that I try to think about when I feel depressed and anxious. That I have it better than some people. But this is just my personal situation I am trying to deal with.",0.26929000000000003

"I am not able to do breath meditation myself, so I am a fine one to talk, but I have read that it works. The thought will come, no matter what you do. Supposedly the trick with breath mediation is that it give you distance on the thoughts, help you stand back from them a bit, and feel the accompanying emotion but not get a carried away by them. This reinforces your ability to know that they are just thoughts, and they will go away if you do not act on them. And supposedly either with breath meditation or without, there is an element of fake it till you make it at work here. It is been shown that acting out anger a a therapeutic tool actually make getting angry easier than letting go of it, because it maintains the neurological pathway that anger uses. One meditation teacher call it rehearsing anger . So supposedly if you replace negative thought feeling with positive ones, like caring for the part of you that is angry and hurt, then eventually your brain will reprogram itself to think and feel positive things. Breath meditation ha become a non-religious phenomenon in recent years, like yoga. Three book that are just good reading anyway are The Art of Happiness by the psychiatrist Howard Cutler with the Dalai Lama, Destructive Emotions - How Can We Overcome Them? , by the psychologist Daniel Goleman with the Dalai Lama, and Anger- Wisdom For Cooling The Flames , by Thich Nhat Hanh, all of which discus breath meditation a a simple practice for mental hygiene a opposed to a religious practice of any sort. Supposedly the Dalai Lama wa really surprised to hear that self-loathing is common in Western culture, because it wa so uncommon in Tibet- there wa just no concept. The point of all this is, with or without meditation, is that if you notice a negative thought or emotion when it arises, rather than struggle with it to try to put it out of your mind, you should just quietly label it a negative thought and let it go away, and or replace it with a positive thought, like caring for the wounded child within you . It is odd to notice that John Bradshaw, the king of healing the wounded child , and Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, say the same thing about this. But it is being said that there is a great similarity between Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and meditation practice, because meditation practice recognizes negative self-talk and replaces it with positive self-talk, and supposedly condition the brain to react in positive ways. In Destructive Emotions there is a part about brain imaging that show that people who meditate are activating more positive part of their brains. And again, these book are just good reading anyway. But like I say, easier said than done. Supposedly it work for some people. I cannot do it, but some people can. Maybe you can. If nothing else, all these works, including Bradshaw, are good reading and you may be able to develop positive mental habit and replace the negative mental habit with them. Both breath meditation and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy have been shown to be good adjunct to recovery from depression, even if the depression itself is being treated with medication.",0.30945

I do not ever remember the last time in my life I wa genuinely excited about anything. What make everything worse is that in month, I have to decide what I am going to do with my life.

"Help, I am not sure if my partner is depressed. I need help moving forward. A little background on my partner and our relationship, he is and I am . He lost his mother to sickness when he wa year old, dropped out of school because of that and moved away to complete a foundation course. We met while he wa back home but he currently study overseas to complete his bachelor is degree. However, he is been home for the past . week a he is having his semester break. We began dating a year and month ago. He is been nothing but the most supportive and kind partner I have ever had the honour of dating. Very caring, remembers the little thing and is very physically affectionate. However for the past . weeks, he is been incredibly hot and cold with me. The worst instance having been on Thursday day ago . We had planned to meet at pm, but at pm he asks if we can meet at pm because nothe weather is too hot . Fair enough, so we decide to meet at pm. When I meet him, he is cold and withdrawn and doe not even acknowledge me. I reach for his hand and he let me hold it, but the bus ride is filled with nothing but silence. He is looking out the window and he doe not want to speak to me. We reach our destination and head to a restaurant for early dinner, but he order one tiny dish and doe not want to eat anymore because he ha no appetite. I asked him what is wrong and he said he is just tired. I asked if he is angry at me and he say no. He continues being very physically affectionate by holding my hand and holding my waist but he doe not want to make eye contact with me or kiss me. He smile all of time while we are out. We then decide to head to a bar his decision, even though I told him I am okay with going home , but we just drank our beer in silence, I tried telling him about a book I had just bought but I could tell he wa disinterested. While on the way back home, I teared up while telling him that I have been trying so hard to communicate with him but I have just not gotten a response. He tell me that he is tired and it is got nothing to do with me. We head back home and I tell him to text me when he is back home but he doe not. It is been day since then and I texted him last night but to no response it is been hour . Other reason why I think he may be depressed are - A week before he came home, he found out his dog of year passed away. - He ha a very erratic sleep schedule. He will sleep at am, wake up at noon. - He doe not want to do thing that we planned to do. We wanted to go for an exhibition and he said we will go next week but that ha not happened yet. - We have not had sex in a week. - He ha not met his best friend of a few year even though he is been home for . weeks. - He ha not made contact with me for days, this is out of the ordinary. - He is totally checked out of social media, not stayed up to date with meme and Instagram story with the only exception being last night when he watched my Instagram story - His Instagram and Twitter bio is Have fun. Be kind. Die. !! I feel so lost and helpless, and I feel like I am grasping at straw trying to figure out what is going on. I do not know if this could be depression or if it is just a case of him checking out of this relationship. If any of these sign are an indicator, please please please let me know what I can do. I feel especially on edge because he is leaving to go back to uni in a few day but I do not know when I will be able to see him again. I do not know how to reach out to him, he did not respond to my text message and the last thing I want to do is shove him deeper into isolation.

About month ago my mother passed away. A week ago my father went into the hospital to have open heart surgery done on him, and today he came back and is definitely looking worse for wear. For the time being he cannot do anything physical, cannot drive, and just look like he is in pain, and is talking about probably retiring. Meanwhile in my life i am struggling between choosing to go off to college or getting a full-time job. Only just a week ago I wa getting ready to start to apply to FAFSA in preparation for actually starting college this year -- now with recent development i am not sure if that is even a viable option. I will probably need to stay home and help out by getting a full-time job since both me and my brother are reliant on my dad financially, and my brother is already in college. I really do not know what I want to do or what I even can do. Add onto more shallow but personal reason for me to feel down, like the fact that I have no social life to speak of and honestly it is enough to make me seriously consider suicide.

Guy number two said he would not do what guy number one did to me.. and now I feel like he is doing the same exact thing that guy number one did to me.. we have not talked in two weeks.

"I think letter are a wonderful way to communicate. That way you do not say anything without thinking about it first. I wa not clear if your mother actually read the letter or not. If she ha not, I might suggest approaching the letter with just the first issue of the way she treat you without the father issue in one letter. That might open dialogue and allow you guy to focus on fixing that first. I understand your fear of authority figures. When I wa that age I am now I could not talk to anyone of authority. My mom, who wa shy herself had to do that kind of stuff for me. Could another one of your relative go with you to take your driver test? Nana or Sonny who you mentioned in the letter? If it help to hear, I did get over my fear of authority figure and sometimes I go overboard and challenge them to make up for lost time? . I never had psychotherapy, but I wish I had. So do not discount it, nip it in the bud if you are able to. One other question I have is..is your mother ALWAYS this way or doe she show moment of tenderness, sympathy or interest in your life? I think that if you have seen the mom in her in the past, it sound like she ha some internal problem that she take out on you, but have nothing to do with you. Do not worry about how you should be at this age..everyone ha their own time clock inside. If we were all the same, this would be a very very boring world.

"Finished my goodbye letters. Would just like to vent a little before I hang up my hat.. For the last two month I went through hell with my relationship to my GF that I wa planning on proposing to right before this all began. Since May she is been telling me how she is depressed and doe not know why and that our relationship is failing because of it. I did absolutely everything I could to help even changing so many thing about myself. This went on for over a month until she said we needed to take a break which we began to and for the next month we were on and off yet still living together and in my eye thing were turning around for the better. Well, June th I found out the reason for all this wa that she wa talking to a co-worker that life down the street and began sleeping with him while I wa at work. Unfortunately I snapped and went to confront the guy which she blocked the door from me leaving and I just ripped it open hitting her with the door not even thinking bruising her shoulder. day later she call the cop and day after that I am arrested for domestic battery. We were planning a life together and I have never felt so betrayed. After a couple day I began to see the light and once I did my mother had a heart attack and I cannot help but blame myself for putting her through all this stress. Normally if I had family problem I would turn to Kaitlyn my GF and if I had GF problem I would speak to my mother or my brother who life half way across the country. Well, now I have no one to turn to and I am spiralling out of control. Last night I spent a few hour writing my goodbye and have been collecting a variety of sleeping pill and muscle relaxers. Im gonna try and enjoy the next couple day and then I am pulling all my money out of the bank to go find a beautiful scenery and make that my last memory. You have always been a huge help Reddit over the last few year but this is my breaking point. If convicted which I most likely will be according to my lawyer then the rest of my life is tarnished and getting a good job will be next to impossible. Hell I will probably lose my current job once my name begin to get drug through the mud.. Idk where I am going with this just really needed to vent to someone that is not gonna just tell me keep your chin up and thing will get better like my friend and family. They just do not understand the dark place that I am in right now. I have dealt with what I believe to have been mild depression for about the last year living in a very racist area and being half fillipino and half white.

"Feeling insecure that my friend hate me I am really stressing out right now. This happens all the time, I feel like my closest friend hate me. But recently, it is been getting bad. He is been ignoring me in person, taking forever to text back, and being really passive aggressive while texting me. It really hurt me that he doe this, because he know I have bad mental health, but he only make me feel worse about it by making me feel worse about myself. This ha been happening for the past three months, and I have had so many urge to tell him that we cannot be friend anymore because he is hurting me so much. But I love him to death, when he is around, he support me. But the moment he stops, he act like I do not exist. It is tearing me apart. I am scared to talk to him about it because I do not want him to hate me anymore than I feel like he already does, but I just do not know what to do about it.

"How much longer can I fake it? I am , had a full-time job for several year and have a young son. I took a leave from work in for mental illness, at which point I wa diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, prescribed Zoloft and wa back at work when my short term disability ran out. This wa the first time I would been on anti-depressants. I felt tired all the time, had no sex drive, and started gaining weight, but at least I wa functional. Over the next year, I received a few verbal warning and written warning at work about my poor performance. Eventually, the mask broke and I wa on leave again in . This time I wa away for much longer, wa diagnosed w dysthymia, tried several different medications, found out that just about every SSRI gave me horrible side effect sweating, nausea, insomnia, no sex drive, I am actually thinking now that maybe they caused serotonin syndrome and eventually landed on Remeron and Wellbutrin. This combo actually started to work, without any side effect except for weight gain, which I have been managing with a diet now . This time, I returned to work because I received notice in the mail that my employment wa going to be terminated because it wa coming up on year without being at work. I figured if I wa going to be fired for not returning, I may a well return, make some money and worst thing that happens is I get fired anyways. I wa not better when I returned to work, I wa functional, I wa able to smile, but the low mood persisted in a big way. And so here I am, still working, trying to fake it everyday, feeling like a house of card thats ready to topple. I am afraid because if I go off work again that will have been leaf of absence, and I really do not think I could show my face around here anymore after that. I remember how horrible my life felt when I wa on medical leave. I remember falling behind on child support, having to borrow money from my parents. I remember trying to convince my girlfriend that my low sex drive wa because of med and not because of her. I remember trying to convince an insurance company that I am sick, while simultaneously trying to convince myself that I can get better. I remember feeling like a useless waste of skin that drained on the resource of everyone that dared to care about me.

I have been to two shrinks, neither for depression but a anger problem, though I do not have one, just Mom and me fight and we have always been close. No one ha ever known that I have thought of suicide except when I wa in junior high and it wa not really much true, sure a little but I wa more agreeing with my cousin when she said that she ha thought of such. Now I have been recently noticing for a small bit month now how I have been having some I guess you would say symptom pardon my spelling of depression and all. Especially I have been losing interest in thing and feeling guilty over everything and that is the most extreme ones, I have some others too. I have taken online test and it say that I may have depression. But I cannot believe I do. I mean why would I have depression. I would just guess I am making it up to myself or something. We will I have always been interesting in psychology stuff like personality disorders, so maybe I am just reading into it wrong or something. That would probably be what a shrink would say so I do not want to go to one, plus I do not really like talking to them. Another thing is one of my friend just attempted suicide, lucky survived and if I say something to someone they would think I am just saying such because of that. I have felt like this before that though .. another thing is I am a Christian and Christians should not feel this way, right?

"I am a year old man with a history of depression I wa diagnosed when I wa and of standing apart -- not refusing to fit in out of some sense of rebellion, but not fitting in simply because I could not. I have never been married. I have had only one long term relationship -- it wa long - distance and very turbulent for both my partner and I the relationship ended three year ago . To this day I wonder why I do not measure up , why I cannot seem to find my place in life. While not physically stunning by any means, I never thought I wa hideous, either -- though my look have most often been pointed out to me a a shortcoming, so that is the explanation I tend to go with most of the time. When I hit my teenage years, panic disorder became a problem, too a I realized how little control I had over my life and the way it wa going to turn out . At the beginning of each year, I stand back and take stock of my situation, asking myself where am I right now? Which direction am I headed in from here? What are my options? Up until now, I could always find some reason to be at least a little hopeful, to keep going -- but this year I cannot. I have been out of work for a long time, the panic attack are getting bad again, I have had a number of relatively minor but still worrisome health problem in the last few month -- and worst of all, after so many years, I am still alone.

But now, in college, it the same but so much more lonely. All my friend are away, and I am rotting here. I feel so alone. On top of this, I miss my ex from a year ago. We went from meeting, to best friends, to huge fallout, to reconciliation, to best friends, to dating, to nothing. I miss the friend part. This loss ha dampened my mood for a year now.

"Depressed people get sick, too How stigma in the medical community made me sicker I have often found myself in a chicken and egg situation with my doctor when it come to depression. When I say I am sick, they are too quick to assume the depression is the cause of my pain and not the other way around. After five minute listening to me breathe, looking into my throat, and and touching the outside of my neck, they are stumped so it must be mental illness. It got the the point that when I wa having severe abdominal pain, I did not go to the hospital. I had to push for any kind of testing, which took forever. When I finally found a doctor who listened to me, she told me I should have gone to the ER. Then I wa depressed about that I had let the other doctor make me doubt my own sanity. Turns out, I have been pretty sick and needed surgery. Nearly all of the issue they blamed on depression were due to a chronic, painful illness with no cure. It is bittersweet, I have solved a big piece of the puzzle for sure. But I am still struggling a lot. I just found out that I may be infertile. After my doctor said having a baby could help my condition. So that wa depressing too. I do not think my depression caused my infertility. Checkmate, doctors! I did start seeing a psychiatrist, and he is a kind man. He diagnosed me with depression and anxiety. He ha never suggested that my depression is the cause of my physical problems, and he seems to be sympathetic to me a a chronic pain patient. He is given me depression medication, but I do not know how much it is helping. Chronic illness is a thing that happens to people and it is just depressing . I have always had depression, but this just make it worse. He ha never dismissed me for feeling that way or written off my pain a being in my head.

"My long-term relationship ended without a breakup conversation. My bf just ghosted me and stopped talking to me without any explanation. I am feeling very depressed and need some advice? I f found out through Instagram that my long-term bf m wa cheating on me with multiple women. I have noticed the last month together he is been distant and acting strangely. Now all his strange behavior make sense. After I found out I texted him letting him know that I found out about the cheating and that I lost all respect for him. He did not even bother responding or giving me a call. There wa no text back, no phone call back. Zero conversation. I sent the text a week ago. I loved him so much and I cannot believe after all this time together he is just going to ghost me and leave me without a final conversation. Him ignoring me is so awful and selfish and is mind-boggling to me. I went ahead and deleted his number and deleted him off social media. Moving forward, how can I feel better about the whole situation? I feel sick to my stomach and absolutely awful. I have been cry so much and just want to start feeling better.",0.35667000000000004

"Still recovering from ex-girlfriend To preface this, I am sure anyone who read this ha seen something similar on this sub a million time already. This is long and the last three paragraph are my main point, the rest is just an explanation of my previous relationship. A little over a year ago my ex and I finally split after a long year and a half of on and offs filled with ton of emotional abuse. It wa mainly her abusing me at first, getting angry for not texting her quickly enough, coming at my neck for hanging out with friend everynight I assume wa because she stayed home all the time and so on. The last couple time we dated she wa always angry with me for cheating which I never did later to find out she wa the one cheating on me. I wa extremely depressed once we finally cut tie that I went back and talked to her and then she told me she cheated in detail so she could bring me down more. After the breakup I ended up getting sick and after a couple month could not even bring myself to take care of myself. Small stuff like wearing my retainer and showering before pm wa the hardest part of my day. I know that seems small but it play into how I feel now. month after the breakup I started talking to a friend I met through my ex however they were not and still are not friend anymore and we have been happily together for almost a year now. There wa a lot of useless drama with my ex about this which ha been resolved but she still try to harass me and my girlfriend. Last month she texted my phone from her friend number trying to harass me and it wa just ridiculous. Unfortunately I have to see her in May for my girlfriend is prom, they are in the same senior class and I an currently a college sophomore. I still feel a though I am in a rough place and do not physically look a good a I should. Stuff such a my teeth and acne and other result of that loss of hygeine that I still struggle with make me feel like I have been doing worse than her, which I know should not matter but it still bother me. I have tried getting my old habit back which work for a month and then I lose track again. I guess my overall issue is I compare myself how I wa when with her to where I am now, mostly with my appearance. I am also still very depressed and feel that it put me below her now. My only real win is that I have nearly kicked my drug addiction mainly weed, I wa using it to runaway from my problem but now I cannot seem too kick my other habit of nicotine addiction and taking any kind of pill or cough syrup just to not be sober. I have distanced myself from friend and I simply feel lost and useless to the world. In college I cannot make new friend and just sit in my dorm room wishing I could go back and start over so I could be healthier than I am now. I am looking for advice or anyone to be straightforward with me on any aspect of my situation. Thank you to anyone who read this and responds!",0.36809000000000003

"I thought thing were getting better.. Sorry for the little rant.. I just needed to say this somewhere. After recently getting out of the hospital for a nother attempt at my life, I wa surrounded by family and friend who want to support me. For a couple day this almost gave me a high, thinking that maybe I really am glad I wa not able to go through with it or that maybe I wa beating these year of depressiveness. Not even just after a week of getting out of the mental ward, I fantasize about what I could have done differently to have made sure I died that night. Going forward I thought I would be happy being able to see my younger sibling and my dog again, yet the only thing I can think of is them knowing I tried killing myself, and that I have added just another thing to deal with and another burden on them. I will now be treated with care and people will be on guard around me, and I did not want to do that to them.

"Feeling numb I have realized that if I cannot talk to someone about my feeling then the next best thing is to write them down and seek advice from reddit so here I am. I am on campus right now preparing for my midterm and my confidence is at an all time low. I have not even seen the paper and already I feel a if I have lost. I never thought I would reach such a low in my life. Something weird happened today. I finally set up a countdown timer to the day my exam result are announced. That seemed like the next logical step and it made complete sense to me in a weird way. The only thing that made me remove that wa talking to my parent and seeing the hope and love for me in their eyes. I know my life is not truly mine and that if I hurt myself then I also hurt other people but it is just getting too much. The thought is always there in my mind and for the past few day that voice ha gotten stronger. I have been through this period before and had come out nearly unharmed and at the beginning of the year I wa feeling optimistic about what is to come but that lasted all of one month. The future I wa dreaming of look bleak and distant and with every passing minute that future keep on going farther and farther away from me. I try very hard to keep my guard up near people I know and love but it is becoming harder and harder to do so. I used to think that I wa destined to do some good in the world but maybe that wa just me being delusional. It is getting harder to keep the tear in. Whenever I used to feel numb, I used to punch the wall just to feel something but even that is not helping now. All I wanna do is talk to someone and pour my heart out but I do not know if I have the strength left to do that. Getting out of bed is starting to feel like a struggle and for the first time in a while I am afraid of myself, of what I might do if thing do not go my way. I know that this is not the end of the line but why doe it feel like it is? How can anyone recover from such a failure? It is gotten so bad that I would much rather prefer that I disappeared than having to tell my parent what is wrong. Depression is nothing new for my university and it would not be the first time that someone took a drastic step and now I know why they did what they did. The pressure and stress which come with a university a respected a mine, is just too much to handle. I am almost inclined to reveal my university is name just in case someone is able to figure out who I am and I can finally get the respite I desire so much. All around me I see happy face and I can only hope that one day I can leave all this behind me and be happy but in the meantime I guess I just have to struggle on and wait for the light at the end of the tunnel.",0.32880000000000004

I am starting to feel really frustrated with life because there are thing I do not understand about the world. My problem is I think too much and I wish I wa off in space thinking about a night out in the city but I am not. Instead I focus on every negative thing I can. I would never kill myself and because I would not do that I really want to know how I can get over all this shit and be happy with what I got. I do not know if it is my mind playing the victim but I feel like everyone close to me is out to hurt me. For example I am and I do not have a car. I can understand I should already have it like two year ago but this a prime point for my parent to pick on me. For some reason my mom got herself into a bit of a mood and started having a go at me which caused me to end up in tear because she told me I am hopeless and so are all my brother and that I am an embarrassment. This is all because I do not have a car! She is usually really caring but she came out with all this stuff. Am I going crazy or is it really a huge deal to not yet have a car? Is it worth hurting your daughter over?? Then there is my supposed boyfriend who pick on me about my weight. I am not a thin a I once was. I have put on about kilo in years. I know it is not a good thing but for age everything wa about my weight. I used to weigh kg which is tiny and now I am kg. My boyfriend is at university and think that my life hold no meaning because I apparently have no hobby and I just turn up to my little job . I have friend that are completely selfish and I always end up paying for everything and they cannot even do me a simple favor. I do not want to play the victim because I have been a punching bag for so many people who themselves have played the victim so it is nothing I would aspire to be. I could write page and page and page of how annoyed I am but I thought I would just give an idea. I am sick of people being the way they are to me and making me out to be a energy drain.

"Trying to understand my depressed SO I am sorry if I am posting in the wrong sub. I just figured you guy could offer perspective So my SO is away for work for more than a month , but we are still in the same time zone. Lately, he is been having bad episodes, but a week ago he said he had a really session with his therapist there. I am proud to say that he said I wa the only person who managed to convince him to seek professional help! So, okay, so far so good. When he ha bad days, sometimes he like to check out of the world . He also feel that opening up about his struggle might be too much of a burden for me. But we had a discussion before wherein I said, I understand that you might need space, but let me know if you are having a bad day, and you are not in a chatty mood. Not sure if this wa the right approach, but this wa the time before the therapist and after we learned that he had to be away for more than a month. And for the most part, he is been open with me. This weekend really bothered me because it wa radio silence, despite my check ins, and despite not asking how are you question . For example, we are both big football soccer fan so I tried to talk about the World Cup. He is a huge fan of the French team which won the Cup. Nothing. My anxious nature is making thing more challenging because now I am thinking is it the depression or relationship issues? My anxious self might pester him for answer but I am not sure if that is helpful. So, I am not sure how to go about this. Let him be and try not to freak out until he returns?

I always believed that those girls, wearing the most revealing clothes are the one that ask for it, but do they really?

Recently I have not had any outbursts. I am currently taking Cymbalta and Celexa and that seems to be a good combination.

"Hi, sorry if this turn into a lengthy post, but I could do with some advice, and I think this is probably the best place to ask. Firstly, I should point out, I am a year male. My problem is that I am concerned by the physical effect the depression is having on me. I have probably been suffering from depression for several years, but I only sought medical help last November after I had a breakdown. The doctor ha prescribed me with Fluoxetine, and I am taking mg per day. I originally started off on mg per day, but after I told the doctor what I will tell you now, about month ago, he upgraded my status to severe depression, hence the increase in dosage. I can appreciate that my mindset is slightly biased towards feeling negative, and expecting the worst, but nevertheless I cannot help but feel my symptom might be the result of an even more serious problem. The medication ha helped my mind even though I still have plenty of lows, they are not always a severe a they were month ago , yet my physical health is deteriorating to the point where that is the main factor preventing me from accomplishing day to day tasks. My symptom are a follows and they may be generalized, I will admit Constant fatigue, even after plenty of rest constant aching throughout the body generally feeling very weak, lacking energy and strength, e.g. carrying shopping home can leave my arm in agony loss of coordination, I have become very clumsy, always knocking glass over, or dropping thing for no reason occasional loss of balance, usually when getting up, or starting to walk from a stand still joint are feeling slightly stiff, they still move, but I can feel more resistance than normal and they get very tired very quick if wa to use them, or even just hold my arm straight out in front of me and for me, the worst symptom is an almost constant tremor in both hand and arms, which sometimes spread throughout the body. If I attempt slow, fine movement with my hands, the tremor becomes very clear and result in jerky movements. Also, I like to exercise, yet after all exercises, even low intensity ones, the trembling seems to intensify. I doubt it is anxiety, a I still shake when I am calm, relaxed and immobile. I know I cannot expect I diagnosis, but I would appreciate it if anyone can tell me if the severity of the physical effect I am experiencing, is quite common, even when the mental state is much more relaxed and beginning to recover?

I cannot remember the last time I truly felt happy either - I think it wa probably about or year ago when I wa in college, had a great social life and thought I wa with a great guy cially, I find it very difficult to stay in touch with people because I am paranoid that they do not really want to hear from me. I lost touch with friend when I moved to college, and then lost friend when I moved back to my home town. Now I have very few friends, and feel the one I do have do not really care too much about me.

Then later my mother found out about what i had done and became so angry with what i had done, that she made me cry, and i actually woke up crying. Then later that day i took a nap and i dreamt that i wa being seduced by Tom Cruise, who had gained a lot of weight , and when thing began to heat up i rejected him, and he became very angry at me. He then later came to the house where i was, and began trying to hurt me and the people around me which wa an older lady, a young boy and teenage girl . i could hear him saying just kill them and talking about how he wa really embarrassed when i rejected him, and he could do so much better than me. i then proceeded to take the young boy into hiding, and while hiding we were found and the boy hurt Tom defensively, but in a very graphic manor. I cannot understand why i am having such negative dreams, why they are so vivid, and what they all mean!",0.318

If I did not work for my father I am sure I would be unemployed..due to my concentration problems, ATTENDANCE problems, uneven mood and unpredictable production level..so I am very lucky. I can see what challenge you face. I often thought that I might like to go into some sort of counseling because of my life experience also. Do you live in a big enough city that you can apply at some mental health clinic or government aid departments? Sometimes the willingness to do that kind of work can get you in the door. It may be entry level, but you could work up if it were a job that satisfied your needs. What about like an activity director at a youth home, or a retirement village senior home, or a special need program? Here our recreation commission ha a special population program that coordinate trip and activity for the special population of the area. They go on ski trip and day trip and it look very fun! Of course it take a certain frame of mind to be able to work with the special population of the world. But I just mention it because you talked about counseling..

"When people with good intention say the wrong shit.. How do you deal with it? When someone who is just trying to help you say something that cut you really deeply, or when they are pushing you when you just need them to back off while. How do you personally deal with it? Recently I had an Uncle who I wa close with get involved trying to help with my depression and anxiety issues. He encouraged me to go see a therapist again for the first time in year and wa just there to talk and encourage. Then when he saw progress he started pushing more and more and I started getting really stressed. Then when I had a break down and started slipping back he took said some shit to me which really cut me deep. I stopped talking to him for a while after that. He said thing that confirmed what I thought people in my family were thinking abou me. Now the issue I am facing. I do not feel justified in being angry at him because he wa trying to help and he just got too excited at seeing progress that I had made many time before and then he got frustrated when it came to a halt. So now I just feel guilty at having the feeling and the anger turn inward and eats me up. But the anger and hurt do not go away from what he said either. It is been month and I just do not want to talk to or see him at all. He is reaching out again and I cannot find the word to explain the anger and hurt I feel, because I feel like I should not be angry or hurt. So it is just a big spiral of anger and shame. The worst part is I do not know of I can ever have the same relationship I had with him before. We were buddies. Even if I get over this I just do not know if the trust will ever be back. This make me sad. I did not really want him involved, but good intention make it hard to tell people their help is not wanted.",0.26292000000000004
"Dear reddit, happiness is not a choice for everyone I am sorry but I need to get this off my chest in a place where people will understand me. Dear people that think happiness is a choice, it is not. Me or my fellow sufferer do not choose to be miserable. In fact if it really wa that simple, I am sure of u would choose to be happy without even having to think. I feel sad because I have mental illness. If you do not know, that mean my brain is not normal. My brain ha deficiency and such that keep me from feeling happy, even when I should. I am so sick of reading reply to mine and other people is post about depression that try to oversimplify a serious mental illness that can cause suicide. I swear everyone on this website assumes we do nothing to try to help ourselves. I really cannot believe people are that misinformed that they really think that many people choose to be that miserable. You would not choose to be miserable if you had the choice, and so would we. But we do not get that choice. Then we have comment like Just put a life together that wont make you depressed . I think these piss me off the most. If it wa really that simple you think I would of done that by now? Also a lot of people do not mention how hard changing your life can be if you do not have money or resources.

I also looked for similar post regarding what I will ask, but i really want a tailored answer for my own sanity. Sorry for being selfish, this is just hard. I have been dating this girl for almost a year and I know she ha been slipping into an abyss of what I cannot diagnose, but seems like depression. I will start with a time table. We began dating after meeting on a popular dating app and we hit it off fast. Similar interest, goals, outlooks, expectations, and lifestyle. We became extremely close with in two month and then out of the blue she tell me it over. I did not feel it wa a justifiable way to end the relationship. I contacted her and we had long winded email correspondence with in which she had this quote to me I feel lost at work, lost in my personal life, and just lost with trying to find my happiness. You do make me happier. And idk what just snapped last week but I wa super depressed all week . I talked with her and we set small goal to rekindle and help her find her happiness. We got back together with in two week and that started a prolonged honeymoon period for which we traveled, went on ski trips, took our dog on hikes, and generally enjoyed ourselves. This continued until march or , when I noticed her slipping back in to her just overall never satisfied state. I got worried and tried to lightly push her to no avail. I then tried to make plan at least twice a month to help distract her and give her a solid thing to look forward to. She never changed and just got worse to the point where the last months, she get home from work smoke enough weed to put me to sleep, eats too much and then go to sleep by . I tried to encourage by proxy by going to the gym and going to park with her dog and taking picture and even getting closer with her family. nothing worked. Fast forward to week ago, she went to Sweden on a vacation with her best friend and had a blast and wa calling me everyday so happy and excited. I thought we had a legitimate break through. Then one week before she return i start to only get or text a day, I figure she is living her best life to busy with international travel to communicate regularly like she requested. She return and we spend one night together and she call me at school to come over to her place asap. she dump me with little to no explanation.

The truck wa not moving, the gun wa in use. So why were a bunch of kid just sitting there? Do not human being usually seek to protect themselves from danger?

"Feeling good about helping people Does anyone else here ever feel better about themselves when you are able to offer a little help or guidance to someone off the street you do not know? As an example, sometime last month I wa having a pretty meh day, just.. Not feeling the worst ever, but not feeling very good either, when on my way home I happened to find an iPhone sitting on a grate outside the subway station. I picked it up and looked around for the owner, then after entering the station found a couple of young woman searching their bag and I asked if the phone wa theirs. It was, and they said thank you so much! And I felt really happy that I would been able to help them, like, I just kinda decided right then to forget about my problems, because, I would helped someone. Like, maybe those two would have never found their phone if I had not come along. I mean they probably would have, but, y know. I felt like I would been helpful in a real small but meaningful way and that felt good. I really like helping people, but I usually get upset when I try to help people I actually know personally, because, well, people do not always want help with more personal issues, or even with simple issue from people they know well, and trying to tell when to help or not is just really complicated. Like, I will just real nicely try to suggest a solution to a problem, or simply offering some consolation, and instead of, I dunno, actually trying it or telling me patiently why that is not a good idea, they just rail on me and tell me to shut up or whatever. And I just feel like, jeez, what would I do? I am trying to help here.. And I always get real upset about that and doubt myself over it, like, am I doing a bad thing by trying to be nice? I know that is not true, I get sometimes people want to figure thing out on their own, or I guess you do not like my attitude or blablabla, but, I dunno, you cannot maybe acknowledge that I am trying to do good? But in a situation where it is just strangers, trying to find their way, cross the street, lost a thing or whatever, it is easy to tell when they need help, because everything is a lot more straightforward, if that make sense. If someone need help, it is usually pretty obvious and they are almost always pretty receptive to help, and, provided you just look like a normal person, they do not judge. No bias or baggage over past interaction or whatever, they are just happy to have help. So yeah I guess this is a little longer than it need to be, but, yeah. Helping random people feel good and distracts from my depression a little. Is what I wa saying. Anyone else feel this way?",0.18131
"Every Day is Exactly the Same. I am Lonely, Worthless, and Done With Life Every day, I wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep. That is basically it. That is my life. Sure, I have a few friend that I see on the weekends, but it only help so much. My ex girlfriend broke up with me and moved out of our apartment month ago now. The almost three year we were together were the only time in my life where my depression wa pretty much nonexistent. When she came home that day and told me she wa done, I wa floored. I had no idea that she felt the way she did, and she would not even discus the matter with me. I have tried meeting other people since then, and I have gone on exactly three date with one person. That is it. I am basically invisible to women, and no amount of effort will ever change that. I just have to accept the reality that I hold absolutely no value in a romantic context. Why? I do not know. Maybe it is because my generation is only interested in people who are aesthetically in the top tier, or make the most money. Maybe it is because my generation is eschewing committed relationship in favor of having fuck buddy left and right, whoring themselves out to whoever will get their rock off, both men and woman are at fault for this. I do not think I am a particularly unattractive guy, and I make a pretty damn good amount of money for my age, but since I am not in that top of men, I am just always going to be passed over and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. It is almost like there something inherent to my existence that prevents me from having any intimacy. No matter how much money I make or how much I improve myself, that intrinsic quality of my being will always hold me back. I did not ask for this, but it is the way thing are, so I have pretty much given up completely. I do not have any plan of offing myself or anything like that. But every day, it get harder and harder to convince myself that I actually have anything worth living for. The one thought I keep coming back to is how scared my cat would be if I gave her to a shelter or how she would get by if I were gone. I love my cat, and she doe not deserve to be put in a situation like that. I feel like she is the only thing keeping me marginally together. The thought of causing her any distress break my heart, and one of the big thing on my mind all the time is simply making sure she is happy and feel safe. I feel worthless and frustrated. I wish I understood how to achieve what I want in life and be happy, but I guess that is just not in the cards. I cannot wait until the day I die, I will finally get some goddamn peace and quiet.

"Painfully lonely and spiraling into the worst depression I have ever been in I recently moved to a new city for a job after college. I have a few friend at work, but they are a group of guy that I do not have a lot in common with and we do not really talk outside of the occasional work conversation. They are nice and I am happy to be friend with them, but it is hard for me to really get to know them because they do guy stuff on the weekend like sitting around drinking and playing FIFA that I am totally not interested in they do not bother inviting me to. Other than that, I have a few online friend that I am growing increasingly dependent on for social interaction which is really unhealthy. I notice myself getting more paranoid with them about not responding, and I bug them way too much to the point where I know I would definitely be annoyed if I wa them. Also they are not very supportive probably the opposite but it is not their fault -- they are just causal online friend that should not have to cater to my current host of mental problems. I am totally alone. My family and college friend live hour away. I have pretty bad social anxiety and I am terrified of every new social interaction I have. I work hour and come home to my empty apartment and watch netflix to escape my own life, every day. I sometimes hear from my college friend about all of the fun they are still having together and it honestly brings me to tear that I have such a pathetic lonely life now. I have never been able to have a normal social life -- it take me forever to make close friends, and then even at my best I only have a handful of good friend at a time. I do not enjoy going out every weekend or the other obvious way of making friends, and that would not work now anyway since I would NEVER go alone and I do not have a single person that I could ask to go with me. When I wa a freshman in college I had this same problem -- absolutely zero friend and living in a totally different city. It wa the worst depression I have ever been through. I had dozen and dozen of online friend at the time now we have all lost touch and moved on from the RPG we were playing that helped ease the loneliness, and I eventually joined a student club and finally made friend after like a year of going. There is not really anything I can join like that in a non-college town.. I have been applying for a few volunteering things, they have not started but I am doubtful that it will be a good way to meet people. I honestly just need ONE person to talk to. Anyone. I do not know what is wrong with me, I am not a complete weirdo or anything and I know I can have meaningful friendship just of them have been online, and now I cannot even seem to make any fucking online friend either , but I live the loneliest life of anyone I have ever known or heard of. I have never been serious about suicide, but recently that is changed and it is becoming something I could actually picture myself doing. I am a long way from that but at this point I do not see anything getting better and I practically cry myself to sleep some day and have to hide emotional breakdown at work after eating lunch alone.

"I feel like I am spiraling downwards. I am losing people and cannot do anything about it or do the wrong things. I am just searching desperately for someone to care before it is too late. This summer ha just flown by. I work so much and made the mistake of taking multiple summer classes. I spend every moment I can trying to do fun thing with my friend but many time it is not a much a I would like. My best friend is stationed overseas, and while I have a close group of friend I have known for years, literally all of them are doing something this fall that take them elsewhere. When they are gone, I am going to be all by myself. I have been so lonely lately too. Just wanting someone to care about me. I had it and fucked it all up at the beginning of the year, and I just regret it all the time. I drink by myself a lot at night to deal with the loneliness, but it make it worse. This summer ha already just been shitty, but at least my friend are around. It is like fall is just a ticking time bomb at this point. No matter how hard I try to talk to someone new it never go my way and I am always left on read or stood up on plans. The other night, I got drunk and did something I have never done before, and that wa cut myself. Honestly, I feel like I did it to see if I could, and how it would make me feel. I guess I still do not know how it does, but I wa disappointed in myself I let it get so far. I do not know. I just feel like this year ha just been me slowly losing the only thing that make me happy.",0.40833
Need some advice Should I try to fit in by pretending to be cheerful all the time or should I show how I feel?

"I am tired of forcing myself to do things. Maybe it is me being lazy. Maybe it is my undiagnosed ADHD. I do not know. All I know is that I hate not being able to enjoy almost anything . I just feel so numb and dull. I dropped almost all of my friendship with people who are not in my workplace. Have not had the motivation to talk to anyone. It just feel like a chore to me. Socializing is torturous and I get bored very quick. I cannot seem to focus on any conversation. I hate forcing myself to do the most simple things, like taking a shower, putting on makeup, cooking, cleaning, even playing videogames. I am a huge WoW nerd, so I should be excited for the new patch and game. But, I am not. I got amped up when I saw the trailer, but now, I rather not play it. I rather not play anything. Just recently, I forced myself to play Bioshock again. It is been year since I visited Rapture. I love Rapture. But why is it so boring to play? I used to have so much fun.. How do you get out of this funk? I do not want to feel like this and it is ruining my life. Not to mention, my SO and I have not been doing well because of it. I just feel..nothing. I need help, but I do not want a therapist or any new diet plans. None of that copypaste bullshit. What actually works? Also, I forgot to mention that I smoke weed daily. I heard that it can make depression worse and I have been using it for almost two year now. Is this something I should only do at night? I originally used it for sleep.",0.24097

Okay so I am doing a really shitty job of keeping up with this journal. So Sam came and went. Not before I went to a wedding and got drunk and told her parent that I wa in love with her . Yea.. umm.. I am gay. I then told her that I thought moving to Oregon wa a bad bad idea. Not because I wa in love with her but because moving to a city for a boy that you are in love with but ha no interest in you. Not such a good idea. so anyways that made thing all fucked up and she left and we were not on the best term besides that the roommate thing just kind of fell apart. I did not get the apartment across from shaye because of credit issues. So now I am going to just move into her place. We will see how that turn out.. If we kill each other or not. I am not on the lease so if it suck I can just move out there are a few boy that are into me. However I do not think that my soul really want to be with anyone right now. I have something wrong with my heart I am doing blood work on Monday to figure out what is going on. And I took last week off for no reason at all. So I guess a lot ha happened in the last days. I should really try to keep up with this journal.,0.24125

"I have realized that I made a big mistake by starting this blog. It serf no purpose to put feeling out for public view, so I have deleted the entry from the last six months. I wa going to explain some things, but thought better of it. I think a small part of my old self ha awakened again. I am a bit ashamed of all the whining I have done here. I am embarrassed that I have sought out people in my life for emotional support when I should have dealt with thing privately, on my own. When I lost my mind to grief, I forgot everything that I knew. As the old adage go you come into this world alone, you live alone, you die alone. You solve your problem alone, need to be added. The intense pain of grief can warp your mind, impair your judgment and make you do foolish thing that you will later regret. I am sorry if I have upset anyone, but my intention wa simply an attempt at self-help, not to change the world. I wa simply searching for a way to try to deal with and escape from this pain. I have always appreciated the supportive comment left by people and I thought I had expressed that before. I never thought anyone had an expectation that I would contact them or would even really want me to contact them. I am after all, a stranger to those who have read my words. I wa getting to the point where I wa starting to consider emailing some of the people who have posted comments, just to thank them, but now I think that it is better that I do not. This is the old, public version of me writing to day. I have pushed most of the real, troubled me back down into a box for a little while. I have resolved only to let her out when I am alone. In this blog, I did dwell on many of the same thing again and again, but I wa surprised that I could actually find some release by repeatedly talking about the same thing. I think this will be my last entry, so goodbye and good luck.",0.42492

"Fuck Everything amp Everyone I decided to make a different account for this, because I need to get all of this off my chest. I hate myself and I hate my life. I feel trapped at an absolute dead end in my life, and I am not even in my twenty yet. I might a well be, considering everything I have to do. I turned a few month ago, and thing have only gotten worse. My parent are completely delusional and cannot grasp the fact that thet cause suffering for their own benefit. They would punch you in the face and find any excuse in the book to give a reason behind what they did, even if there wa not one. My mom is an asshole, to put it nicely. She is very controlling. I have called and made my own therapy appointment only to find out she cancelled them, resulting in me having to find a different therapist AND doctor twice because they would not take me because of canceling so many times, and I still have not found either, so no therapy or medication. I have next to no friend because of how she is, coupled with my inability to speak without getting anxiety. My dad is a lazy dirtbag who fight with me constantly for no reason other than he hate me. He hate how liberal I am, he hate the people I like, whatever I like he probably hates. He sits in front of a TV all day watching shit, he bitch about anything he can, yet doe absolutely nothing to fix the issue that he is the main cause of. No clean dishes? I am in the wrong even though he doe not rinse his or even bring them to the sink. Pills went missing? He take more than he is supposed to and forgets and go into a rage. So on and so forth. I honestly do not look forward to waking up anymore. I can only find peace at night and then I usually get le sleep than I should. Of course I am lazy for sleeping in. More get done quicker in le time when I get up than the whole time they have been up. I hate this stupid town and I hate my life. It feel like I am destined for absolute failure. School put a heavy amount of pressure on me too. I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up, that would be ideal honestly. The list of thing that make me happy and want to live grows shorter every day, and I am so, so lost on what to do anymore. I feel so uncomfortable and just.. wrong.

"No doubt in my mind that since I have been taking Zoloft, I do dream a lot more and sometimes very vividly. Most of mine do not make any sense either .. but on occasion, my remembered dream are so real, it is almost spooky. If only those dream were somewhat romantic, well then I would not be bringing this up, would I? .. lol Another thing I noticed is that if I am asleep and my cell phone rings, I get up, walk a few foot away, answer, carry a short conversation and afterwards, I have no recollection whatsoever.

"I think I am having a nervous breakdown I have struggled off and on for about year with anxiety and depression. The latter half ha been mostly on. Recently my psychiatrist changed my medication from Zoloft to Effexor because the Zoloft had pretty much plateaued and then started working less. I do not think the Effexor is having a very good effect on me. My depression ha been worse than ever. On top of that I found out that my dog ha bone cancer and likely will not live more than - months. She is only and she ha been my entire world since I adopted her and she ha helped me through a lot of difficult times. Because of these thing my mood have been very bad, and I had to leave work a few day ago and I have not been back since, and I am pretty sure they are going to fire me because I am still new. Although the job wa adding to my stress because they failed to tell me that we would be working mandatory overtime EVERY SINGLE DAY. I do not have much of a support system. My mom is pissed at me about work, and I am living with my grandfather who just doe not get it. I do not really have much in the way of friend which is I guess why I am ranting on Reddit looking for some kind of support. I do not really know what to do. I am going to call my psychiatrist Monday to set up an appointment and hopefully get off Effexor. I want to find a job that is le intense than this one, and le hours. Hopefully part time.

"I am and for almost two year have been dealing with anxiety. It is strange the way of hitting and I would like to know from some of you expert if it is typical GAD. For almost two year I have been awakened almost every day at about out of sound sleep with this feeling of anxiety. At first it hit my spine, now my stomach. If I take a xanax it will dissipate and not bother me much until later in the day. Again, no matter what I am doing I can feel it start to build, take a xanax and go on with life. By late afternoon it is gone and doe not return until the next day. During this period my thyroid ha been going haywire, probably from four surgery in four years, the last being two month ago..a total knee repacement.. About sox weels before this surgery, after changing my thyroid med a bit, the anxiety had left me. I wa fine through the operation and then about three week after, it wa back! Before the operation I wa beginning to get some real bout of rolling depression but they are gone for now .. just anxiety. The thing that I question is that it is the same no matter what is or ha happened in my life for the day. I can have a great, relaxed day or a hectic, chaotic day and the next day will be exactly the same. My environment doe not seem to affect it.

"I am new and my message doe not seem to fit anywhere else. I have been suffering from depression since I wa now but I have only recently thought of it a wouldepression a I used to think it wa just me and all my feeling were real. It started with wanting to end up in hospital - get hit by a car etc. I felt useless and boring and unwanted by my family or anyone. Felt like I wa jus in the way wherever I went. I felt empty and the only escape I ever had wa fantasizing about the day I die - that release that I would feel from everything. So I used to write suicide note and when I could read them without cry then I would deem myself ready. Or I would think that if I could starve myself for a week then I would be ready. This one I could not do finally it all got too much. In my head, my parent were so disappointed in me that they would be better off without me and to my sister I wa too annoying that they would not miss me. Up until now I had jus cut myself discreetly. So I took paracetamol not knowing then that they cannot actually kill you and jus sat around waiting - half excited half scared. Nothing happened for age and I started to get more scared - what would my parent think? Would they cope? Would they blame themselves? So I threw up and called an ambulance myself. I will never get over how hurt they were by what I had done and so will never do that again. But I still think bout it. When ever thing get too hard. I think how can I make it look like an accident a I know they could handle that much better than suicide. I have been on antidepressant for month now. For the rd time. But it seems that they are just putting a blanket over how I am feeling and I am not addressing the real issue not that I know what they are. I cannot get motivated to study, go to class, go out, anything. I do not care. I do not see the point in living a miserable life and what if there is no point? what if our world are all the creation of our mind and once our mind are dead, so is our world so there is no one left hurting once were gone? What is the point to a miserable life when it could all be ended now? I do not think suicide is the right way to go - I believe only god, whatever you conceive him to be if anything should have the only power over life and death, but why doe he take some people and not others? More specifically, me? I pray that he will take me next - give me the cancer meant for someone who love life - but a yet ha been to no avail. But if all we are to do is to be alive then die, why can I not decide to take my death into my own hands, like so many people do what they want with their lives? Of course, there is always the factor of limbo - do people who commit suicide really end up in limbo? I suppose what scare me even more is that - going through the pain and anguish of suicide just to end up in limbo - with just your mind, thinking away for ever.. are my feeling wrong? Is it a chemical reaction in my brain? Or do I just not belong in this life? So confused! And just do not see the point in being here - anyone have the answer I am looking for?

"Crashing In Sorry this is long. I have been depressed since I wa . First sign were at age . I found pot and stayed high for years. Clean and sober for years, I never stopped having suicidal thought despite medication. So I tried to bury the pain in relationships, which did not work either. I have been married three time in recovery. I had a daughter who I love very much, and we used to be very close. She became a reason to live. Then year ago she did not want to live with me time any more. She became argumentative and we fought a lot. Last year I found out she wa accusing me of sexual abuse, with help from her mom first wife and therapist, which is not true. The therapist never reported the abuse, and told daughter I have NPD, which also is not true. So I got a guardian ad litem to investigate and found my daughter wa suicidal, claiming PTSD because of the alleged molestation. The lawyer never helped my daughter, sparking a slide into deeper depression. My wife and parent did not do much to try to help. They got angry when I begged them to step in. Suidical ideation and inappropriate attention-getting threat became an actual plan, and a way to do it without leaving the stain of suicide. Then at work I made a billion discovery that is extremely disruptive in the industry I work in. My quarter million dollar program found out million are being spent on the wrong strategy. And my team work on the other strategy at the same time a they are helping me, so they are taking step to undermine the findings. Lately they gave up trying to block the discovery, and the fact that we can literally feed more people with no more land used for farming, by raising more animal naturally with the same amount of feed. I am getting invited to speak globally about the discovery. The suicidal thought deepen, knowing the disruption to status quo is only beginning. Just before Christmas my third wife moved out, and I spent Christmas alone because my parent were sick. Last night she told my mom she intends to get a divorce. The medicine is not working. The AA old timer are saying I am depressed because I am not working the step correctly. I am going to - meeting a day, most days. In two day I am shutting down the case I opened to try to get help for my daughter. I can hardly work, because I cannot complete thought very well any more, being so depressed. I have been complaining about feeling depressed and suicidal, because it is true, and it became a way to relate to the world, which make people leave. The spiral is getting tighter, and it feel like a black hole is pulling me in. I cannot imagine facing another divorce feeling this low. Mom said to get a roast beef out of the freezer and cook it with some potato and carrot and stop thinking about negative things. I went to Landmark and they say this is all just a story, and part of a racket I created to avoid responsibility. They say I can create something different by changing my story. I have tried a rainbow of medicine, and tomorrow I increase Latuda from mg to , and keep the trintellex at , per MD. I cannot do anything now because third wife will get , and parent are too old to deal with my belongings. My thought turn to seeing if I can find someone else who will love me anyway, or giving up. I want to give up but not really. I really want to live, but I cannot see any hope. And I cannot stand the thought of being alone. Any help, hope or idea would be appreciated. Thank you.",0.35667000000000004
"I lost my job, i am in the worst place i have ever been, and nothing make sense or feel fair. I have worked at the same place for nearly three years. It is an entry level retail job, but i have not ever had anything else, so it wa really the only thing that made me feel validated. Recently, for the fifth time i got passed up for a promotion, but this time marked the end. The girl who got promoted over me is one of my best friend in the world. She is absolutely amazing, and i am so happy for her, but it wa the hardest to accept. She started about a year ago, and i helped train her and build her up. Fairly quickly, we became the face of the job that we did. She wa my partner in everything, and i feel like i would be there for the thing she could not do, and she would be there for the thing i could not do. Seeing her success is the most proud i have ever been, but it is made me the most miserable. I basically found out that after busting my as for over two years, my partner wa going to be my boss. I hate that. I lost the person that wa my rock in the thing that i did. I do not want to work under her, i wanted to be there with her. She told me when it happened out of respect for me, and i turned in my resignation the next day. Now the only thing that made me feel validated and gave me security is gone, and i do not know what to do. My friend understood everything of course. More than just being my partner in work, she wa the only person who could tell when thing got really bad for me. When i hide how miserable i am, she is the first person to notice, and the only person who understands and will tell me what i need to hear. If there is any upside to all of this, it is that at least i still have my friend. In my overthinking and fear, i guess i wa afraid this would change things. I learned pretty fast how much care and respect she hold for me, and i do not think anything will change that. I hope not. This job wa beating me down. I trained a lot of our best staff, and i had a lot of associate come to me before management, feeling like i wa more of a leader to them than our actual leadership was. We lost a lot of people due to burnout and frustration with management, but i know that i always cared about the people i got to train and help, and took a lot of pride in their success. Even after getting underpaid, undervalued, and shafted at every turn, i always stayed because i cared about the people i worked with and i would not give up on them. One would think that leaving a shit situation would make me happy, but it just doe not. Despite my year retail and leadership experience, it is been hard to find another job. Most people offer me le money than i made before not much and basically completely ignore any qualification i actually have. I am in school. I finish community college this year and will move to a four year school assuming i can a my performance is not amazing. I I want to pursue grad school to gain qualification a an industrial org psychologist, but everything seems so far away. I feel like with being a Psych major i am just going to end up equally a useless with a four year degree, and even if grad school doe work out, that is overall another four year from now. I have to pay bills, and i hate feeling so useless. I am not going to starve and die or anything. My family ha money, and ha offered to help me pay bill if i cannot find a job, but that just make thing worse in a way. I moved away from home because i wanted to be my own person. It ha been three year and i have not had to ask for help from anybody. I hate the thought that i will have to rely on these people who have given me everything to give me more. It is not their fault that i am a fuck up. A man said to the universe Sir, I exist! However, replied the universe, The fact ha not created in me A sense of obligation. - Stephen Crane I know that life is not fair. I know nobody owes me anything, but i hate that it seems like i always end up last. My friend get to be happy, my other friend practically run the store now but not enough to help, because the SM make all the decision and she is shitty , but i have the least and i get the least. My staff and coworkers get people to hang out with. Everyone get to go home to someone that love them when they fail and get comfort from that. I do not get that. I am alone, and i have always been. The joy i get is from making other people happy because i cannot make myself happy. I want to make these people never have to feel how i do. It is just so fucking unfair that thing just seem to work out better for everyone else. I do not know what to do, i do not know where to go, and i do not know how to be happy. This is the worst it ha been. Usually i go home for a bit to take my mind off things, or can occupy my time with video game or something to take my mind off things. Nothing is fun right now.

"Can people stop telling me that hiking and exercise is the magical cure? It just frustrates me so much, and continues the perpetual cycle of well if I cannot make myself better through such simple action I must be even more of a failure than I realised .

Where do I find the energy to go for a hike when being awake for three hour make my body physically ache?

On the advice of my doctor, I have tried it, even walking. I do walk, every day, no matter how I feel. I also do not need to lose weight and being overweight is not the reason I am depressed because I am not overweight . Just saying to stop preaching the exercise mantra a if it is the only thing that could possibly fix what is a very real mental illness that ha nothing to do with how often I move, flex or jump. My point is that it is not working.",0.28578000000000003

"Abnormal I am so used to being depressed and anxious I am amazed how people can act normally in general. I am like how do they do it? I am so used to feeling uncomfortable in my skin that it normal for me to feel awkward and weird in social situations. The fact that people everywhere do not have to deal with this everyday and just can be themselves without breaking a nervous sweat blow my mind. I feel abnormal and tired of it. This is the part people do not understand. I have met shy people and they are effective communicator once they get over that initial hesitancy of speaking. When you are overcome with social anxiety, depression, and feeling of incompetency it damn near impossible to speak or want to. Every word you utter to someone is misinterpreted because half the time it not heard or not what you meant to say. So frustrating I cannot explain it but it killing me. How I feel and how incapable I am in saying what I feel.",0.5032399999999999

"I am new to the forum and this is the most interesting thread I have found so far. I am in my mid fifty and have suffered from depression for a long a I can remember. It is got a lot worse lately. I have been an underachiever because of it, but now I have slowly lost just about everything. I have been on Prozac, Effexor, etc., and I am now on Zispin. This latest one make me sleep a lot. I could not get up for work even if I could hold down a job. I have gone from being a successful business man to losing wife, estranging my kid and grand kids, I am unemployed, out of money and running out of hope. It is time that depression in men wa seen a the problem it really is. How many of u are performing so far below what we are intellectually, physically and emotionally capable of? It is not just a personal problem. It is a problem for our family and friend and I believe it robs our society of a lot of valuable people.

"Hi folks, I have only discovered this topic after making several previous post I am from a traditional Asian culture, but now half-westernized on migration to Australia since age . I have had a long history that stem right to my parent history before I wa born. To cut it very short, my father ha schizoid schizotypal socially withdrawn personality traits, and my mother ha dependent traits, so they basically had a loveless marriage common in my culture . There is a long history of parental quarrelling and physical abuse on my mother before and after I wa born, some of which I heard a a child to early teens. I wa seldom exposed socially growing up, and I had few school friends. I wa also born a quiet person, but this and lack of socializing made me a withdrawn kid. When I wa about , I believe I experienced one psychotic episode I isaw caped grim reaper at that time , since which I have no further experiences. I experienced a few bout of depression during secondary school, for which I did not seek help because of my shyness and parental cultural stigma that wouldepression doe not exist thankfully my family ha ditched that attitude now . During that time, I had many suicidal thought and attempted suicide maybe time but did not tell anyone about it. A very terrible incident also happened towards the end of high school - one night, I physically assaulted my father while he wa quarrelling with mom, and he wa hospitalized. I got charged with assault, but no conviction wa recorded after I did psychotherapy for anger control - that wa also the only therapeutic contact with psychological psychiatric service I had until very recently. That incident, although I felt numb through that time, ha been scarred into my memory - I can still recall the events, and my conscience is still wrecked over it, though I continue to fight it and let it go. At school, I wa a top-end academic achiever in science and math. I wa named dux of the school on graduation. Upon entering university, my depression became worse mainly because of increased social isolation. I wa still shy and withdrawn, I lost contact with my high school friend they also saw me a weird , but I wa also a bit narcissistic towards them at some time - I think it wa an unconscious aggressive reaction towards them , and failed to make any lasting friendship with university peers. One year into university, I started studying Medicine, which I am still doing at the moment. However I felt that course had over time did not improve me, though I did make few friends. I still felt unable to socialize with peers, even though I wa in constant contact with them through many lecture and tutorials. Even though I wa an average performer, I felt I struggled heavily through the year with study. Late last year, my depression hit a new low - my parent had another quarrel, and I wa studying psychiatry which forced me to realize the extensiveness of my past and current problems. It wa another awful time - I lost a lot of self-confidence esteem, became more withdrawn. I ended up failing my first practical exam but still passed given my past satisfactory academic record - the faculty put it down to lack of practice, but the truth is because of what I experienced leading up to the exam. In this year however my depressive bout became much worse - my few friend had deferred, and I wa left with no friends, despite still knowing the others by name . My experience during this year wa largely negative - I felt harassed by teaching doctors, peers, being looked at a a weirdo and excluded from conversation and their social outing whether this wa a valid view, I am finding out now by resocializing with them - my main aim at the moment . Over the last month I had about more depressive episodes, and attempted suicide times, again nobody knew about them. It became a frantic situation - I approached the faculty dean for help, but he only recommended me a psychiatrist, who he wa supposed to contact before I contacted him. However that psychiatrist wa not notified, and I felt very angry about it and thought that nobody wa out there to help me. In retrospect, my view wa unrealistic - help only exists on a professional level, something I knew long before but did not acknowledge at that time, making me upset. My depression faded away a few day later. A few night ago, I had a short dispute with mom, got upset and this eventually led to me joining this forum after a quick search on the net. Why am I writing this intro? Several reasons. I want to tell my story to others, and feel this is a stepping stone to encourage myself. I also want others not yet aware that depression can affect ANYONE, even the best of us, even those involved in the medical profession up to of junior doctor suffer from depression, and up to have attempted committed suicide . I want to improve my own situation - most of all, learning to deal with feeling of sadness and negatively that ha crippled me mentally in the past, and my lack of sociability which doe not help my situation. I know deep inside I am capable of pulling through, of being able to live a normal healthy life because I am aware of my problem and have the power to deal with them. Finally, although I am still a student, I believe my position is privileged and that I should use what knowledge I have learnt to help others a best a I can, something I will be bound to by Hippocratic Oath on finishing school. I am grateful that such a forum exists for others and me to express our thoughts, experience and feelings, and that there are people out there who devote themselves for such causes. Thank you all.",0.37418

The bar we went to is dead on Thursday night though really packed on Friday and Saturday night . It wa nice, though -- we had the bar to ourselves. About people showed up, and after talking to u for awhile, the owner said he would give u drink special on Thursday night if we came back. He even comped a lot of our drinks, which wa cool.

"I have just now realized now, after year of experiencing it, that what I have suffered from is depression. Soon after that, I spoke to my dad about it, and learned he would been on AD is for over year now, and he said he probably could have used them from the time he wa about year old on. He also said my paternal grandmother is side of the family wa all just like u my dad and I are almost carbon copy of each other, except he is always seemed much more perfect to me than I am. He also said my oldest half brother is also on AD is. I also talked to my oldest daughter who is year-old , and she said she is been on AD is a few time too. I can say also that I learned many year after his death that my maternal grandfather experienced severe depression before I wa born. He had shock therapy multiple time it seems..but I do not know if his problem were entirely from the extreme horror he experienced in WWII, or a combination of that plus other problems. When I knew him he wa always a sweet loving, rather quiet, man and my favorite person in the world other than my dad. My dad said he never associated my problem with depression of course, neither did I , but now it all clicks. I wish I would known all this when I wa younger, that depression had not had the stigma it had back in the s s, and that I could have gotten treatment back then. Of course, if I had, I would not have the same life I have now, so I guess I cannot complain about that and honestly would not change a thing..I would not risk losing my kid or what I have accomplished, no matter how crooked and difficult the path a been . But I will definitely watch my young kid now for sign of depression especially my year-old daughter, since she seems to have a similar personality to my dad and I . If I see it, they will get the treatment they need immediately! So in that sense I think this is a blessing..knowledge is power.",0.0
"I posted here sometime in December I think.

I wa actually put on Zoloft for about a month but taken off of it to try other thing b c that wa not doing the trick either. I am back to thinking that it is all in my head, I am now on b shot but those are not doing anything either. I feel like a zombie, I have zero energy and zero motivation to do anything. Even the simplest task like styling my hair seems like a huge chore that I just want to put off. All I want to do is sleep all day.

I only have about two hour of class per day and no job so I have ton of free time to waste away. I analyzed what I did in the past hour and it basically went like this The entire time I wa talking to myself non-stop, analyzing things, analyzing my situation, thinking of motivational quote etc.. I tend to do that all day. For about minute I stood around leaning against a wall, the next minute i leaned against the television, then I went and lied down for a while all while still thinking and analyzing thing in my head, then I came on the computer to just look at random, pointless things. And that is pretty much how most of my time is spent, I might spend an hour or so just standing around or sitting doing nothing but thinking or daydreaming, that cannot possibly be healthy and I obviously have way too much free time, I am just not sure if this is what is in turn causing all my fatigue and sickness.

"I began to openly discus my depression to my friends. It wa very painful to discus but I think it is a step in the right direction. Up to now, I have never discussed my depression with anyone besides my husband and my therapist. I have slight PTSD from when I wa kid and a teacher had been concerned for me by some disturbing behavior. I felt even more misunderstood and felt so much anguish that I became really good at disguising my depression. I hid it under a fake, likable, version of myself because I wanted to fit in and feel like I belong. Currently, my closest friend are my coworkers but they the most judgmental people I have known. We became close by commiserating together at work. Fast forward a few years, I am finally starting to feel better after seeking help for my depression. I have been seeing a therapist for over a year, began taking antidepressant two month ago, and have been taking cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. As I begin to feel better, I also feel more miserable hanging out with my friends. I decided to be more open with the people around me about my depression. I revealed it today for the first time with one of my closest friends. It wa incredibly scary for me.. I have not felt this vulnerable in a long time. My friend typically see me a a guarded person with a hard exterior, but I felt tear welling in my eyes. He wa very surprised to hear, but I am not the first person he know with depression so it wa reassuring to know he did not think I wa some sort of freak. He also commended me for taking step in getting better and encouraged me to continue talking about it. It wa a positive experience overall. I then decided to tell another friend later in the day because I wa feeling good after the discussion I had earlier. It went a little differently though.. His first question was, what do you have to be depressed about?! which instantly flooded my mind with negative feeling of remorse. I tried my best to keep calm and answer his question honestly. I explained that it is not any thing or anyone that is making me feel depressed. It is a mental condition I have which cause me to be in a persistent state of sadness and worthlessness. He asked me if I understand where Eric is coming from his bipolar nephew that he sometimes mention , and I said yes. He then seemed to become more curious and asked me many question about what it is like. In the end, I feel like I educated him on depression and hopefully helped debunk his belief that depression is just a feeling that people should be able to snap out of. I honestly do not think I could have these conversation if I wa in the state I wa even a month ago. Even today, I felt myself slipping into the familiar downward spiral. I do not know what kept me composed today, but I am so proud of myself for making it through the conversation without snapping or becoming defensive. Perhaps if I had these conversation in reverse order, it could have been a completely different experience. I hope this inspires others to talk about it, seek help and be open to receiving it. It wa quite uncomfortable but I am happy to create an opening for other people to understand what we are going through.",0.26849

"What is the point of coming up if you are gonna go down? I moved to a new city with the love of my life after year of loving him. I wa ready to propose, I looked at rings, I called jewelers. I debated getting a ring of meteorite, you know? He is super nerdy, super cute. Science geek and all. I would like to think every guy buying ring think about the meteorite ring haha. Then he tell me that he feel like a she. I loved her no matter what. I told her I still loved her and that she is going to be one of the most beautiful girl ever. I still planned to propose. I loved her more that she is her true self. Then my heart get broken. She tell me that she cannot see a future with me together. She tell me that she is only interested in women. There wa not much for me to do but respect her true feelings. I could not force her to love me. For a few week I lost my best-friend and my future. We still lived together, music helped, weed helped. I made friends. I tried to be happy, and for a little I think I really wa okay. But it wa so stormy, one tip of the scale and I wa back to being broken. Then I find out that she is seeing other guys. My heart wa gone, the only feeling is that feeling when your heart drop to your stomach. It is a little harder to swallow, did life get harder? Did she make it easier? I do not know. I wa not good enough for her. She say otherwise. I know she mean the best for me with her heart but man, did it hurt the same. I ask her to give me time, a a roommate, a a past lover, give me time to heal before you see someone. Please, just give me some time to heal. But she could not wait. I do not blame her, she is discovering herself. She is beautiful. I never had a chance. There are better men for her. I am broken, the piece stomped on. I try. I go to work. I exercise. I eat healthy. I tell myself improve for yourself and no one else . It is a lie. Life seems to drag on, I try to smile, I miss my best friend. I try to act like everything is alright to her. She cannot be seeing me like this, it hurt her too. I meet a guy. He is cute, a little simple, but cute. We start to hang out, workout together even. He take me to some of the most beautiful places, I try to swallow my doubt and bring my heart back. Somedays, I could swallow just fine around him. When I wa sure I wa ready, I told him. It wa too late. I took too long. I wa just dead. I made plans, wrote good bye letters, planned that my little sibling would get what money I had left. I know it is selfish, I know it can get better. I even tried to find a program that sends email at a certain time so everyone could get a good night sleep before they received my letter. I could not do it. I stood on the edge of a bridge, the edge of a cliff, wore my favorite clothes. Listened to my favorite songs. Every time I could not do it. You never think of it a someone being brave. But I wa scared, I could not imagine how anyone took that step off, pulled the trigger, kicked the chair. They had to be brave. And now, I am back.

"I willingly admit that I am a sufferer of depression. But in my case, I think the problem wa education more than anything. I recognize that I have been depressed pretty much from a far back a I can remember. I am not sure where I got the misinformation but I spent most of my life believing that it wa just me, just life, you know, the thinking that some people were lucky and happy and I just wa not. I am now so it is a wonder that I made it to this point, considering the statistics. I think that I tried to destroy myself in other way like smoking and minor drug and not taking care of myself. Basically I wa waiting for thing to either get better or finish falling apart. About a year ago, my new doctor recognized the symptom in me and offered me help in the form of Zoloft and some counseling which changed my life. The problem then became that I changed job and lost my insurance with no hope of COBRA so I actually went of the drug cold turkey highly not recommended, believe me and am now back where I started.

I have tried various medicine for my ADD and the last one I wa on wa Effexor XR, usually used to treat depression but can be used for adult ADD, I wa on it for a year or two and kept increasing the dosage b c I wa not seeing enough results. The medicine dosage got too high and I had a break down during the summer of . To vent I would cut myself and eventually attempted suicide in a Kroger parking lot.

"What a great topic!! The news always make me cry - and I end up turning it off shortly after I start watching it - why do I punish myself? My parent know that I have learned to not watch the news because of the negative effect it ha on me, so if something really important is going on, they let me know. My Aunt suffers from chronic depression and delusion, and I have had numerous conversation with her on how to handle the depression because she is tried so many different things, even going to Mexico to see a Shaman. Her top suggestion and I really go by them a much a I possibly can are Get proper sleep - this is probably the most paramount point get proper nutrition and do not watch the news. The one thing that I absolutely cannot tolerate is sad news about animal - that really sends me. When I am flipping thru channel and happen upon Animal Planet and the Animal Police are busting people because of their cruelty - I have to turn it immediately. I think I am delusional too in that I choose not to watch the news, animal stories, anything really unpleasant - I guess I try to live in my little world without negativity or sadness. I know that it is not very mature or adult, but this is my coping mechanism. I do find that when I hear or see anything sad or awful that my negativity really get into gear, and then I am completely negative for awhile. Driving is also incredibly difficult because I commute into Washington D.C. from the suburb and traffic is awful. I become so negative about the other driver around me that I end up hating myself over my thought about them! They, of course, drive too slow and are idiots. I need to find a job close to home! I too have sometimes felt that the human race need to think about not populating the world anymore. I would not want to raise a small child in this environment any more! I am glad my son is in college and he is the only one that I could have. But then again, I cannot wait until my sister or brother ha kid so that I can be with them and spoil them rotten. Crazy is not it? I have taken others suggestion in this thread and have tried to make myself think positively the last days. It is difficult but possible! I notice that my mood ha brightened somewhat too. Thanks to you all for this thread, a I think it really can help!",0.21577

"I am in a state of emptiness. Recently, I wa in a relationship with someone who did not love me, but I loved them intensely. I had hoped eventually she would turn around, but for that time, I found deep meaning in her. Now it is over, and she doe not seem to care. Meanwhile, I am in hell. It is like the past four year of my life were just a dream. I feel humiliated, used and defeated. I feel like I have nothing. I lost my job, stopped going to school, and wa forced to move back in with my parents. I feel like a total failure and completely worthless. I feel like I am being punished by God, and there is no way out. Even in my dream I cannot escape the pain. I cannot see the good in anything anymore. Everywhere, I see pain and suffering, with no hope. Even when I meet incredible people who am in awe of, I feel almost envious, knowing that I am a worthless, useless nothing in the presence of angels. I still have some friends, but have grown distant from them. Seeing their success, no matter how minute, just reminds me of my worthlessness. I have nothing to offer the world. I am without purpose. Even when I have enough thing to distract me, my ex is still in my dream or nightmare every night. Before I met her, I got my life on track, wa kicking as in school, and headed for something. I know I cannot blame her, but I just feel so stupid for getting caught up in her drama for no reason. What a waste. I do not know. I have been reflecting on my life a lot. I am and have nothing to show for it. I feel like I have to make drastic changes. Liquor and drug are not doing me any good. I do not know what the hell I want anymore. I am so lost, sometimes I do not even know if I am really alive. I feel like right now, I have to settle for mediocrity and hope for simple low - stress job that pay the bills, but I do not have any source of joy or anything really to look forward too. I have pinpointed that the major source for depression and life problem a been my self-hatred. It manifest itself in many forms, including obsessive feeling of inadequacy and incompetence, paranoia, being overly - sensitive to criticism, feeling worthless, hopeless, and giving up too easy because of those feelings. Where did all this self - hatred come from? I do not want to blame my parent at my age, but I know that how they treated me when I wa younger affected me and it still lingers in my psyche. They always employed the shame approach to parenting. Anytime something happened, my father would curse at me, and lecture me on how worthless I was. He would glare at me, and I just had to sit there and listen. Sometimes I would start crying, and then he would yell at me for crying, and say shit like look at you, you are not even ashamed. Shame wa apparently a virtue. My mother once told me when I wa that she wanted to have a third child, but because I wa such a disappointment, she decided against it. They hit me frequently, with a bamboo stick. I remember they would constantly compare me to their friend is children, praising them and ask me why I could not be more like them. So all this happened, but I cannot change the past. I do not want to dwell and blame my parent for their mistakes, no one is a perfect parent. I just want to get over these feeling of self - hatred and get my life in order. I have identified the source of my depression, but have not been able to change all those feeling and thought-processes that have been ingrained in me since early childhood. Does anyone have any advice on how to overcome these feelings, and gain a sense of confidence and direction back?",0.29384

"I am year old single black mother and I have been struggling with depression ever since I wa a small girl. Throughout the course of my life I have had a lot of share of ups and down parent divorced in , father wa on drugs, domestic abuse, severe teasing, idiotic boyfriend and the list go on. If there were problem in the home, you dealt with it at home and kept your mouth shut tight. There is no such thing a a black woman being depressed. Black woman MUST keep this aura of being strong, independent, swallow your tears, raise your children, take the blow that life throw at you and keep moving with the beat. If you did not keep moving with the beat, then you will fall through the crack everyone see it and you will be considered a weak and no one will want to deal with you. Everyone around you will let you have it and you will be labeled a an outcast among your fellow black sister and brothers. I have had a few suicide attempt and my family thought that I wa just trying to get sheer childish attention a to say, I am a big baby, pay attention to me. They took it a a joke and it broke my spirit down to a trillion pieces. I constantly worried what my friends, co-workers, class mates, and lover would see me a a walking disaster waiting to happen. At the time, I did a good job of covering it up for a long time. It painfully and slowly came out. I wa afraid that if I told some one that I wa severely depressed, I would not get the love, support, and care that I needed family labeled me a CRAZY .

"Need to talk and I have nobody. Hey all. Just need to talk, really struggling right now and trying to dig out of it. Not really sure what else to do. Pattern of behaviour Wake up in the morning with immediate feeling of depression and loneliness. Acute feeling of being alone in bed, uncomfortable. Become compelled to flip through Bumble, Tinder because I feel a need to try and immediately correct the problem. I never and I mean never match. Have to fight urge to immediately abuse addiction like porn and weed. Sometimes do, sometimes do not. Prepare for work, fight off feeling of sadness about ex-girlfriend and situation it put me in. Fight the urge to blame her for the failure of the relationship even though I logically know I am wrong or that is not fair. She just left to pursue school and had to move on, she did not do anything to me. Fight feeling of rejection and feeling of inadequacy in my value to others even though there is no reason to feel that here. Walk to work, continue to fight with anger issue re relationship and validation. Sometimes frustration stem from lack of work success but more often than not it is physical appearance issue and relationship issues. I get caught in a loop being mad at her and being mad at myself and my capacity to deal with being alone. Auto-pilot at work. Able to do job easily, so lack of focus is a non-issue. I spend too much time on Facebook and other social medium looking for outlet to expand my social network and friends. Find it very difficult to do so without appearing over-anxious or creepy and new opportunity rarely prevent themselves. Sometimes Imarket business and contact client potential clients. Sometimes a boost come from having success here, but often the lack thereof is equally esteem damaging. Go home, usually bus. Already tired. Immediately engage addictions, usually beer and weed. Start watching TV or playing game and rarely stop until bed time. I will leave easy task like cleaning dishes, etc for weeks. Continual evasion of solving problems, instead opting to rely on substance to either forget or balance my feeling of sadness. Occasionally I have friend over, but many of them use substance a well or are in similar life situation so finding solace in these encounter is limited. Furthermore, they are my friend of many year and represent a kind of social stagnation. At night I am usually in bed by , not because I am out of thing to do, but because I am either drunk or bored. On weekend I am lucky if I do anything outside of what I do immediately after work. I rarely feel compelled to do anything. If I get invited to a bar, I end up going and feeling alienated from everyone and out-of-place . Most of the time, I just feel too tired to join my friends, but I also feel a lack of motivation because I am sure it will just be the same crowd and it appears their life keep moving while mine doe not. I am behind on adulthood. I have only recently acquired a driver is license, I just renewed my glass prescription and only just started living on my own. I have to get my teeth taken care of and they are a source of stress and physical pain still have wisdom teeth at . I have the habit of a teenager. I smoke copious amount of weed, I drink daily and I do not pursue my interest or goals. I know the right course of action most of the time, but I actively ignore it because the amount required to get healthy is just too much. I have spent a great majority of my life single and most of my relationship aside from a few gem have been tumultuous, emotional rollercoasters. More often than not, Despite all these thing I feel undervalued in my society. I think of myself a smart, funny and confident in my skills, but I feel that the rest of the world doe not care and doe not see those a appealing. I feel like without look and an academic education, you can only accomplish so much and that people is standard are so high that competition for a good role in society is unlikely. I feel unable to compete when the above issue prevent me from succeeding. Motivation to do anything is lowered by the lack of acceptance in general, the feeling that I should be acceptable the way I am but am not, and my inability to seem to control that situation. It doe not help that on the face of it, most people will tell me that I seem like a catch , an incredibly high-value person with lot to offer except that none of that seems to translate to my life, emotional attachment or stability.

"Failure to trust nothose on my side . possible trigger Warning I find myself incapable of trusting my spouse. I have been with my SO for nearly years, married this year, we have children. Before I hit my mid-teens I would been through nearly a decade of sexual abuse within the already dysfunctional household I grew up one, with an alcoholic father and a narcissistic mother. I met my now spouse when I wa . He had been in a two year relationship with a girl a few year his senior, which left him broken after her infidelity. And I well I lived day to day, carrying what I could. I will never forgot how I coldly and factually told him with a mere two sentence what I had to endure, telling him that if he did chose me, he would be settling for a lifetime shared with a woman with severe ups and down due to her limited mental strength. He convinced me to go for it and I wept in his arms. That wa probably the first time in my life someone did not look the other way and I allowed myself to be vulnerable, instead of distant and cold. I opened myself up to him. Few year later my home situation imploded. I ran. His mother took me under her wing, I think she wa the first parental figure I could lean on in my life. His father loathed me a the girl from the slums, threatening me in private to never marry his son. Reminding me of my lowly descent when he could. He would never come to accept me fully but at least fully respect me in public, which to me is commendable enough. Afterwards I started living with my now SO, still during our teen in a studio. The idea wa triggered and pushed for by me a a solution after a bout of infidelity on his side after he moved to study in a city a couple hour away. He partook in intimate relation with a girl he knew from another country over webcam due to loneliness and held the act in the same regard a watching porn whereas I did not. We tried to work thing out. As we did my view of him started to crumble, but wa rebuilt after living together surprisingly worked remarkably well. We grew more towards each other and were best friend on top of lovers. In between this life changing chapter and where I am now, he ha had a few strike I simply can not forget. While I wa once open to share my ups and down and sadness with him, now I would rather not. Because where I once trusted him to hold me, I now trust him to ridicule me and tell me to man the fuck up. And the stubborn as I am, I do, but this come with resentment. But to explain the strike - One is where I wa cry after having particularly bad and involuntary memories. Annoyed by my state and stressed by upcoming final he asked me When is this going to end? You are always spinning the same old tales, you are driving yourself insane. - Another wa when he screamed out while we had visitor How would you like it if I told everyone you were raped? He believed I had done something utterly despicable, blame wa pinned upon me by one of his siblings. In that moment something broke, the attack wa unwarranted. So much trust lost. When he figured out I had done nothing to him the apology came swift and numerous. - One wa when I asked him for a letter. He will always buy flower on special occasions, which I hate. They wither and die. I just hate the sentiment, I dislike it and I have communicated this. I wanted something which lasts. A reminder. All I wanted wa a letter. Years I secretly yearned for one but received flower instead, which I still tended to. Finally I asked for a letter. He refused and told me point blank to my face he would not. That it wa silly I needed something to hold onto, and that this item would become something of an unhealthy obsession. - The latest strike wa after I endured a panic attack while I wa on my own, which I managed myself before he returned home. He wa upset when I confided in him and he stated I will not be on your side if you are mentally ill. I will choose our child and make sure they grow up with stability. Later he corrected himself and stated that if I wa to turn schizophrenic or manic, he would have me committed and divorce me, but would support me through depression and anxiety . Now to me a panic attack is something manageable if you are equipped to deal with it. Through the year I have learned to be aware of my surroundings and trigger and to be prepared to deal with anything since I am responsible for my children. I have no history of hysterical or erratic behavior, so I found his reaction to my first ever panic attack very crude. I have my pride even through my depression for what I have survived and what I have accomplished. But I hate that I can not find it in myself again to open up towards my spouse and more than often find myself cry when I am capable to, so I can put up my smile and brave face when I NEED to. I have successfully faked it till I made it. And of the year that we have been together the good by far outweighs the bad, something which can not be conveyed well enough in this post. But what ha been said can be never taken back. Even though recently he said Do not you understand after year I am on your side? I understand. I hate that I cannot be vulnerable anymore. I hate that the trust is gone, and the resentment grows. If anyone ha advice or a similar story of lost trust, I would just love to hear and talk about it, if only to gain some perspective.

I have gone day without talking to anyone I just got out of a bad relationship recently. But I have a issue with dependancy. I let him dictate my entire life. I let him into my head to the point I feel brainwashed. I hate everyone. I do not trust anyone. I do not want to talk to anyone because I know he will get mad and be jealous. He is the closest and only person I have in my life and even though we broke up he want u to remain best friends. We dated for year and it wa Rocky the entire time. But I let him get his hook into me and I cannot get out. I am terrified to not have him in my life because then I will be truly alone. I do not talk to anyone else. I am year old and I have friend other then him. I am terrified of being alone. But he is seeing someone else now. She is time better then me in every way. She is super model gorgeous and everything that me and him shared she ha a well. I feel replaced. But I do not want to not be his friend and not have him in my life. I am terrified to lose him. I cling to the hope one day he will want me again. I have not talked to another person in over a week. and if he is busy with her I do not talk to anyone at all. I just lay on my couch staring at the wall and having a constant never ending panic attack. I have sever depression and severe anxiety that I take medicine for both. But they only make the feeling bearable and do not take them away completely. I do not sleep. I just want to throw myself at every fuck boy on dating apps just to have some kind of physical attention even if it is only sex. Even if I am not attracted to them. I do not care. I just want someone to love me. I want someone to hold me and make me feel not alone. I do not know what to do. I feel like I have been kicked in the chest. It hurt to breathe. I made a noose and stood on a stool with it around my neck for over a hour the other night crying. But I could not do it. I do not know how to go on living.,0.37742

"I wa wondering what people is viewpoint are on for being on medication .. because it seems like getting the right combo of medication seem tricky and if you do not get the right combination, you still remained depressed .. or worse than before? I am curious to know what the myth .. v non myth about antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, etc? Do they make you feel worse? They say that the medication generally make you feel more like yourself than different .. but it take some month to get attuned to them? Is that correct? I have been trying to fight off my depression for over year - I think it is a factor from childhood abuse. In recent years, perhaps my nerve have grown thin .. and I am slowly wearing myself out .. my friend have recommended more therapy since I see a school counselor once every two weeks. But it is difficult to really focus on my emotion health when I know that I will be relocated in two month .. and I feel that my current emotional stability is just shaky.. Is it advisable to start medication without therapy and then when I relocate to wherever I find a job .. then begin therapy there?

I had skipped work today because this dream wa too good to just let the alarm clock interrupt it. I have been able to hold onto my dream a lot lately. Such a I can wake up and roll over and fall back asleep in the exact spot in the dream I left off.. Now the dream is I am at some party. The room is very lavish looking. And everyone there I know. Feels like this party wa somehow for me. Never ha ever happened. Now the part that stand out is that I see my teacher who wa my mentor she wa everything to me. When I wa in high school I not only had this HUGE crush on her but she wa the kind of actor I had always wanted to be except I wa willing to die for my art. Still am. She is sitting with her two kids. They are probably the most gorgeous kid I have ever seen and she ha not changed. Her husband is in the distance somewhere. I never see him but I am aware of him. I thank her for all her time and effort she put into me and I ask her how it is going with her life and if she is still teaching. We talk about something else and the dream slowly fade away.

Like thing just happened to them and fell into place. This could not be further from the truth of my experience. Nothing ever just happens organically. Either I try hard and fail due to my lack of intelligence, or I do not do anything at all. It is hard to stay happy after constant failure and social rejection.

I will never be that person because I do not even know who I want to be, and if I figured that out I would be too insecure to become that.

Why do I have to be so broken and dysfunctional among everyone else? I am not even a real person. I am a complete shell of what could have been a person. This is too difficult to come to term with, while impossible to argue against. It is true. It is my reality. It honestly just make me angry, bitter, and jealous of others, at a very deep, fundamental, human level, for what the healthy people have. I fantasize about taking two AR-s and unloading on people. Maybe I know them, maybe I do not, it would not matter. Often life completely lose their value when my headspace get dark enough. Not a the result of an illness but of the fact that I am who I am both physically and psychologically. Blind rage. That is what the result of my dysfunction is. Pure fucking anger at both the world and myself. Unable to cope with my grim reality, all I want to do is destroy. The only thing I could ever really destroy is myself. The thought of my life slipping away becomes more attractive by the day a I see how impossible my desire are and how completely fruitless any effort to change is sure to be, just like it always has.

"Today is gonna be tough I have been doing okay for a bit now and have not really been in a slump for a couple week but today I cannot help it. Been thinking all of last night about it and now I am pretty torn up. By no mean am I a traditionally religious person. I believe in a god, Jesus died for our sins, and all that good stuff. But I do not walk around preaching and forcing what I believe onto others, instead I try and be humble. I am really struggling here with my depression here a I write this out on my lunch break at work. I do not know if I can make it through today. I just got to thinking last night and a few day before at this point, is it faith or apathy? I just do not really care about anything anymore, not for a long time, many years, in fact. I have always run my life according to my faith. God will provide, God will meet me half way, be thankful for all that I have. I am not struggling with my faith or anything but why am I still around? What am I looking for? What am I waiting on? I am by no mean struggling with my faith but rather where doe the line cut off between having faith that thing will turn out versus just not giving a shit about anything hoping thing will turn out? I do not know, I guess I just want to lay down for awhile. Dream it all away. Pretend that life is not bearing down on me or that I am happy. I just want it to be over. All of it.

"I feel like nothing work or will work out, can someone relate? It is always like I try something and want to better myself, have high expectation and then life comes, uppercut me, spit on me and just scream You thought, bitch . I had a really good therapist but she suddenly quit due to illness. I had to wait several month until I got the final answer. Had no therapy in that time between and also we only had like sessions. Now I have a therapist who is ok but I just do not vibe with her that much. And I cannot change because of insurance. Nor do I have the money to pay for one myself since I am a broke as student. I told her once that I do not want solutions. I want someone to genuienly understand me. At first she tried and now it is all solution again. Try this, try that, we need to experiment . I get the thought but I feel like my deep down feeling are just irrelevant once again. My first therapist really understood me and listened. I could cry my heart out and afterwards I felt so much lighter. I really miss that feeling. Now it is just an obligation I have to do. Back then I never used to come late to my therapy session because I really looked forward to it. But now I am constantly running late because deep down, I just do not want to go anymore and give up. I do not have energy for that. I also took anti depressant Tianeurax if anyone know that one . At first it helped me, especially with processing feelings. But then I turned super suicidal and had mental breakdown over mental breakdowns. I completly stopped and now I feel numb again. I want to feel suicidal and emotional again, to be honest. At least I processed something. Now I feel empty and dead inside once again, like how I used to be all the year before I started therapy and taking anti depressants. My new therapist asked me what I can bear more. My suicidal state or this passive suicidal state. I told her the last one. But honestly, I want it to be the first one. At least I felt like a human. At least some people cared because they were afraid I would do something to myself. Now no one cares. I am alone. I do not go outside anymore. I am just isolating myself again. No one really talk to me and I am just a bother to everyone. I honestly think about taking my anti depressant again, just to get suicidal and off myself. Despite often being a bad actor, I am just so well at playing this role of Of course, I will try! I will do my best . I am good at pretending nothing bother is me and everything is fine. I am good at pretending to say Wow, your advice helped me so much, thank you for listening! . But I am just a fraud. Nothing helps. Afterwards I just want to die more. Sometimes I ask myself, why the hell do I even put up with all of this. The only reason why I have not killed myself yet is because it would financially ruin my family. I do not even care about emotions, I doubt it would be that bad. No one like me anyway. Just so they do not get into debt with my death or sth. I often find myself also thinking that I will never leave a goodbye letter or tell them goodbye. Because no one care anyway. I told them many time before why I want to die. I do not feel like anyone deserves that anyway because they do not put a much energy into me a I put into them. Whenever I feel like it go up, it just crumbles down. I really do not know how much of this I can take. I have been like this since year old. I am now. I do not know why I got thrown into this world when I am ridden and infested with mental illnesses.",0.31141
"You do not have to read this, it is just a short story. A few year ago i wa in love with a guy, we were in the same course at school. I got so nervous every time I saw him. However, he did not say a word to me. He ignored me. He did not even look at me. I did not want to ignore him, i tried to get his attention, but i just did not manage. It frustrated me. I just did not understand why he deliberately ignored me. I wa so down, I started cutting again, did not eat for days, .. It lasted one year. The whole year he never said a word to me. Not even when my sister died. I do not understand it today and I never will. I never will forget the pain. However, i do not blame him for ignoring me. Everybody ha the right to ignore me. But it hurt me so much. And today I always get the feeling people ignore me. And when people i care about do so, it is horrible. Maybe they do not deliberately ignore me, but i always think they do. For me it is the worst thing you can do to a person. It is worse than hating somebody. I wrote a poem for this guy, it is not good, but i want to share it. Do not blame me Do not blame me for thinking of you, because you just do not know how i feel You never knew me and you never will, but i know you so well, yes i do. Do not blame me for dreaming of you, because you just do not know how much it hurt You are so far away, but you are in my dreams, there i can reach you, yes i can.

Why did not you tell me you were going to see her when you told me you were out with your friends? Why do I still forgive you even when you keep fucking up? Why do I love you so much that I did not mind if you do not love me a long a you were by my side? Why did you even tell me you would make it up to me and gain back my trust when you do not prove anything? Why do you keep telling me so much lies? When were you ever sincere to me? Was I a rebound? Are you happier with her now when you used to tell me she never made you happy? Did you get what you wanted now? Is that why you left me? Am I the only one dying here? While you enjoy yourself when we only broke up yesterday? Did I really meant nothing to you? When I thought you could love someone like me because I cannot even love myself. I depended on you and you destroyed me. I gave up everything for you. My dreams, my friends, my family, my time, my efforts, blood, sweat and tear for you. Maybe it is just my fault for not being good enough. Maybe I wa not pretty enough for you? Maybe I wa right.. she wa irreplaceable after all. I knew it.. no one can love me. I am not mea not to be loved. I am so capable of loving someone so much but that person is always not capable to give the same love. My heart ha been torn apart again. When I trusted you so much with my fragile heart. When I prayed to god you were not like my previous ex. You became like him.. except you were even worse. Why promise me thing that you could not keep? Why tell me that you love me when you never did.. I just hope that all the memory we had together, at least just one tiny part of it wa sincere.

Most people in these community do not see depression a an illness, but rather a an excuse for being lazy or unmotivated. There is almost a macho type mindset that you are not supposed to talk about those bad feeling and that shit really sucks.

Did they ever think that i do not want to talk to them? My mother is like a roller coaster ride you cannot wait to get off of. One day she could care le that i am sick, or that i need to tell her something, and then the next day she is all, talk to me, tell me what is going on. God it can be so annoying. i know that i have a problem with my emotions, i just cannot seem to control them, when i am upset, stressed, angry, sad. There are always three thing that i do. First i cry, then i scream, then i run to my room, and sometimes i might knock something down. And that get me another, what is going on talk. Two year ago my grandma died. We were not that close and i think that is part of my problem. every time i try to go to sleep i just lay there and think about my life, and realize, there is not that one person, you know, everyone ha one, that one person that you can just call up and say, hey, i am in a bad mood, can you talk.. or hey i just got in another stupid fight with my mom, do you have time to talk to me.. and maybe that is what is wrong with me, i do not have someone to vent to so i keep it all inside. i mean i try and find way to let my anger and frustration out like, i am a poet, sort of. Everyone tell me i am at least, but what they do not seem to understand is that maybe i am a good poet because i have nowhere else to let all of this out. No one can see that, no one can see that i need someone to talk to. i try and talk to my mom, but she is so busy, and that is not her fault, it is not like she is ignoring me on purpose, she ha school, she ha work, she ha my brother is wrestling match, she ha a meeting. then i try and talk to my friends, and i know that they would listen and they would try and understand, but i do not know, i just do not feel a though they need all of my crap on their shoulders, not that you do either, who ever is still reading this. i guess it is that sometimes, i feel ignored. i turned sixteen this year. Happy Sweet Sixteen..right? i wanted to have a party, i wanted to go out and have a good time. But that did not exactly work out the way i had planned. At first i thought that my friend had forgotten about me, no call on my birthday, no card. And then they threw me a surprise party, nothing big and fancy, just small, just the four of us, the way we like it, but still it felt weird, it just did not feel right. i am supposed to be driving, i have my temporary permit, i have had them since October, you know how much i have driven, about one hour. i could have gotten my license last month, but i cannot go to driving school until i get more experience, and i cannot get more experience until one of my parent decides to let me drive. They used to take my brother out all the time, they would let him drive everywhere. i do not know, i just feel like sometimes being the middle child and the only girl i get ignored. i am a cutter. i tried to tell my parent three time that i wa a cutter and i wanted to stop. i could not tell them in word so i wrote them a letter, they never read it. you probably think i am some selfish person, but i just have been holding all of this inside of me for three month now and there is more down inside of me, i just need to slowly let it out.

I started them for anxiety mostly so I am surprised that I am relapsing so hard into depression. I just wish I did not exist-- eh, better yet I wish I did not have to participate in every day life. I do not know what to do. I used to have so much motivation to finish my college work and now I have none. I have final that start tomorrow that I have not studied for at all. Like, not even a little. And somehow I do not care. That is just not like me. I am exhausted from putting so much effort in all the time. I exhausted from being stressed all the time. I do not want to keep doing this. I just want to sleep. And to think I have four more year ahead of me. I do not know what I am going to do. I already feel like a failure. I keep thinking that maybe I could find something to take my mind off thing but I have no hobbies. I do not enjoy anything any more. Not even eating, which I used to love probably too much but hey. I want to lie in my floor and watch the day pas by me. I do not want to have to keep trying. Another thing is everything and everyone irritates the living hell out of me now. The smallest thing sends me over the edge into my spiral. Three week ago if I spilled my coffee I would have laughed it off. It happened the other day and I cried for hour and wa so angry. Three week ago I wa better than this. And I am crashing all of a sudden. I do not know how I am going to study for my final and maintain my GPA to keep my scholarships. I am fucked probably. My therapist is not that great and I have not seen her in awhile and I do not have money to go back to her. My psych appointment is not until late January, after my medical procedure. I just want to be happy and have some motivation for fuck sake.",0.332
"I am Mark, this is my first post on here. I am feeling really scared of myself at the moment, I have been depressed to some extent for a long a i can remember, and have had many hospital admission in the past, but for the past few year life ha been manageable, I have been in a relationship, not a very good relationship but one that helped me feel safe, i stopped overdosing and cutting, the relationship a i said had it downside i am not sure love is the word to describe what we had but it wa a strong feeling whatever it was, and now that we are no longer together i realize that whatever we had wa stronger than anything i had before. i am so lonely and have very scary thoughts, you see my partner ha moved back to his home country a he had no choice he wa living here illegally, the day we were together before he left i started to have very disturbing thoughts, i even thought of killing him a it would be easier than living without him!! that is very scary. now that he is gone all the old feeling i used to have about myself and the hatred i have for myself is showing again, he wa my protector, my distraction i suppose. but now i do not have that i feel it is only a matter of time until i do some thing really stupid. i have not acted yet a i do not what to have a failed attempt, i am not sure i want help, that is why i am looking here first maybe after this rant i will understand what is happening a bit more, maybe not. all i know at this point is i would rather not be alive, not sure i want to kill myself but i do not want to be alive, do not know if that make sense",0.278
"I am so mad at myself. Angry more like it. I truly hate myself right now. My wife and I are currently separated, and it is all my fault. I know, I know, wouldo not blame yourself . Well, the truth is that it is all my fault this time. I did some pretty terrible thing to my wife and family to make them leave. I also opened my mouth when I should have just kept it shut. I said some pretty stupid thing over the past year plus. I had become some sort of monster, and did not know what to do. When it got found out about, I told my wife that I wanted her to take the kid and get away from me. Why did I do that? I love my wife very much, and do not want to lose her. I just do not know how to express that to her. I am so angry that I just want to hurt myself. I do not care how or what happens. I want thing to go back to the way they were before I started having my problems. I just want to shout and hit something or someone. I wish someone could help me. I am seeing a therapist, but I do not know if it is helping. My mind is still a jumbled up mess. My life is even worse, and I do not know what to do to make it better. I feel so down and out of it. I cannot sleep, I do not want to stay awake. I do not feel like eating at all. I just do not think I care much any more. What good will it do to get my life straightened out if I do not have anyone to share my new life with. I have been so unhappy and depressed for so long, I am not sure I even remember how to be happy. Why do I feel this way all the time? I am so unhappy all the time that my wife think that it is her that I am unhappy with. Honestly, I do not know any more. What is wrong with me? I see all these happy couple walking around, and here all these happy Christmas carol being played on the radio, and I get very jealous. Why cannot I be happy like that? Why could not I be happy with what I had? I had everything that I ever wanted, a loving, beautiful wife, two great kids, and one more on the way. I should have been the happiest man in the world. Instead, I screwed it all up and lost everything that I held dear to me. What kind of idiot doe something like that? I just needed to rant a little. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

I mean, what kind of reaction one expects from post like this? I realize that op doe not really want advices, he just want to vent and I admit I have done the same, but honestly, did I feel better? Did I feel better after I realized other people are suffering with me? No. Maybe if I told a friend, to my brother that I am feeling like shit, maybe, I would feel better,but to unknown people on the internet? What they tell me is worthless. I do not need to feel comforted or understood, I need help from people and receiving advice on how I can improve my life or story of people feeling better. Something which is really lacking on this sub. I want to feel better and I do not care about intellectualizing my pain or feel comforted.

"There is a genetic weakness in my family - virtually everyone ha been on medication at some time, or is on medication now, for depression and anxiety disorders. It seems to onset around puberty. I have had a truly horrible time over the last year supporting my depressed daughter now aged and, more recently, my year old son. I have been taking mg of St John is Wort once a day for about a year, but I am aware that the gene are kicking in, and I am now quite ill in my own right. I really do not want to take prescription medications, a I have seen the horrible side effect that my daughter and son have experienced a the medication have kicked in - she ha had to change medication once a she reacted so badly. Just from looking at the size of the St John is Wort pill available, it is obvious that I could take a much higher dose. Does anyone know anything about dosage, and whether it would be better to take dos throughout the day rather than just once?

I forget appointments, I forget item at the store, I forget how to do things, anything that can be forgotten, I forget. I do not mean to.

However, it is being interpreted a apathy, especially by my parent they have had enough of repeatedly reminding me to do things, and I am an adult, and they need to concentrate on THEIR life and what THEY need to do, particularly to help my thirteen-year-old sister blossom now.

She ha a significant other. Soon after, she would not talk to me at all, and she avoided me. All of her friend told me that I should not have done that because it wa a bad thing to do. I just wanted to tell her that I wanted some space from her, so I could no longer have feeling for her. Since then, all of her friends, have treated me with aggression and insults. I get dismissed every time I am around her and all of her friends. This ha launched me into another Depressive episode. I wa yelled at by other people and ostracized.

"It is been a while since I have written and I decided to start off again with a bit of a bang. I am going to post my story of beginning recovery, this is to try and cheer some people up and to let them know that they could do it too. Well now, where to start.. About a year and a half ago the beginning of Grade is when I started to notice the changes. Not physical but emotional. I had been told many time that this wa very normal for teenager so I thought nothing of it. There wa an incident with a rather immature and nasty young man, who I just happened to have an ENORMOUS crush on. Anyway we both kind of lead each other on for a while but nothing happened, than he meet this girl at a hockey game. He immediately started talking about her all the time and how he really loved her so much. I began to feel more and more useless. After that I started rolling down hill like a circle of cheese, and by March of that year I wa quite close to suicide at several occasions. This is when I started noticing that this might not be normal and tried many self-help methods, all of which failed. I thought Grade could be a new beginning, it wa not. My grade were starting to slip and I just could not be happy anymore. Finally after a close call in December I told my mum all about my failed attempt and how I wa feeling. She agreed to get me a new doctor. I visited her and I got diagnosed with depression and wa prescribed Cipralex. Of course that took a while to work too which involved me missing a lot of school, falling really far behind, and having several more close calls. Finally I started feeling a little better and wa even stable enough to start going back to school and going to visit my family in the East. Well I just got back from that trip and I have never felt better. I am ready to face the world. That trip wa just what I needed. When I get through these next week until my birthday all I can see is a varely clear path ahead! For the first time in a year and a half I can concentrate and tolerate le than perfect circumstances. I hope everyone here will feel this way, you can if you just push through! Power to us! Rock on!",0.31239

Times I thought about driving into a bridge abutment or into a truck at the last second. Absolutely crazy stuff. I can now see what wa so logical at that time to be so desperate from too much pain suffered by the abuser she was. I can now see the so called glimmer or hint of a silver lining in the most simple of thing life offer to everyone each and everyday. Thank God .. finally. Things will get better and hopefully someday great. I keep trying remind myself thing could be a lot worse. Two great healthy kid who love me and miss me terribly. I am their entire world. I now realize that. That alone ha kept me here . Realizing now that I have been lost in that vortex of hell tugging at me for year .. I actually want to keep going on to life is next challenge. That spell hope and progress in itself. I have made it this far after going through hell with her .. why stop know when thing are just starting to look up I do not want to go back into that dark hole that life wa for far too long.",0.596
"I am having suicidal thought He chose someone else over me again. How can someone be so heartless? He had no concern for my feelings. He just cut me out of his life by saying he never loved me and wanted to be with someone else. How do you recover from that? I am so angry. It ha gotten to the point of me having suicidal thoughts.

"I am and fighting with my depression for almost year now. I had psychosomatic problem all the time. Until July, I wa on medication with SSRI selective serotonine reuptake inhibitor which helped me a lot but never completely and then for some month none. Now I consulted another doctor and decided to try with different medicine called Remeron. But my question might sound not related .. I somehow think that contraceptive pill antibaby pill that I used somehow contributed to my state of art . I used them for month because my gynecologist advised she thought that I had some problem with hormone she did not even check my blood! and when I stopped with this therapy I experienced total breakdown of the system .

"I do not particularly want to go into detail about how I have been feeling the past couple of years, only because it is too much for me to go into, and I do not want to leave out important detail or anything. In September , I voluntarily admitted myself to the hospital is psych ward through my psychiatrist, the reason being because my depression had grown so severe that my muscle gave out and I could not move anymore, and my will to live had vanished entirely, I stopped eating, I wa dehydrated, I stopped going to school, all I did wa lay in bed all day, it is the only thing I could do. The decision to go to the hospital turned out to be a very, very big mistake, and I regret making that choice. I felt no connection with the other kid there, especially because I wa a week away from turning eighteen, and most of them were thirteen, fourteen, and maybe one or two sixteen year olds. We were similar in an emotional aspect, but otherwise I could not relate to any of them. I just bored them, and the way they talked and the thing they talked about just confused me. I did get involved with them to an extent during the last couple of day there, but I regret that now. This is a story in itself, but I also got involved with a girl there. She fell in love with me, and so did I fall in love with her, briefly. Only because a girl had never shown any attraction to me before, nor did a girl ever show any interest in me like she did. My feeling for her quickly faded after talking to her a couple of time outside the hospital. She turned out to be a real mess of a person. I did not suffer from the relationship, though. I do not talk to her anymore, and I actually became a better person because of it - I wa enlightened. My depression practically disappeared following my discharge from the hospital. I do not know if it wa because of the Zoloft that I had begun taking, or because I wa finally free from that prison. By the way, I do have a form of claustrophobia. I am not particularly afraid of being in narrow or tight spaces.. I am afraid of being locked in narrow or tight spaces. And the hospital wa very small, and they did not let you leave or go where you wanted. You were confined to your room, the main recreation room, and the hallway connecting those two places. The day before I wa discharged, I wa constantly shaking, sweating, and going to the bathroom. I could not sleep, and I wa afraid to move. I had to stay in my room most of the time and skip out on the group sessions. So anyway, even though I felt better right after getting out of the hospital, that quickly, VERY quickly changed. By mid-late October, I wa on home-schooling and will be until I graduate in June this year, I am a Senior in High School , and attending group therapy several day a week, a well a seeing a psychologist once a week and a psychiatrist every several weeks. All of this therapy did NOT help me. I wa feeling extremely depressed and suicidal one night, after a brief fight with my dad I accidentally bumped the curb while parking, he yelled at me to watch the curb, and I got very upset, pulled the parking break, and walked off while screaming about slitting my throat.. , and called one of the therapist at my group therapy to help me. I would locked myself in a room in my grandmother is basement, and I had called her so she could talk with me and help me to relax. Instead, she threatened to call the police if I did not open the door and let my dad in. So I opened it, but after that I completely lost my trust in her and could not stand being around her anymore. Another counselor at the group therapy also lost my trust. I felt a connection with him, and trusted him a lot, so I told him about my girlfriend whom I had met online - another story and he kept on accusing me of things.. like using her for sex, or not really being in love, and etcetera. So after having lost trust in two therapists, and then all sort of insurance problem came up. I stopped going. A few week ago, I stopped going to my psychologist a well. I felt like I wa being lectured by him instead of actually helped.. On top of that, he wa taking weekly co-pay from me while he knew my insurance did not require co-pay for anything psychological! i.e. Counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc. And he still owes me a couple hundred bucks. He also charged my insurance for appointment I had cancelled. Basically, I took two step forward, and then three step back. My depression is not a bad a it wa in September , but I am pretty much tired of living. I am constantly thinking of suicide, and have even written brief suicide note and made plan which I never carried out . My Zoloft ha been at mg for the past couple of months. It is helped my social anxiety slightly, but my depression - no. I am aware of the state that I am in, and I am simply tired of it. My future is all dark, I do not see thing getting better. When I spoke with my girlfriend this weekend, I cried the entire night.. I just could not take everything anymore. I saw a new psychologist last week, but again, I feel like I am being lectured. I am eighteen year old, and being talked to a if I were twelve. It is insulting and make me feel even more left out of thing than I already do. I do not know.",0.0

"Hi, I am new here and do not know where to start, where to post or anything. I do not know what can help me, but I know that I do not like my self, and I am unhappy most of the time. I am not currently on any medicine cannot even do that right and have never really been tested or diagnosed with anything other than depression. I live my life day dreaming of what could be and what should be..I am a year old female and my problem started when I wa born. I wa born to an alcoholic dad whom I loved and a mom who did the best she could whom I love a well. My whole family wa in therapy from about the time I wa year old. Our family therapist doctor wa Dr. Love, I am not kidding that wa his real name. All kind of thing were going on in my family that I wa not aware of until I wa grown. One wa the fact that my real father wa sexually molesting my older half sister..I wa labeled a bad child out of control child and wa locked in my room for hour at the time which wa what our doctor told them to do..I would not cry when I wa punished or spanked and my mom would have to stop my dad from whipping me to keep him from killing me I suppose. I wa the youngest of children, real sister half sister and one half brother. Although after I wa grown I found out that my real sister wa only half too.. I wa very creative in a strange kind of way while I wa locked in my room. I would open my window a scream for help with my tape recorder on, so when I got tired I could play it back so maybe someone would come..we had big metal blind in the window and for some reason I would raise the blind all the way up and tie the string to my door knob when I would go to sleep at night so the blind would fall if anyone opened my door.. Crazy huh?? Any way, when I wa about year old I wa put in a foster home, you know cause I wa a bad child. Then I went to group homes, back and fourth here and yonder. Never tested for anything..never medicated..I wa back and fourth from home, foster homes, group home and mental hospital from the age to . During one of the time I wa gone my parent divorced, and my mom moved to a new house. I had met a guy during one of my short stay home, and thought that he wa my world. You know by then I thought no one loved me, except for him. He wa my world. My oldest sister told me that if we got married I could not be sent away any more. She knew how it wa being at those place in the is and is..I mean if you were not already mad you would be..So I married the only person in the world that I thought loved me..As soon a we were married, I got pregnant. He cheated on me, controlled me, I could not even go outside without him beating me. He would come in from his girlfriend is house and if I said anything about it, he would go off and throw thing and call me every name in the book, take aerosol spray can and a lighter and throw flame at me until I wa in the corner begging and cry for him to stop. He beat me in my stomach and said he hoped I lost the baby. He said if I ever left him he would kill me. I had to get stitch over my eye where he busted it. Of course I lied to the doctor..scared for my life. All of this went on for a year, when my daughter wa born he wa not even there. His parent had to go get him out of his girlfriend bed..I wa young and dumb. I thought that everything would get better now, I mean he wa the only one in the world that loved me. Things got worse and when my daughter wa week old he got in one of his mood and wa beating on me and his grandma. That is who we lived with. He went out in the yard and took an axe to all the car and his dad came over to stop him. My husband took the baby out of my arm and held her over his head in the street and threatened to drop her..that is the day I left him. His father called the police and had them come get him. Then he called my mom and told her she had better come get me and the baby if she did not want u dead. He said that he had got my husband locked up for now, but that it wa his son and that he did have to go get him out. So my mom came and helped me pack up and leave.. That is the first chapter of my life..it doe not get any better..but it doe help to tell all on here. I will tell more later. I need to go to sleep for a while and pas some time.

"One of the biggest thing i am struggling with besides my depression duh is finding a good therapist. I moved about month ago, and I have not had luck finding a therapist that I can work well with. I know that I need help with cognitive therapy, and i have gone to a couple therapist who have cognitive listed a a specialty, but when I get into therapy with them, it all talk therapy with little to no help to me. Do not get me wrong, talking doe help, but I know from my year of dealing with this illness that I need some good solid cognitive therapy to help me to overcome my lack of self n worth self n esteem confidence.

"I have had quite a few life situation that have probably contributed to depression.. I grew up in an emotionally sexually abusive family..but the type of abuse that is just over the line enough to mess with your head, to make you wonder if it wa really abusive or if you were just sensitive. I still talk to them and see them at times, but vast quantity of thing go unsaid. . I left home for college, and almost immediately wa recruited into a religious cult where I stayed for or so year I just got out a couple of year ago. . I had my first major depressive episode while inside and although I found a supportive therapist, she too wa in the cult and therefore some of her advice at time wa influenced by their beliefs. Also I wa alternately shunned and ostracized, rebuked harshly, or encouraged to give up medicine therapy by various member in various level of leadership in the cult. . I very recently switched job to a much better job situation, but am still adjusting the environment. . We are in contract to purchase a home, which is great, but also an adjustment. The Question. My psychiatrist think I have been depressed for most of my life. Which make sense when I look back over my journal and look at various thing I did, said or experience. Thing is, to me, depression a a state of mind became normal. I did not know anything different than how I wa feeling. So what happens is this I mention something I have been experiencing to my therapist. She is concerned and asks if I have brought it up to my psychiatrist. When I do bring it up to my psychiatrist, he says, Why did not you mention this before? To which my response is I did not know I should. Translation I thought it wa normal. Right now I am on Effexor, with Adderall XR a a booster plus synthroid due to a nasty run in with lithium. When I started I wa okay. Great even, minus the utter exhaustion at the end of every day. Lately though I have been feeling..things..that I cannot describe. Sadness..but a feeling bigger and diverse than the word sadness can contain. Tired..but a tired with an emotional component. Feelings I do not have word for, but that pierce me to the bone. And that are not connected with anything in real time that I can think of. Is this normal? Deep strong feeling that surface out of nowhere for a time and then dissipate..usually on the weekend when I do not have work to focus on? Not feeling much of anything in between those times? Being vibrant and full of idea yet calm and productive first thing after I take the medicines, but gradually fading to sort of numb, definitely tired, somewhat negative by the afternoon with exhausted, sink into the couch with the remote, hit the bed for a nap by , sometimes pm? How do you know what is normal if abnormal ha been normal for you for so long? How do you know when it is time to have a sit down with the psychiatrist again?",0.32413000000000003

"I wa rejected amp I feel great Last night I asked a close friend of mine on a date and wa rejected, but strangely enough I do not feel dejected but rather proud and accomplished. To provide some background, I will be turning on the th, and last year, just day after my th birthday, I wa diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder. This disorder is characterized by long lasting, essentially uninterrupted period of depression lasting AT LEAST years, and in many cases, such a with myself, far longer. To provide a rough estimate, I have been depressed somewhere around a total of year of my life. The depression ha had a serious negative affect on my love life, at time making me cold and even cruel. The most egregious example of this wa when, after having dated this girl for a few months, I stopped talking to her almost entirely and started flirting with other girls. Eventually she had to get her friend to break up with me on her behalf because I wa refusing to talk to her. At the time, because of the depression, I thought little of myself, seeing myself a a worthless scumbag, and so I started acting like one. I wa also afraid to open up to some else, so instead I became emotionally cold and avoidant. I hated this behavior in myself, and held a deep guilt for how I had treated woman I had been with, so about year ago I stopped dating entirely. Despite being rejected, having finally had the confidence and self respect to ask out a woman and accept the no graciously is a major growth in my self esteem and wellbeing, so having done so I feel a great sense of accomplishment. This ha really helped boost my self esteem and confidence, even though I wa rejected. There is no real point to this story, but I just wanted to get this out there, because I am really proud of the progress I have made so far.",0.36419

"How to deal with people who cannot seem to be bothered with you? Question is fairly self-explanatory. I ask this because recently within the past or so month , my supposed friend have started to become quite distant with me and it is making me feel like total crap. They rarely ever contact me despite me having reached out a couple of times. It is all very fragmented. What hurt the most is I see them interacting with their other friend on facebook etc. and also that they have been online recently but still have not answered my messages. My friend used to be great, they used to consider me their closest friend and would reply quickly etc. But now I feel like I have been replaced and I have nobody left. Even back when I would hang out with them, they would be on their phone talking to these other friend of theirs and I feel so hurt. Being alone sucks. No matter what, I can never seem to make friend with anyone new. The majority of other people my age are living it up, but I cannot seem to do anything with anyone apart from my family. I feel like I am missing out on something. I feel so unwanted to the point I have started deleting all my social medium to isolate myself even more. It is beginning to eat away at me and my depression is coming back, a much a I hate to admit it.

"Hi. I am new, and I am not really sure where to start in the forums! I have been treated for depression since I wa year old, and then misdiagnosed with ADD when I wa and that started a downward spiral with abusing Ritalin snorting about - time my dosage for about years. That is over with. I battled with anorexia a a direct result of the Ritalin, and got down to lbs. Then I ballooned up to lbs. I lost lbs. a few year ago and I have kept it off ever since I have never gone above . I have been on Prozac since I wa , and just recently switched to Cymbalta at the suggestion of my psychiatrist. I felt funny on it, and committed the ultimate sin I stopped taking my medicine a week ago. I know that is bad. The last two day have been a nightmare, and I even contemplated swallowing a bottle of pill at one point. My fiance is the most amazing person in the world, and I am literally killing him with my sickness. I do not know what to do. I have been hysterically cry and inconsolable for about a week. Yesterday my fiance called the psychiatrist on-call with our medical program, and she said I needed to take the Cymbalta, so I did take one pill yesterday and again this morning. I do feel weird, though. At the center of it all is my weight gain I gained about ish pound I weigh at the moment , and NONE of my clothes fit me. I feel like a disgusting fat blob all of the time. Just one look in the mirror set me off and I am HYSTERICAL for the rest of the day. All I want to do is sleep. SLEEP and never wake up.

My clothes do not fit and I feel fat and disgusting and horrible and I want to cry and rip out my hair. I am thinking this weight ha a LOT to do with my recent downward turn in my depression, but I just cannot lose the weight. I work out constantly and follow a really healthy strict eating plan, and nothing is working. I am just reaching the end of my rope, here. And to top it all off I am getting married next month. I need help..I have called my psychiatrist, but I do not know what to do. I do not see a psychologist I think I need to, but I have had bad experience in the past.

"Struggled with depression and anxiety for year and made it through Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my experience with depression and anxiety in the hope it might give someone else a reason to keep going. I am new to reddit, so I hope this is okay! I have struggled with severe depression and anxiety for the past three year and it is honestly been the most difficult thing I have ever dealt with. Mental illness is silently crippling. I have spent more night than I can remember wracked with sobs, feeling incredibly alone, and fantasizing about suicide. I have spent more day than I can remember feeling hollow, being apathetic, and not caring about what happened to me. Depression is a fucking bitch, and even now, when I actually feel happy and loved and excited for my future, I am not naive enough to think that I will never have to struggle with my mental health again. But I think I have learned how to best cope with it. Medication did not work for me, and while I do believe that professional therapy can be invaluable to people struggling with mental illness, it did not make a big difference in my case. But I learned to focus on the present, to rely on loved one I am lucky enough to have, and to forgive myself. Take it one small step at a time. So what if you could not leave your room today? That shit is fucking hard! You got up and you got out of bed, that is the first step. Learn to love yourself even through the despair and self-loathing. There is no one path to overcoming depression, and sometimes it is not exactly the cure-all you envisioned but rather learning to live with it. But I promise you all that one day, it will be better. You will be happy again. And until then, I am happy to listen to you if you ever need anyone to talk to or have any questions.",0.29763

"Tired of being lonely but there is not much I can do about it. I just want to feel like there is someone to talk to out there but, no one in my life ever want to talk with me about anything except to yell at me or to tell me to do something. That is the extent of my daily social life. I could probably go a month without saying anything or talking to anyone and no one would even care or notice, I need social interaction like anyone else, but what do I do if I cannot get it? I can interact at work ok, but that is not really the same. Online interaction is not really the same either.",0.24938000000000002

I am a prick for not posting for so long. But, lately .. okay not lately.

Yeah, so unfortunately, this ha taken up a lot of my energy. That, and I am poor.

Do not I have enough guilt already? Sorry the funny is lacking, kiddies.

Hi. My name is Jenna. I am year old and just joined and figured that I should introduce myself. I found this site from searching online and think that it is great. I only started accepting the fact that I have been depressed last year because I have always been very good at hiding it from everyone else and I used to fool myself a well if that make sense . I have never been one to seek help from others because in the past I have always dealt with everything myself. The start of college and being outside different state of my home environment which is the cause of a lot of anger and resentment that I also have helped me to see that there wa something wrong with the way that I wa living and that I could reach out and get help. I am currently seeing a counselor through my college and since I feel like I am working well with her that I do not need to seek other outside help yet about my anxiety and depression but I feel that talking to others that are going through the same thing could help give me a different view on everything and be helpful a well. I am glad that I stumbled across these forum and I cannot wait to get to know some of you. Jenna,0.19211

"I checked myself in to a Mental Hospital I decided after dealing with month of annoying suicidal ideation that I should go to a mental hospital. I say annoying because I wa aware of these increased thought and wanted nothing to do with killing myself. While I wanted a closed environment away from home stressor to solve my issue I wa also afraid of going somewhere unknown. I went through with it despite cry and feeling emotional on the way there to get my life turned around. I feel very often that horror story are told of hospitals. In reality, if you need the help, please seek it out. You may have a completely different experience than someone who claim they do not remember their stay and wa drugged up to their eyeballs. My experience wa a pleasant one overall. I went there and focused on fixing my issue and I would say I came out feeling better. I am not sure if I can or should give the name of the place but I am sure someone can let me know down below. I just want to share my experience and help people not feel so afraid of going to one. The place wa pretty clean. An adult area for people and over, room and hall split by gender. Bathrooms only seemed a bit off towards the end of the day or during the morning when people would shower. Roommates were sweet and tidy thankfully but the option to change roommate if there wa a problem wa always available to me. Groups were informative and engaging a well a encouraging for others to speak up if they wished. You had a good amount of personal time to do whatever. Outdoor activity were available permitting the weather. The place wa meant for short stay of up to a week so anyone who is still there for longer may see the group a too repetitive. The food wa surprisingly delicious and great. Honestly expected school lunch type of food but there wa variety and option for those allergic, vegetarian or needing gluten free food. There were staff member around whenever you needed them for anything. The treatment team could have been better. They were good to me but not to everyone there. Changed med without informing me. I went from to to mg of Abilify. Good Lord I felt it once I wa home. Then REALLY felt it when they made a mistake and I went cold turkey for two week because I could not get my prescription filled. I will update once I am properly back on it. So that is my experience. After a week, I came out feeling better. I got off of Wellbutrin after determining it could be the cause of my increased depression. The Abilify give me energy to get up and not be stuck in bed all day. I feel better than when I went in. I know this is a long post, however I have been afraid of sharing my experience with others. I do not want to feel afraid of ashamed of having went, so here I am with this post.

"First of all, a happy Christmas to one and all. My situation is that I have had moderate depression on and off since year old, and year ago aged I had it so bad I had to be off work for months. Then I tried the SSRI Escitalopram and it worked perfectly and I went back to work. I came off it a year ago and then month ago I suffered a relapse and had to go back on it, and now I am OK except when it came back for day after a booze bender . My psychiatrist is saying I should take them indefinitely. As I have no side effect I am happy with this, but I am concerned about some report saying that they start to work le well after some years. Is this right. And if so would not it be better to ration them so I only take them after I relapse? So they keep on working for longer, if not the rest of my life. Is there anyone on the board here who ha been taking antidepressant for many year who ha found they have become le effective and now regret having taken them for that reason. And now suffers depression that now cannot be treated by medication? Yes I have heard that you can switch to others, but surely the same type of reasoning applies? The psychiatrist said that I had endogenous depression with a reactive cause, and that she did not think that counseling would help. Does this make sense? A former work colleague of mine recently said that the antidepressant had made me start acting weird . Well apart from posting on an internet forum I do not think I have done anything weird, and other friend agree with me. But other friend all think that it is not good for you to keep taking these happy pill for a long term, that antidepressant are a short term fix only. But what do they know.

She can be really happy at time then really down. We get in fight sometimes but they are usually resolved. She always complains she is a bad gf because she treat me like shit. I forgive her for doing so because of her shit life. Today we were just talking casually and a few min later she said I will km on said date. Then I told her why would u. She said love u bye. We then went back and forth until I decided to leave her alone. She said she wa not feeling ok. But I have never heard her give me a date before.

I also know or have been told, we all dream every night, it is a fact, we just do not remember them. Since I have been taking medication for depression Effexor and Klonopin , I dream every night! And not just one, several dreams. They are very vivid, most of them do not make any sense but some of them do. It just amazes me how much I dream now and the thing I dream about and can remember! Has anyone experienced this and can it be related to the medications?",0.30815000000000003
"I am new here - wa not quite sure where to start but special new member posting area seemed appropriate. I think I have been battling depression off and on for some time now. I saw a therapist briefly, for a couple months, but had to stop when it got too expensive and when I could not take the time off work anymore. I actually did not even start seeing her until the worst of my depression had already passed. Not sure I got that much out of it, but maybe I did not give it enough time. I wa doing so well for a while, but in the last week or two, I can feel myself sliding back into it. There are certain things, issues, that tend to pull me into that hole. I would done so well at avoiding them, I felt like I wa over it. But I am dwelling on them again, and I do not know what to do this time to break the hold. The smallest thing set me off crying, and I have completely lost interest in the thing I wa so excited about two week ago, along with most everything else. I feel completely isolated - I have no one to talk to about this, which I guess is why I am here online. OK not sure what the point of this post was, but thanks for letting me get it out. Sometimes it feel better just to tell someone, anyone.",0.4325
"What Depression is Like For Me. Having depression is like sailing with a hole inside your boat and only a bucket to keep you afloat. Depression is wanting to have friend but are too anxious to go out and stay a while longer. Depression is forcing yourself out of bed, not for yourself but those who count on you. Depression is having an empty feeling inside your chest while your head is crowded with self loathing. Depression is where people tell you it will all get better but only hearing the silent whisper of the wind. Depression is where you slowly lose your personality, joy, and interest for those thing that you have used to love. Depression is where a stranger tell you I will be here for you and you take it a an insult. Depression is where you hurt, crawl on the floor crying, grabbing on to dear life alone in your dark room with your thoughts, too tired to do anything and then go to bed only to rise again to pretend that nothing happened. To pretend, nothing happened.",0.44354
"hey there depression, it is me, ya boi a letter for u by ur truly dear depression, look, my dude.. i have not showered in a week, and although i bleached my hair so you cannot see how dirty it is when that happens, i can still feel it and would really like to use that coconut shampoo i bought that make me smell like, well, coconuts. i am not sure what i smell like right now, but it is probably not fruit. maybe that lavender febreze i spray all the time, if i am lucky. i have not done laundry in a month or so. i wore the same two dirty pair of pant to work all week - the long ones, because even though it is been around F all week, i have not worked up the energy to shave my leg in forever. like sure it is and girl can be a hairy a they want these day woo go feminism or w e but jeannie from accounting noticed when i had two vaguely different sock bc i wa too lazy to find a matching pair and i do not need to give her any more reason to open her big mouth tbh. i only got out of bed today to pee and eat a sandwich which i thoroughly enjoyed - the sandwich, not the pee.. but maybe the pee a little bit too.. not in a weird way tho - so it is nice to know i can still enjoy things, even if i have developed an unhealthy coping method with food and am going to get fatter and hate my body even more. but hey, at least it is not drug . which also reminds me that i need to do dishes.. or i could just keep buying disposable dishes, so that i can let that pile up in the trash i desperately need to take out instead. i have shit i have got to do that i wa supposed to do last weekend, but also spent that weekend in bed you are terrible in bed btw , and considering that i am writing this at am instead of sleeping like i wa supposed to start doing several hour ago - after i wa supposed to take the med that i did not get up to take - the forecast for today is pretty bleak a well. of course, you know all this, because you like to stop by every couple week and make sure of it. i think you are more regular than my time of the month which would probably be more regular if i could just stick to taking my birth control every day, but we already established that i suck at taking pill that i am supposed to . i wish i could just get up and do what i need to do like a real adult - so many people do it, and on my best day i can even pretend to be a real adult a well. but with you here, lurking around my apartment without even helping with the vaguely overpriced rent, i cannot seem to get anything done. so if you could just, like, leave for a couple of day before i run out of clean underwear too, i would greatly appreciate it. sincerely, a concerned citizen",0.532

I do not want anything, just go to sleep and never wake up, but it will not happen to me.. I cannot control anything. When i eat, food doesnt have any difference, it just fill void called hunger.

Basically what happened wa that a few day ago, I sent my best friend a message before school, saying that I would not attend class because I wa not feeling too well, that I felt like giving up and that, in case I also would not have been at school the following day, I had probably killed myself. I wa not joking. Sometimes I get these sort of impulse , most likely caused by me being overwhelmed by my emotions, my thoughts, and a a result of that, it feel a though I lose my common sense, my ability to think rationally. My thought pattern become unpredictable, but so far I have managed to not act on them, or else I would not be writing this right now. Currently they have been happening a lot more frequently than usual and that seriously freak me out because during those time death seems like such a good solution to my problems. So, back to the story. Obviously, my friend got really concerned and encouraged me to come to her place because she would been staying at home that day. BUT she also contacted my mom, which I did not know until hour later, and told her that I wa not at school and made a concerning remark, but I do not know exactly. My mom started to call me like every minute and I started to panic because I thought a teacher had called her, so I did not pick up any of her calls. I spent the rest of the day with my friend, but called my mom in the afternoon. She asked my where I wa and it sounded like she wa cry and I told her that I wa at my friend place, but after that she declined the call. That night I slept at my dad place, my mom called him and told him that she did not care anymore about what I wa doing and that kind of hit me. It wa the last thing I wanted to hear in that situation. I just do not know what to do. I really do feel miserable. My friend is beating herself up because she think it is all her fault and I do not know, I just feel bad for feeling bad, if you know what I mean. That message wa a cry of help in a kind of way and I do not understand why my mom reacted the way she did. It just make me think that maybe everyone is really better off without me. I have been depressed for nearly five year now, but my mom never really paid attention to it and just marked me down a lazy. I have been doing great for a good six month in , but then somebody really important to me, somebody that kept me going, passed away in December and since then everything had taken a turn for the worse. Life ha become so hard for me, I am sleeping the day away because I cannot bear the thoughts, the guilt, because I am too much of a coward to face reality. I am trying, I really am, but no matter what I do, this feeling, this feeling that eradicates my will to live, remains.",0.3501400000000001
"I guess I am writing because I do not know how to think or feel at this period. I feel that I have hurt a lot of people by having my depression, especially my parents. I have not phoned them in weeks, I just do not have the courage to talk to them. I guess they feel that I blame them for my condition. Same with my remaining sisters. Dang what a situation I have put myself in! I still have a group of friend that like me a lot, but I have not told them about suffering from depression. I hide it inside and either act in anxious way or I do solitary activity such a write poems, play the piano or swim. I guess the main embuggerance is that I finding the third year of my course a real struggle at the best of times, but having understanding tutor and talking to doctor that have depression help. I do not know why thing have turned out the way thing are, why I struggle with anything remotely challenging, but I guess that will never be explained. Sometimes i feel frustrated with the way thing have turned and I can do very little to change the current of of my present situation. I feel kind of sick with stuff at the moment. Not that I am assuming a victim complex, but just that in all the poem I write about, I always seek a sanctuary from the business aspect of life, you know the dog eat dog, go compete with others to get a job and survive for the next year of my projected lifespan. Yeah pretty heady thought I am having! I guess I am just scared of the future. I do not know how to survive, I kind of want to blank the future out. I guess all in all, I want to live a simple life and be decent to others. I would like the people I meet in the future to say hey that Haymond guy wa a splendid fellow who really loved people and would go out of his way to help them, because he could. But than an inner anxiety know that I have hurt people from withdrawing into myself and by depression is virtue being too self indulgent. That hurt the most, knowing I hurt people from my depression. I never intended to harm anyone or be this way. If I could smile and be happy I would, but I can only show the scar of my mental pain a a testament to self torment. Do not get me wrong, I smile sometimes and even rejoice in the company of those friend in normal health, but I guess I feel rejected. Self rejection and by that of the stigma of the people of the same age I encounter on campus and at home. I want this to stop I guess. I want a placebo pill that will transport me to the Elysium fields, because sometimes reality is a bugger to experience. I guess the main message is that I want respite from this life, some form of relief and rest, where I will achieve or obtain this elusive elixir of peace. But I am here, still standing, still finding a lot of life a challenge, still merging into a crowd of people who are too proud to admit that sometimes thing may be too much. Who am I and what am I doing here .. I have not a faintest clue. Yeah, I am scared of defeat, of a battered ego that even a shred of self esteem that I had will be allowed to fly in the fresh wind. Its sound like I am asking for love .. I guess I am. Also that I would love some help, and in no small measure I have requested that help from doctor and therapist and talked to you my dear friends. But I find it extremely hard to help myself, to make amends with the very mind that hurt me so. I do not know what to think is what I wrote at the top of the blog, now seems apt to include it in the conclusion. I guess spilling my emotion ha made me feel somewhat dizzy! I guess I will wander, spinning round in circle until I get what the whole dang thing of life is all about.",0.30711
"My best is not enough. Ok, so here is the situation I broke up with my ex five month ago. As soon a we ended our thing, I started running everyday, eating healthy food only, and going to the gym. hmin of HEAVY exercise everyday. I did this until this very day. I lost fucking kg my weight at the start wa kg, now kg . I also bought green contact lens to wear, and even sunbathe. I invested so much time and money to improve myself and look amazing and no. one. noticed.! I look at the mirror and I am happy with my results. Then, the moment I exit my house BOOM. month thrown into the trash. No one cares. It make no difference. The woman I am attracted still do not find me attractive. It piss me off how I imagine they will not survive just one week of my training. They cannot see how hard I worked to change. I downloaded Tinder,even saw my EX there, wrote a BIO describing myself I still find myself interesting. People, do not and I got nearly matches. Now I am stuck in an Alcohol Cigarette Party OneNightStandGirls loop and I cannot get out of it. I drink so much that I cannot even remember some things. I have fun, yes.

"Driving back home from dropping my cousin off, I began to think about my future actions. I am fully committed to this. I know that when I start, there is no going back. If I do not succeed, if this becomes a botched suicide attempt, there really will be no life after that. My parent will hate me. My friend will leave me or treat me with kid gloves. Either way, I suffer even more than I suffer now. It doe not seem possible that my suffering can grow but I know that if I do not continue or succeed, it will. I honest to goodness do not know what is wrong with me. I mean, why do I have to feel like this? Nothing I have done to make thing right with myself ha helped. Things just keep getting worse for me. Before, I let it go because I understood that the bad need to happen before the good. That you have to have the bad with the good. I kept on waiting for the good. I did not expect sunshine and rainbow but I expected some sort of light, even a tiny bit. I expected a slight reprieve from the evil, dark thought swirling in my mind.

"Here is my answer to your age question. Sadly, I am year old sniffle Do not get me wrong. I do not want to be completely alone for the rest of my life. There is a sentimental part of me that yearns for companionship with a guy, but I have such a tall hurdle to overcome before I can even get to that yet. Yeah, but I can relate to the peace and quiet thing by myself. It really is such a luxury nowadays personally speaking . One thing I reflected on wa that I live in a family of people, and maybe that is why I feel so claustrophobic and irritable around lot of people. Essentially, there is no secure privacy, really. Yup, like you I used to live independently when I went to school. I am on a bit of a break right now, but will go back in September where I will share an apartment with a roommate I do not know. Right now, I am mooching off my parent food and shelter. At age , I feel like a little child. And by the way, I am unemployed too. I tried all summer to land a job, but in vain. I only worked one day for Elections Canada, and that wa it. Oh well, a paycheck is a paycheck, right? The thing is, I cannot stand living with somebody I hardly know either. Sometimes I just do not want to greet somebody at breakfast, or say a polite hello, how are you, or how wa your day? . When I battle depression and social anxiety, I really really need the comfort of familiar people around me at times. The last thing I need is a complete stranger sharing my quarters. But, it is something I cannot help. I will probably isolate myself in my room for a while. At least I get cable TV and the internet. Then again, I will probably become a complete hermit during the school year.",0.25905
"So depressed that I developed disassociation. So I am going to bed after posting thus so sorry if I do not respond right away. I am . My short and sweet backstory is that I lost the love of my life because of alcoholism and depression. The way we broke up wa the worst thing to happen to any person. She basically called the police on her way home from work, had me put in jail for a week on false charge and since I moved out of the state I could not call my family while I wa incarcerated and charge eventually dropped. It broke me so terribly that I literally split personalities. I have the me that stare deep into the darkness all the time and the me that deal with and try to make sense of the aftermath. Every time that person take over I feel a part of me being lost. In a way it u insanely scary that depression can eventually turn into this.

"Depressed? Or Just in a Bad Rut? Long Post I have never really felt like I have had depression before. I am turning at the end of the week, and this is the first time I have honestly wondered about myself. Usually, I am pretty happy about things, and my outlook on life ha always been realistically positive. But, lately, I just feel absolutely lost. And this morning, after I got off of work, I sat and cried. I am not much of crier at all, and the only other time I have cried in the last ten year ha been at an uncle is funeral recently. This past summer, for me, wa a pretty great time. I wa in a relationship with a girl who really made me happy, more than any other one had before. I seemed to be having fun every weekend, whether with her or with some friend of mine or family. I had a lot on the horizon, and a lot to look forward to. I wa getting ready to finish up my degree, and it seemed like thing were going in the right direction. The only thing that wa a problem then wa that my job wa a third shift job, but it wa day a week, and usually - hour shifts, meaning I had time to do stuff outside of it. But, my then girlfriend and another friend had solid connection that they thought could help me land a much better job where they worked, which would carry me pretty well until I finished school. Things were looking up for me. I wa pretty happy. I guess thing started to slip for me when my uncle got hit with a terminal diagnosis in August. At , and with young children, nobody in the family wa prepared to lose him. And the disease, an incredibly rare degenerative brain disease, wa the same one that killed my grandmother year ago. We lost him in early September. The thing with this disease that nobody in the family is talking about is that, if it hit twice within the same bloodline, there is a chance that living relative within the bloodline will get it in their is or is. There is nine of u left in the immediate family, including my mother, my brother and myself. And since it is so rare, there is absolutely no treatment plan. That, for me, wa a lot to process. I am not worried about myself, but the idea that I could still be losing relative to this disease for year sucks. It is hard enough seeing it happen twice. During this time, thing started to fall apart with me and my then-girlfriend a well. I kind of hid out with her for a while, because my family wa perpetually sad and in a state of distress. And since I worked nights, I wa kind of isolated. Things started to hit a rut between me and her when she started her own treatment for depression. I tried to be supportive of her, while doing whatever anyone in my family needed while my uncle wa sick. She really seemed happy that I wa there for her, and thing really worked out since she lived so close to my uncle anyways, and I could bounce back and forth from place to place on my day off. Both my family and my girlfriend were very important to me, and I guess helping them out made me feel good about myself, even though the situation wa shitty. I kind of let school fall to the back-burner though. And I kind of neglected my other friend for a while a well. But between work, my family, and her, I wa consistently busy. My uncle passed in early September, sending most of my family into a pretty bad state, and only a week later, my girlfriend decided she wa done with me, because she wa afraid that if she recovered from her depression with me around, then she would equate me with happiness, and if I left her then she would not be able to recover. Which ended up being mostly a made up way of saying, I do not love you anymore, but I do not have the courage to tell you. Obviously, it wa not fair to her to be stuck with me if she wa not happy with me, but there were so many better opportunity for her to break thing off, and she chose the one that wa the most tedious and mentally draining for me. My state of mind after it ended wa not great at all, and I said some very mean thing to her after it ended, I guess, at the time, I thought it wa constructive criticism, but it wa all just mean and awful and embarrassing. Understandably, she ha not talked to me since, and I feel like I burned any bridge towards reconciling with her. I missed my uncle a lot, but doing favor for his wife and kid helped me at least feel like I wa contributing. My mother is still kind of a mess about it, but she ha my father for support. My brother had a hard time for a while too, but his job keep him well occupied. But, lately, for me, the thing I can help with anymore have been fewer and fewer. Right now, I just want to fast forward to like March or April. I do not want to deal with my birthday, since the plan I had with my ex-girlfriend are obviously not happening anymore, most of my friend are busy with work and school, and my family is still not back to being normal. Nobody seems to want to do much for my birthday anyways, which is, for lack of a better word, normal for me. When I got home from work this morning, I cried thinking about it all. I have never had that kind of emotional reaction to anything before. The only thing I look forward to in life at the moment is my night or two out with a friend a week. The holiday are going to be rough on my family, I know now that my ex girlfriend who I still care for and would probably take back ha completely moved on from me, and the once promising prospect of a new job is not nearly a likely a it used to be. And, school kind of got caught up in the shuffle, and I am not where I wanted to be with that, either. I am going to be out on my own come January, which might help, but right now I am just dreading the next month. I feel like the thing I care about are slipping further and further out of my control, and it is hard for me to deal with. I do not know if this is just a rough patch in my life, or a sign that I have a more serious problem. But right now, I have very few people that I can be open with, and it is been tough. Work is, for lack of a better word, quiet for me, meaning I spend most of my time thinking, and it doe not help much. Since I have never really had a stretch like this before where I have been a mentally drained and just sad, I am not really sure what to do. But there is very little on the horizon that I am looking forward to, and I am worried about that. tlr Stretch of life events, most of which out of my control, have wreaked havoc on my emotional state. I now feel kind of hopeless. Do not know if it is just a rough patch in life, or something worse.",0.0

"I want to share my experience moving to NYC from Israel - four month ago Hello everyone, I just thought it would do good for me to share my experience moving to this city among other new yorkers and maybe hearing some new voice of people who are living here and know better than me or even went through the same thing. So basically, I am year old and moved to NYC four month ago with my wife. My wife is doing her Ph.D. at Columbia University, and I just joined her with a work permit during our stay here , and we are going to be here for at least . years, but we could choose to stay for five year if we wish to. At the moment I do not see it happening I have to say that moving here ha been the most difficult challenge I have ever been through in my life. First, though my English is not bad at all, I am SO, SO insecure about it. I am feeling afraid to open my mouth and say complicated things, and it is depressing me. I am a person who is talking a lot by nature. I have always been like that And I feel like someone took away that ability from me and I am much le charismatic in English than in Hebrew which affect my confidence tremendously.. After smoking weed for - year almost every day in Israel, I quit doing it since the first month I got here only because it made me feel very anxious it used to make me feel quite the opposite before I used to be a teacher in Israel and pretty quickly I have found a job a a teacher that teach Hebrew here in New York. In Israel I used to teach History which I found much more interesting than teaching a language, but that is what I got here, so I have to live with that A few day ago, I had a conversation with my boss, and apparently, they are pleased by my work there, and they asked me if I am willing to continue for next year which is nice to hear even though I do not like this job that much. I guess I will have to compromise. My wife and I are supported by an excellent scholarship, and we do not have to worry a lot about money or health insurance so, on the financial field, we are kinda covered. But being here make me feel powerless. Obviously, I do not have my good friend here with me, and I feel much le special a a person. I feel like I am only one among million who are trying to survive in this big hectic city. In the beginning, I thought it is beautiful that this city is full of people from all around the world, but now it just feel to me that everyone are stranger to each other and it seems like it is the loneliest city in the world at the moment. And because I do not have friend here and I am married so meeting with girl on tinder etc. is not an option I do not have many reason to leave the house and it is kinda sad. The only reason I am leaving my house is for yoga classes, work, and restaurant with my wife. Other than that I do not have any other reason to leave the house.. The weather is fucking horrible, and it is so cold it is painful to me being outside. Anyways, I do not expect from you guy to be my therapist or giving me some life-changing advices.. I guess I post this to release some steam. So if you managed to read my post until the end, Thank you And I hope thing will improve for me. I have always lived in Israel and only left for trips. The longest wa - months, and I have never relocated my life to anywhere else. So maybe it is just a matter of time until I will start to feel more like home here. If you have anything to share from your experience, that would be lovely just to know that I am not the only one who is going through this adjustment period. Thanks again for reading and for your patience. Have a great week everyone",0.0

"Unrequited Love Crept Back Up to Haunt Me First off, I felt the need to create this fake reddit account so that my post could not be linked to my actual reddit account, and I could vent to reddit without worrying that any of my family or friend will read this. Unrequited love is the worst. It consumes your mind almost every second of every day. I am usually a positive person at least I try to be . Grew up with this girl in the church. We were the best of friends. In high school, we went to homecoming and senior ball together. I asked her out times, once in middle school, once in freshman year, and once in senior year, all three time given the response I am sorry, I do not like you in that way. It messed me up. Even affected my first two relationships. I got with my first girlfriend solely because she liked me. Part of me hoped my best friend would get jealous. I genuinely liked my second girlfriend and she liked me. This girl gave me the butterflies, but because neither of u made a real effort to be boyfriend and girlfriend, we did not last. Before, after, and sometimes during each of these relationships, I would wish it wa my best friend I know, a dick move . Then I messed up. I wa influenced by a terrible person to say some thing I should not have. We went to the same community college like we planned but three year passed without ever seeing each other because we were fighting. The time that we spent apart allowed me to clear my head. Before, I used to think about her all the time. Now, days, even week would pas without her crossing my mind. I met plenty of people in college and made ton of good friends, focused on my hobbies, it wa the happiest I have been. Eventually, we got tired of fighting and I realized what it wa that I fucked up an extremely good friendship. After I made an effort to show how sorry I was, she made an effort to let me back into her life. Then I thought, Do not fuck this up. She doe not need you to like her. She need you to be a good friend. I said some harsh things, and because of it, we were not friend for to years. So naturally, we tried making up for the time we had lost. She invited me to hang with her friends. I invited her to hang with mine. We would do thing together, play music together, video game together, and just genuinely hang out. We talked thing over and settled our fight by blaming that terrible person that we both dislike from before. We eventually went to the same university together and some of her closest friend became great friend of mine. We took a class together. Would exercise together. And we have gotten to the level of No judgment a she call it, where I have told her some of my deepest, darkest secrets, and she did the same with me. Problem is, a we spend each week almost always hanging out or day out of the week. I find it harder to come to term with u never being together. She is never dated, but she tell me about guy she is liked, little thing that happened to her like small romantic contact like holding hand . She ha A LOT of guy friend that she is close with, and a few girl friend that she is really close with. And though it only bothered a little back then, it is something I am jealous of now. Each time I see her, I first think to myself be normal, be funny, do not show any sign that you may still have feeling and it works. I am happy with the way thing are, u spending lot of time together, hanging out at each other is house for hours, trying different foods, and just having someone like her I can talk to. But thinking about the guy she who will eventually be her first boyfriend, or her husband whom she may have kid with, that future where another guy becomes the guy she sings with, dance with, go to church with, doe romantic stuff with just pain me to think about. Well, it is late like in the morning and this is the time when I am usually in my feelings. If you have invested time to reading my story this far, I thank you and would like to know what you think about my situation. I am a bit dramatic, and I overthink like a muthafucka, but I am an honest fellow, and this is first time venting to reddit. And it is a bit ironic, cuz I should get some sleep since she is coming over tomorrow. P.S. I thought about solution like slowly drifting apart from her, but I have come to the realization that I would rather have her in my life a a friend than not at all. But it still hurts.",0.132

I think they believed I wa too young to be diagnosed and so I never got a checkup from a psychiatrist after O.T. . So it is possible I am autistic but idk. Anyway my childhood wa shit. Absolute fucking garbage. I wa the loser kid. Had physical issue so I never left the house. I wa ugly and fat. My entire childhood wa just a big fucking waste of time. Anyway I become and start hanging around bad kids. At this point I lost all fuck to give about my schooling. My social skill were finally developed enough so I can make friend but I did not really like any of them. I started getting a prescription for drugs. It wa not very difficult given my medical history. Started taking Adderall daily. And my mom would occasionally give me some Xanax she had. Also started drinking. I guess some warning sign for a shitty life but idk. I am not entirely sure what to do at this point. I plan on going to community college since I am probably gonna drop out of HS soon. I just do not think I am ready for the real world. I always feel like I am that one person who just cannot adapt to things.",0.30929
"I will be on the road in le than hours. The last month ha taken a serious toll on me physically, cognitively, emotionally, and spiritually. Things have suddenly gotten so crazy. Nothing look even remotely familiar to me Aggers, . I have held My Sweetie with tear in my eyes, hoping her to buoy my hope for the future. I have been overwhelmed by the enormity of change and possibility, fallen to my knees, bowed my head beneath our roof, and prayed in earnest that it will not be the last. I have wrestled with the stranglehold of others denial, silently observing time crush their last defense a the flurry of last-minute demands, requests, and desire are left unfulfilled. I have ended my beloved employment, said goodbye to supervisor and peers, returned keys, cleaned out my desk, and stood at the door of my empty office with the first true inkling of the magnitude of what ha become the most difficult life transition I have yet faced.",0.34071
"Hi I am trying to get a grip back on my life. My mental health ha cost me my marriage. My husband just could not handle it anymore. I wa hospitalized five time in April and May for suicidal attempt and thoughts. He wa there every day for me but felt abandoned by me. As he said through tear he could not save me . After the hospitalization I wa really needy. He married a strong and independent woman. In Sept I took myself off my medicine and went into a rage and accused him of cheating on me. That broke his heart and his spirit..he left. Of course, I went into a tailspin. Finally got of the couch last weekend, three month later. I stopped my counseling and medicines. I know I have to get it back together again. I guess looking for support here is a step in the right direction. I am trying to figure out how to go on when you lost the best thing that ever happened to you. Thanks for listening",0.32278
"I am new to this so please bear with me. I do not even know where to begin. With all of the tragedy going on in our gulf coast a well a the war, I feel I have no right to be unhappy but I am . I am year old and have made a complete mess of my life. My parent were raised in Europe and came to the state in their is. I have a younger brother who also ha depression but it differs from my own. When I look back at my childhood all I feel is pain and neglect and I cannot recall any happy memories. I do not believe that I wa ever physically abused however, I do think that I wa ignored and emotionally neglected. Perhaps that is why I manage to make a mess of my life every time thing seem to be going well. I am married and have a year old son. From all outward appearances, my life come across a perfect although we all know there is no such thing . I have been seeing psychiatrist and therapist since I wa and have tried to commit suicide on four separate occasions. My mother suffers from depression and her mother did a well. This is such a long and complicated story and I do not know how much I am allowed to write or if anyone is even interested since this is my first try in any type of chat room. My interior pain lie so far deep that I do not sleep, hardly eat and feel miserable all the time. I guess that is all I will say for now.",0.35704
"Well, I have to admit that a a male I have always viewed my own depression a personal weakness. I still do, I cannot help it ..it is a notion, feeling or philosophy or whatever that is been instilled from an early age. I know this is not a popular or realistic way to feel about depression. I mean, it is an illness, right. I have never been to a doctor to have my condition properly diagnosed or treated. At the moment, I really cannot face my doctor with that sort of issue btw, I am in my mid-s and I have suffered from depression since a long a i can remember - I have learned to cope, in a fashion, but probably at the expense of a reasonable sense of social normality - i.e. divorced, emotionally empty relationships, enormous amount of time spent alone, dissatisfied working life, etc. One cover up disguise the depression at work, at home, and wherever whenever necessary..and then, when you are all alone, the demon can come out to play or even before you are alone - but at least you maintain the expected external masculine dignity, most of the time. For example, today my son wanted to come over to visit me but because I have been feeling so miserable and morbid and soaked in ennui this week, I made an excuse to put off his visit because I did not want him to see me feeling low depressed and weak and thus ruining his day week. Instead, I went out on a freezing mile walk alone to try to physically squash the depression. This is a regular occurrence - I get depressed, I hate myself for being weak, so I do something physical to try to alleviate the symptom and also to punish myself for feeling depressed .. it works..temporarily. In my mind, this sort of masochism is or ha been preferable to taking alcohol, drug even prescribed medicine , fags, therapy or inflicting real self-harm and so forth because, at least, it keep me feeling physically fit-physically balanced and I guess that is important to me even if it is not always an effective cure for one is depression. And I can keep up the public pretence that all is well. Sorry, back to the point - yes, it seems a lot of men do tend to suffer depression in silence one wonder what the real percentage could be! .When I joined this group yesterday it wa the first time I would openly voiced the notion that I DO suffer from depression. Not so macho. Perhaps my condition is getting worse.. or maybe I am just feeling a little more realistic about what it is to be a male suffering from depression. Are there MANY woman or even men out there who are truly sympathetic to male who suffer from depression? Unfortunately, I have not seen much evidence out there so far?",0.42791
"Back to square Depression sucks. I have Been depressed for longer than I could remember. Some day are okay, I could manage to get out of bed and go out. Some day I just want to shut myself in my bedroom, lying on my bed. And then I feel useless and ruminate over the fact that I am in fact useless. Today I feel like absolute shit because the weather sucks. No I am not going out of my home. I do not care if I am running out of food in my apt. I am forgetting all the advice by therapist and wiping out all the progress I have made. I am back to square one. I am such a useless existence on the earth",0.36567

"I think you guy might understand this. I wa walking with a close friend after having lunch together, and I told her, I feel a if I am living on borrowed time. She asked me to explain further, but I could not find the word to better express that perspective. She then proceeded to recount to me all of the myriad way she is nearly died on some of the trip she is taken. I confessed that I could not really relate to those sort of situation or how they have affected her, a she ha more zeal for life than anyone I have ever met. Whatever she wa describing about perceived proximity to death did not suit me. Then the word came to me. I feel a if I am living on borrowed time, because I feel like I could, at any moment, lose what little will to live I have left. It is like I am waiting for the other shoe to drop. I see it in slow-motion, slowly falling to the cold pavement, but I do not know when it will finally make contact. In the meantime, I am existing, trying to experience new thing and connect to people a much a I am able to, but I cannot shake the conviction that I will eventually resolve to leave by my own hand, despite whatever life I have made for myself.

"I have always resented my mom for being emotionally abusive growing up and blamed her for my depression. But I just told her I am depressed and she responded in the most perfect way. I feel really weird. I am an adult now and have had crippling depression since childhood. Growing up, I never had emotional support or love. I wa called name and my mom took out her relationship life issue on me. I wa distant from both my parents. I have hugged my mom only once in my life. This is just one issue out of many that led to me developing a fragile self esteem and crippling depression. Over the years, with distance, we started to talk- like once a month or so. The more educated I became, the more I came to understand why she acted the way she did although I still harbor much resentment I am going through a depressive episode just now. I feel so alone and I texted her out of desperation. I told her I felt alone and depressed and could not get out of bed to study. Instead of judging me or saying something mean..she just listened to everything and all of my symptoms. She said that she felt so sorry for me and she wished she could help me. And she told me to never feel alone because she love me and I am very important to her. She asked if she could do anything to help me..and I realized, yeah, if we could call each other every morning, I could have someone to talk to and tell her about my daily goals. Then I could feel more motivated to get out of bed and feel le alone that day. I just feel weird, because I do not have a relationship with her. I am scared it is going to be awkward, but I am desperate for any support I can get right now. I also still resent her, but at the same time understand. I do not know. It is just weird. But, I am happy she acted this way, for sure. Edit I also do not mean to brag or anything like that. I just wanted to share this with someone, and wa wondering if someone had a similar experience maybe in forming a bond with their parent longer into adulthood.",0.0
"I used to be you It get better You have to love yourself first amp other lie Not even sure if I should post in this sub, but.. To the people who used to suffer from depression, from trauma, from anxiety, from whatever made you miserable, I am not you. You were once miserable, like me, you saw no light at the end of the tunnel, but then, you did not give up. Something happened. Now you are happier, now you have got your happy ending, now you have got people who love you for who you are. But I am not you. You probably changed, you probably were capable of change, were strong enough to change yourself even. I am not you. I have been gone for a long time, now. There is nobody here but bad habit and terrible feelings. Sometimes I feel a semblance of someone who just wanted to make other people happy and be loved, but I think the misery just piled on like mile of permafrost. I cannot blame people for not loving me, but I do blame them for lying to me. Do not they know it hurt more to say I care when they do not, and it take me much too long to figure it out? How am I ever supposed to trust people when they say they care if it is been such a common lie? The worst part is, nobody can prove it, because nobody can help me, because nobody know how or want to , I do not know. I have been asking for help for a long time now but nobody take me seriously. You, who say that I should not give up. Why? I am not you. Years from now I will not be surrounded by people who love me, I will not be anywhere closer to happiness, I will not find anyone who love me. If that person exists, and perhaps they do, I will not ever have the luck to meet them. You tell me I have to love myself before anyone else will. Those who grow in complete solitude do not even learn a human language. So tell me, if there is nobody to show me how to, how do you expect me to teach myself to love myself? I think you just want to place the blame on me. I do not love myself and so that is why I am miserable. Not because of depression, not because of isolation, not because of poverty, not because of heartbreak, it is because I do not love myself in a world that is only taught me to hate and criticize myself. In this world where the people I thought I could perhaps give my heart to, say I care about you and then show me those word are meaningless. Forgive me for being skeptical about getting better when I have only seen my life decline since it began. I am not even asking for pity, because I know it is just the luck of the draw and I wa dealt a particularly shitty hand. But can you please understand that not all of u are going to be okay in the end? Just because you suffered for many year and I have suffered for many year and you no longer suffer like you used to, doe not mean I am not going to continue suffering a I always have been.",0.39123

"I have had depression for at least year now. I have been with my partner for year and in that time i have come to depend on him for a lot of thing - everyday thing like making phone call for me etc. because i find it too hard. In the last couple of months, friend family have seen him out with another girl, they were closer than they should have been, i have also seen it with my own eyes. Since i have noticed this, our relationship ha deteriorated a lot, to the point that we are fighting every weekend, and during the week because he is always wanting to go to his friend house who is this girl is brother . Today, he ha been really angry and agro at me. He ha told me to go away and that he ha been avoiding me on purpose. I feel like if we broke up my life would be ruined. I feel like i need him to survive. Every time we have come close to breaking up, it end up me begging him not to leave. We live together which make thing harder. I have no friend left because i wa so dependant on him and they got sick of me not seeing them. It is easy to say break up with him, but if you understood how attached i am you would know it not so easy. I do not know what to do.

"I went to this meeting. It wa for people who have depression. The leader said to me that I wa so knowledgeable I should be well. I wa very sick at the time. Which went to show me I had knowledge but no wisdom. For year I knew this. I read all the book and nothing changed. I really felt like maybe I wa on the wrong line of thought to get over the depression. Yet I did feel better. I thought my life is not changing though. I have so many hope and dream for my life and here I am sitting around wasting it. I still feel like that at time but then something bad happened and I did not react to it. I did not feel worse. Then someone did something stupid and I did not yell at them. I went to a friend and asked if she thought I wa getting better. Her answer was. Hell Yeah. You bother to talk to me now. It seems she wa doing all the talking at one stage. I did not know. It is been year since I first got depressed In all the test on the computer it went from severe depression to moderate the other day I got mild depression. Ok today it back to moderate. I think the reason for this is that I am nearly there with a thought process and I just cannot get it. I am kicking myself for it for being incompetent and those word from that woman came back you have all this knowledge you should be better. Do I need to go back and do some stuff on self esteem again? Is this what this is about. I look inside of me and see my self esteem ha fallen apart again .. and I mean again! How many time is this? ? a times? Why cannot I work this out? I do not know what is wrong. I think if she asked me now, I would tell her, I have not got all the answer yet. Somehow I wished she wa right. That with what I knew I could just be better. I am off to hit the books. Is not depression ironic? You can feel bad about anything even a compliment. By the way. I am still procrastinating. It is better though. I think. Not that much though I have so much to do. OK that is wrong is not it? I am heading to the quiet of my bedroom to study. I hope.",0.55333

"I wa sexually, physically, and emotionally abused by my father, my uncle and my grandparent from the time I wa five until I wa fifteen. My mother had taken my father and his family to court for it but everyone said that she made me say it to get back at my father, since I wa only five and not old enough to know anything. None of them were punished for it and I had to keep seeing them on visitation until I wa sixteen i am still sixteen and I told my dad I did not want to see him anymore. This obviously did not make him happy and he know it is about the abuse. Every once and awhile he email me or call and try to make me feel guilty about it and when he doe I get upset all over again just when I had started to seem to get better. I really wanted to write a book about my life, but I figured that because my dad and his family wa not punished or proven guilty that I would be sued for it. I want to change my last name and then get a pen name, but my mom say I have to wait until I am eighteen. I do not exactly want to wait that long to write my book, but I feel like I do not have a choice. I have considered taking them back to court but I figured it is probably hopeless and I feel guilty and doubtful even though I know it happened. Anyways, I do not want to put my mom through all that again. A lot of time I think that I imagined it all and deny it because I wish it did not happen. I really want to be a writer and to help people who have been abused, but without proving my abuser guilty I feel a if this is impossible, that it is not my right. I am scared they would be found innocent and then try to kill me for taking them to court. What should I do? I know everyone here is having a hard time and I really do not mean to be a bother.

"Hi everyone. I am a yrold mom of three, and under. My depression started a a teenager, but somehow back then I wa able to talk myself out of it and perhaps had enough going on to keep me distracted. I got married right after high school, and nine month later, overnight, really became a mom. I never intended to be a mom at nineteen. I had dreamed of going to college, enjoying year of freedom with my husband, and then, carefully planning our first child. Well, seven year later, we have planned only one our last , and strangely enough my only planned child wa the hardest to recover from emotionally. After the birth of my first child I struggled with denial over all my crushed dreams, and fought back depression and suicide on a daily basis. I saw a psychiatrist who put me on various medicine over the next few months, to no significant improvement. When my daughter wa three month old I wa voluntarily committed to a behavioral health facility and stayed there four days. I came out fully charged, and within a matter of days, wa right back where I started. So I started seeing a therapist who did me little good, and continued on the latest medicine combination I wa prescribed. Shortly after my daughter turned one I finally gave up on the medicine and the therapy and pretended to be better, even though I wa not, because of the sheer frustration that nothing wa helping so I might a well just get on with life. I continued to battle depression and suicide on a daily basis, and also struggled with behavior that wa contrary to what a good mother should be. My husband wa military, and it is during time in his absence that I have become her , my alter ego, someone who is intolerant, impatient, selfish, and ugly towards my kids. And blah, blah, blah. Do you guy get tired of telling your life story, because I do. I have lost count of how many time I have told it to various therapist in some vain attempt to help them understand me. So let me tell you where I am now. I am a person who is deeply confused. On the one hand I dearly love my kids, my husband, and I have the desire to live life and see my child grow and strengthen my relationship with them and my husband. On the other hand, I am sapped of every last ounce of purpose, life becomes extremely monotonous, and I strain to see the point of it all. Even now, a I write this, I am wondering, why am I wasting my time? These people will never know one tenth of a percent of what is going on inside me. And that is how I have left every therapy session I have ever gone to, feeling like my time wa utterly wasted and like I have made a chicken scratch in an issue solid a ice and twenty foot deep. I balance on a fragile thread of life and death and I am scared that it is only a matter of time before something tip the balance just far enough that I finally do it . My biggest fear is that by the time I find a way to heal myself, if I make it that far, my kid will have paid the ultimate price and be a product of confusion and sadness too. I am sick and tired of trying to feel human. In talking with others, I feel intangible, fake, this intellect in human form but incapable of human understanding. My emotion are real love, hate, empathy, grief, anger, happiness, but I still do not feel real . I feel like I am missing some vital component that tie it all together, and without it, I am nothing more than this body walking around, emulating those around me, operating on some kind of autopilot. It go beyond frustration and confusion, and I feel this pent up rage building inside of me, and I want to scream at the top of my lung until I turn blue, throw a chair through a window, send dish crashing to the floor, something through which I can channel the anger and get it a far from me a possible. And then, sorrow. Black a an abyss, tormenting hopelessness, and it is then that I contemplate suicide. Fortunately or not I will then remember something, some reason for why I cannot do it. The other day wa my sister birthday. I did not want her to have to remember her birthday a the day her sister killed herself. Then I bawl, because there is no way out. I cannot leave, and staying mean continued torment for me and the people I love, and for some reason, love me. How long must I endure this cycle? Once again I am off medication. After the birth of my third child I went on the latest wonder drug, Lexapro, and after a year with no improvement I have abandoned that a well. I also made another mental health check in when the baby now wa a few month old, for six day in duration, and once again came out feeling like a hundred buck only to crash again. I have examined the perspective that, like the book title, Depression is a Choice , and have even embraced the idea. I have also embraced the idea that it is certainly not a choice, and that medication is the solution, with equally unhelpful results. I grow weary of this fruitless search to fix myself . For those of you who would suggest God, yes I am a believer. I turned to him three year ago, after year of Agnosticism, in utter desperation to fill in the missing link . But for whatever reason, He still is not enough. Which is the biggest blow of all, because I truly comprehend the sacrifice that wa made in my behalf with the Atonement, and yet for some reason fail to utilize it. So here I am. One big mess. And I am joining the group, lucky you! See you around",0.29835
"For some reason .. I am never happy anymore .. It all started a little le than a year ago. Suicide attempts, cutting, burning, hair pulling, slapping, basically just wanting to die. People tell me my life is not that bad just because my family ha money. Money is not everything. Also, everyone spread rumor about me, and tell me crap to my face!! My boyfriend is really sweet and I LOVE him, but he ha a serious anger issue! His psychologist diagnosed him with an anger issue. And lately when he get frustrated, he sometimes hit me. Not like REALLY hard, but hard enough to leave a mark. Then later he doe not remember doing it. I am worried about him, and myself. I do not want our relationship to end because of our problems. And none of my friend understand why I cut and stuff. It is not always for attention you know!! So, if someone could please email me at xx. Or reply. That would be great. Please talk to me",0.30182

"I die a little inside with every customer TW Let me start by saying I have been getting help for chronic depression and anxiety since January. I take sertraline mg every day, and it is helped me tremendously. I wa hired a a cashier at a fast food job in November of last year, and it wa a huge step forward. No education, no GED, no transportation, no job experience except for working for a family company since I wa a literal child needle to say, I felt like I overcame a hump that had been looming in front of me for quite some time. I have had extreme social anxiety since my early teens, so diving headfirst into a cashier job seemed a bit counter-intuitive. Now, I do not know if it wa the medication or simply having no choice but to face my fear every day, but the anxiety ha completely faded. Gone. Zilch. Good, right? Well, in it place, a little seedling sprouted, and a time go by it swell inside my heart and head, push against my skull, crush my organs, my spark, my will to move forward. I hate people so fucking much. I am so damn tired of hearing you complain that the price of a sandwich ha increased by fifty fucking cents. I am so damn tired of cleaning up after your little brat after they throw their food on the floor. I am so fucking fed up with you cancelling an entire fucking order, after it wa already prepared, because the soda machine wa out of cherry Fanta. What the fuck is wrong with you? I go home and utterly dread the next day of picking up the slack of my coworkers and dealing with a shitload of entitled, spoiled assholes. Every now and then, there is an angel. Someone who is not a total asshole to me..it could be something so small to you, but it can make my entire day that much easier. Perhaps you already know what you want to order, and do not hold up a line of ten people because you are picky a fuck. Perhaps you tip me cents. Usually, it is treating me like I am a feeling, thinking human instead of the shit on your heel. I bend over backwards for these people and do my best to let them know that they are truly appreciated. I have come so far, and yet I am so close to giving up. It is wearisome forcing a smile every day and powering through a if I have a promising future, when I do not. I pretend that I do not slice my thigh with razors, that I am not covered in self harm scars, that all is well. I pretend I do not fantasize every day about diving headfirst in front of a semi truck. I pretend the love of my life and best friend is not homeless and is not living in a tent with a heroin addict. I pretend, I pretend, I pretend. I am so tired.",0.27505
"I am too much of a coward to even kill myself I am posting this here, not primarily to garner attention or sympathy, but because I have nowhere else to turn and I do not know what to do with myself. I also want to try and combat some of the embarrassment and shame that I feel in regard to being clinically address, so perhaps voicing what I am thinking here, it could potentially be therapeutic for me. Now that is out of the way,this might get quite long, so I will put a tldr at the end of this. Context I am a year old girl. My whole life, my sense of worth wa dictated around whether I could make the people around me happy. I had extremely strict and controlling parent and so I had no real sense of worth other than the fact that at least I did not harbour any malicious feeling towards anyone, or try and hurt anybody deliberately. I had normal teenage angst and moody, brooding periods, but absolutely not depression at all. I wa completely, for want of a better word, normal. In April , I first had feeling of depression, when I realised how badly I had hurt someone who used to be very important in my life. it is an extremely long story and I am slightly more at peace with it now so I do not feel the need to explain because it would take forever . I wa incapicitated for a week, I would cry constantly, not leave my bed, and my mum would scream at me and tell me she wouldid not have time to deal with my shit . However I had a REASON for feeling this down, so whether this wa the start of a biological depression, I am not quite sure. Fast forward to October . This is where my current situation and problem begin. I am currently studying abroad in Japan- something I have been envisioning and looking forward to for years. Honestly, I had been constantly dreaming about this for an extremely long time. It wa what I felt my life wa gearing towards, everything led to this. However, it all went downhill. My host family is incredibly lovely, I had made a couple friend on social medium before even joining the university, and there were so many intercultural exchange opportunity to join. Yet, despite this, I could feel my mood slipping gradually. I have always been a shy person and not good with strangers, but I began to feel a creeping anxiety looming up on me, that told me to not bother others, that by interacting with others I wa causing them inconvenience and discomfort, and the best thing for me to do wa to just be alone. I partly attribute it to the fact I had a really awful teacher in my first semester here. Now, I think some people might think that this might be a cultural shock issue, but I am pretty sure that she wa crossing ANY acceptable line, no matter what culture. Firstly she would be very rude to me in front of all my classmates. Say if I came in without makeup, in jean like, still showered, hair done, not sweatpants or anything, just not completely dolled up she would say in front of everyone Your face is not pretty enough to not wear any makeup. You are scaring everyone. You know girl in Japan care about their appearance. You should do too, for everyone is sake . Also my Japanese is perfectly adequate to understand interaction like that, so I know for a fact that this wa not a language barrier issue. If I got a question wrong in class she would say You know, I do not know why I bother asking planyourspontaneity for answers, she is so useless . Or if we had to make example sentence she would pick example like What doe planyourspontaneity need? Oh planyourspontaneity need to learn how to make some friend . And this became like a running joke in my class. I have never been bullied, so I never learnt to grow a thick skin, so this what felt like daily victimisation began to really grate and tear down my self esteem. I felt isolated so my social anxiety caused me to isolate myself, and people ignoring me, creating a vicious circle. I began to be completely mute in class, ignoring the teacher, be on my phone, having headphone in, and this obviously spurred her on a she would berate me for how I wa a terrible student. Also I feel like it might be relevant to say how I told this teacher that the reason why I wa so withdrawn and using my phone a lot wa because my stepfather wa undergoing cancer treatment and I wa worried this wa true . But she still kept calling me useless and nothe worst student I have ever taught to everyone. If I seemed withdrawn though she would stroke my thigh and lower back and neck I think this contact thing might be a cultural difference but still in front of everyone, which obviously made them think I wa a total freak. If I made eye contact with them, they would quickly shuffle away or look disgusted. Around November-ish time I began to suffer with very extreme bout of depression. I felt awfully ashamed- here I wa living the dream I had longed for for about a decade, and I wa here for some reason feeling absolutely dreadful. Even if I had had a fun day, I still had this lingering sadness, and I would get home and cry. I started seeing a counsellor which wa one of the best decision or rather, my long distance boyfriend decided for me I ever made. In December time it reached the point where I would barely go to class because the idea of seeing people, going to class, and even just getting out of my bed just seemed overwhelmingly difficult to me. I would cry all the time, tug my hair and cut my forearms, and would call the suicide hotline. My teacher emailed me numerous times, all very inappropriately about how her parent were dying to and how I should turn to God not that I do not think that that is a viable avenue for some people, it just seemed like weird advice from my teacher I tried going on anti depressant Escitalopram? but they made me vomit after just one pill so I stopped straight away. I travelled with my long distance boyfriend who came to Japan to see me, and felt nothing. Then I went to Nagano with my host family, and felt some kind of peace, and calmness. This calmness and general mellowness resided in me for some time, until now. Current situation My depression came back with a vengeance yesterday during the day. At lunch time I locked myself into the bathroom to cry and cry. I took a tranquilliser that had been prescribed for me during bout of extreme depression to curb the urge to self harm and it did nothing. I hate myself so much. This exchange, this is what I wanted my life to lead up to, and my fucking brain is ruining it all for me. Aside from this, I had nothing to look forward to in my life. I just want to be happy, I want for people to not hate me. I know most people hate me because of the way they act around me, they will not invite me to any class activity even if I am right there, and I will be the only one not in the class group chat, class karaoke nights, etc etc. Literally the only one. I am scared of going to intercultural lounge to interact with people because they all know each other from last semester, and I cannot even talk to people in real life in the first place. I just feel like an alien. I do not feel like I wa meant to be born in this world at all. All I want is to be suddenly transported into a different world. I do not want to be here anymore. I just want to be asleep forever. I want to be dead. But I am scared of death. I wish I wa religious so I had some motivation for either killing myself and going to heaven, or for fear of hell having motivation and stay alive. What if it hurts? What if the nothingness is unbearable? But I want to be dead. Every time I see a train go by I want to jump so badly. I know my boyfriend and family would be sad but they would get over it. He would get a better, non depressed girlfriend so he doe not have to deal with my shit anymore. My dad ha a new daughter he treat better than he ever did me. My mum would be devastated but I do not know if I can hold on just for her sake. Anyway, I know I am not such a loss to the world. If anything, the vast majority of people in the world would be happy because they would not have to interact with me. I have nothing to offer anyone and my existence is just a waste and if I am not happy why should I even be here. I wish I could gather up the courage to just do it and end it all but I am a coward and I am scared Thank you for reading, sorry for taking up your time.",0.0

I find the word crippling depression very true. But I think it is also a vicious cycle. Anyone have ever done this? It is like you stay in bed or sit around because you feel depressed. And then your foot kind of go numb and it make you feel worse. It is like a vicious cycle. We are supposed to be using our limbs. We are not statues. Anyone ever tried walking around all day keeping sitting minimum? What are the effects? I am thinking of trying it tomorrow. I will just try standing around or walking around all day in my house.,0.40211
"I finally came out to my close friend that I have depression, and now I am being alienated because I am not mentally stable Probably a rant, but what the fuck. This last college semester wa horrible on me, and I came out of it with depression and depression meds. I am M in college right now. I thought it wa pretty obvious, but I wanted to tell my friend about why I have been talking le and have been hermitting myself out a little. So the next time we are all together, I tell them that I have depression and that is why I am taking med and that is why I have gotten so quiet, ect. And.. Barely any response. Basically just some oh, ok.. Like really? But it get is better. So the night after I tell them, I get a message from one of my friend , whom I wa going to room with next year. The message said, and I can quote, that they do not feel safe around a mentally dark person in their house. Ok, what? Even better, the convo go on and say that my group of friend were talking.. And they do not want to, in quote again, Associate with a mentally dark person a a friend. Like what the fuck? It is been a week and they have lived up to it. Suddenly I am not getting invited anywhere or anything. If I am with my friend I still try to hang out , I will get heavily ignored. Like what the fuck, my depression ha now gotten so much worse. I want to ditch every single one of them, but I honestly do not have any other close friend outside of this group. I am trying my best to find new friends, and if that happens, I will happily leave these people who consider depression sufferer dark and unstable and unsafe .

This is not just like being in a bad friend group, ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE I know ha needed a break from me or told me to go away. Counselors who are getting paid to deal with me make me feel like I am being too annoying. Maybe I am talking over them too much or I am too jittery.

"I just feel trapped I am finishing up my Masters degree and just feel hopeless right now. I hate school. I am starting to hate my field of study too. I play the trumpet. But to be honest, I am not very good at it. High notes, any other trumpet player will be able to understand. In the past two years, my playing ha underwent some other terrible thing where I hesitate at the start of anything I play. It is percent mental. I have made some stride in it, but it still come back. For the past two years, it ha made me feel like I cannot even play a simple fucking melody to someone if asked. Trumpet is basically my adventure, but it seems like I just cause myself pain. I want to keep working on it, but boy it hurt my soul to suck and to keep not doing well. On top of that, I struggle with my weight. I love fast food. I know it is bad, but I use it to cope. I also would love to stop watching porn. I am addicted to that. I have been addicted to that since I wa probably in the th grade.

No big deal I am pretty used and expect people to drift out of my life. I know people who I used to be friend with but now we are just accquantences, we do not talk at all but follow each other on social media. But here is the thing, when you post thing on social medium about how you are ready to kill your self or how depressed you are and you do not even get a text asking if you are okay- doe that mean no one cares? I see them caring about other people but they never seen to make sure if I am okay. I mean I do not expect them to, but I know when I see people that I care about talking like that I need to make sure that they are okay. I mean, how can you say you are friend with someone but not even say anything when they are threatening to kill the selves. It is weird, you will be Sauk g how much you want to die and how depressed you are and no one will say anything BUT they will make sure to send you a picture on Snapchat to keep the streak lol.

"I have never talked about this to anyone I have struggled with depression since I wa in nd grade. For the last year it is gotten worst, I am at the moment. When I wa I wa raped occasionally. Being raped when it first happen did not bother me a much because I didnt understand what wa happening until year later. What did bother me at the time wa that I felt alone. I have always felt alone, never felt like anyone cared for me or about me. I fought with my mom and step dad a lot which made me feel even more lonely. I never talked about feeling lonely to anyone because I wa always embarrassed about it and still do. Because me and my parent had a rocky relationship I would be abused by both at times. One time I wa arguing with my mom and she ended up getting a by and started hitting me with it. I never rasied my hand at my parents, just talked a lot of shit and wa an asshole to them. My parent kicked me out of their house when I wa . I ended up living with my grandpa. This made me feel unwanted and even more lonely now that my parent gave up on me. I lived with my grandpa for about month before he sent me back to my parent because he could not afford to keep me. I wa not an asshole to my grandpa nor wa I mean to him, I just wa a teen who stayed up late and took long showers. My grandpa giving up on me wa heartbreaking for me. I felt like no one wanted me and if I ended everything then everything would be better. I did not even last a week at my parent house, they shipped me off to live with some family who lived in the rural country area instead of the city. I lived there for maybe month and finished my freshman year of high school there. I did not feel welcomed anywhere I went and for the most part I felt more beyond alone. Majority of the time at my uncle is I wa in my room, alone and desperate for a friend. After lonely month of really being alone I wa given back to my parent again. After coming home broken I learned to keep to myself. No one wanted me and no one cared. When I got back home I wa sent to an all boy high school. Once again I had to go to a new school and try to fit in somehow. I wa lonely for a while until I met this girl. I am afraid to write her name incase she ever read this and it hurt reading writing it but I need to get this off my chest. I met this beautiful girl named Cindy at a school function. She went to the all girl school down a couple streets. Both all gender school would make event for each other to get student that social interaction. Anyways I meet this beautiful girl named Cindy, she wa nice to me and I wa nice to her. We dated for over a year and while it lasted it wa nice. The way she broke up with me literally broke me. I wa having a really sad day and told her about how I struggle with really bad depression and that I have suicidal thoughts. Her response wa oh and she slowly stopped talking to me. Eventually she stopped talking to me and when she did talk to me she made excuse about not having time to talk to me. She wa my only friend, the only person I wa close to. She could not be there for me when I needed her most, when I needed a friend most. So I stayed alone thinking maybe school wa too much for her at the moment. Then one day I get on Facebook only to see her on it, I clicked on her page and saw that she had been on hanging out with friend and having the time of her life. She slowly broke me, I could not handle it and called her to confront her about it. She made excuse and talked about how she didnt have time for me at the moment, so she hung up and left it alone. I wa reaching my breaking point, I wa going to commit suicide. I sent her a text message talking about how I needed her to talk to me and be a friend because I wa getting worst. She never responded to me however she did get in contact with my school to let them know what I wa dealing with. I wa so embarrassed that she did this to me, I felt betrayed and hurt that she made me the school problem instead of hers. It hurt ne so bad. I wa embarrassed that the school knew, I wa embarrassed that my parent knew now. I wanted to kill myself more than ever now. I wa so hurt by this and wa angry at Cindy. I went home and tried stabbing myself. My mom went in my room to talk to me, just so happened at that moment I had a kitchen knife in my hand to stab myself. My mon fought me over it and sent me to a psychiatric hospital. I stayed there until December rd. At the hospital I tried killing myself twice. First time wa when the guard resident give you cracks, I ate the cracker but stuffed the wrapper down my throat. One if the resident heard me making choking nosies and came in to save me. Second time wa when I started swallowing my food instead of chewing on it to choke me out again. They put me on these medication that did not help but I acted like they did so I can go home. I wa alone again, Cindy stopped talking to me. It broke my heart and broke me. It is been year since Cindy and I am not over it. It still kill me about what happened. I am still depressed and suicidal. I honestly wish I did kill myself when I had the courage to do so. There ha not been much for me other than pain. I have not moved on and I have not gotten over everything. This wa my deepest darkest moment in my life so far. I wish I could say thing got better for me since all of that but true is they have not. I am still the same lonely person I have always felt I have been for the longest time. I have tried dating in college and I have never had feeling for anyone. Do not have many friend and do not have any real reason to be here still. I am just waiting on that one thing to break me down to give me courage. If you read this thank you. Im sorry I made you read a lot and I am sorry that I am this way. I will get better one day but not soon.",0.0

"I am not worth it I just do not feel like I am worth anyone is time or effort, and I just feel like a burden to everyone.

But I am sure I have ruined her whole life. She had me when she wa , which meant she had to quit her job because she could not afford childcare and she had an abusive step-dad, who would refuse to let her mum look after me, and she also fell out with her very religious grandparent a she wa not married they have since made up . She then could not get a job until I started school which is actually a decent job . At this new job, she met my step-dad after a few year and they have since had a child together who also doe not seem to like me one bit . My step dad seems to hate me more than my mum does, but I cannot complain because neither of them are abusive, and this is one of my problem I feel like I should not moan about anything in my life I live in a decent sized bedroom house, I have an education and I also have a job. Whilst my mum lived with her abusive step-dad, wa forced to quit college so she could get a job to start paying rent and wa also forced to baby sit whilst her parent went out drinking every other night. Yet here I am, never feeling happy, without many friend I talk to the people at work when I am there and I have other friend that I speak to around twice a month, normally because there other friend are busy and they want to complain about their boyfriends, or because the other friend doe not want to go shopping on her own another reason why I do not have a reason to be negative she wa in care and now classified a homeless a she is now and not catered for in the care system, so now she ha to live in temporary accommodation with lot of drug user in the same building. I feel like I just ruin everything, if I am downstairs with my family, there always seems to be an argument, even if I am not involved in the argument. But if everyone else is in the living room, whilst I am upstairs in my own, I can only ever here them laughing and enjoying themselves. It is like, even when I have not done anything, I seem to just produce a negative atmosphere. I really do not want to be here anymore, if I disappeared, it would not really effect any one, my mum might be upset at first but she would quickly realise how much better her life is without me. The problem is that I am even too lazy and stupid to kill myself, so I am just secretly hoping that a medical issue that ha been ongoing for a while and I have not been to the doctor is in year because I would just be wasting their time, when they could be helping someone better than me is serious, and nature will take it cause..",0.31127

"Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad? Well I often do, quite sometimes frankly. I just miss those good old days, when life wa just so beautiful and easy. Nothing to worry about, nothing to cry for other than silly childish little things. My childhood wa so beautiful. It wa in France. It is been now a whole decade since I left France - the country I have always admired and will always do. I remember going to school, having so many friends, I felt like I am the happiest child on Earth. Then suddenly one day, everything changed. The passing of time took away from me my childhood, my friends, my beloved France. Life suddenly just changed like that. No more joy, no more innocence, no more real friends, no more homeland. No more beautiful sunny days, only darkness, depression, nostalgia and tears. I am trying to survive day by day through this hell on Earth. Each time those memory of my childhood flashbacks, I cannot help stopping the tear that drop from my eyes. Whenever someone mention France, I get overwhelmed. I am living the hardest time of my life. A -year war in lifetime , a I call it, still going on, and doe not seem to have an end soon. I know those good old time are just memories, obviously. Tomorrow when I wake up, thing will be just the same. But my hope will never die. My redemption will come, soon or late. This moment of my life will also be just memories, just like those good old day of my childhood in France. I did not go in detail cause I do not think many people will be interested in my story. But if you are, I would not mind sharing you the whole story, a long a you can share me yours. And how about you? Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad?",0.2788

"I want to share a personal project I am proud of A month ago I wa feeling completely unmotivated to do anything. I wa feeling that none of my connection with friend are a deep a they used to be, that I am not a close to my family a I used to be, that nothing I do at work really matters, and that my health is slowly deteriorating. I just wanted to quit at everything. Then I wa hanging out with a friend I had not seen in a while, and he admitted to me that he had been struggling with depression, so we both opened up about it. He ended up recommending the book Feeling Good to me, since it had helped him improve a lot. I read it and wa initially a bit disappointed.. some part were underwhelming, some felt annoying condescending, and the solution to every problem seemed to be the three-column technique. But after trying a few of the exercise in the book, I admit it turned out to be somewhat helpful. One of the exercise quiz in the book is the Depression Checklist, which a I am sure many of you are aware of ass your level of depression on a scale from to . At the time, I wa scoring in the Moderate range. After a couple week of applying some of the exercises, I wa down to the Mild range. So I decided to create a project that might help me learn a bit more about myself, with regard to the effect of my daily habit on my level of depression. What I wanted to build wa a simple web app that would let me score my productivity on a daily basis based on exercising, reading, socializing, meditating, etc and then plot that against my daily depression score. I wanted to see if there wa a correlation between higher productivity and lower depression, or if certain activity had a greater impact on my mood. Ironically what I discovered wa that working on the project itself wa a huge mood-booster for me, since it gave me a sense of purpose and wa a great outlet for creativity. As I have gotten further along in the work, I have noticed my depression level ha slowly started rising again. But for a while, I wa actually in the Normal range of depressive emotions! I could not believe it. Regardless, the project ha also given me more insight into a few thing that drastically help my mood. Even though my mood is not at the level it wa a couple week ago, it is nice to know that investing in personal project give me a lot of satisfaction Also if anyone is interested in trying out the app, feel free to check it out here . It is stupid simple and still a work in progress, but I am still kinda proud of it.. and if it were able to help even just one other person, that would make me pretty happy lt",0.0

"Why my relationship is killing me Okay, disclaimer, former relationship.. but it still ha a huge effect on my life. This girl wa my best friend and my first serious relationship. I met her when I first got depressed, and we went to the same church together. I told her then that I did not feel ready for a relationship, but she essentially stalked me all those year ago. Christmas , after dealing with a crap load more grief and depression, I wa essentially forced into a relationship with her. I had just got over my main stint of depression the previous September, and my life wa getting better. We still hung out a friends, but she kept pushing for more. However, she is so messed up. I have to say that now. I do still love her, and that will probably never change, but she need professional help, and my mistake wa thinking I could help her. She wa my best friend after all. So, after a string of breakups, moving too slow and moving too fast, a well a her cheating on my several times, she finally called it quits one week after my birthday November just gone . I had no say, because she would throw a tantrum, but I had to take the initiative. Why? Because she no longer wanted to have my baby. In August, she fell pregnant. This could have been the week prior the Anniversary of our first kiss, but the nurse dated it on that specific date. That wa one of the night she cheated on me, with her friend is boyfriend, but it wa just a kiss . She tried to miscarry by drinking heavily for the next few week before coming to me about it she had broken up with me the day after she cheated. I asked her there and then if she wanted to keep it. She said yes. We went to speak to my mum. My mum asked her. She said yes. She wanted to announce the pregnancy, to start all the planning, and looking forward to the future. I got a well paying job to provide for our future, a job I travelled hundred of mile for each week, and it wa only for a few months. But whilst I wa away, she decided she missed all the drinking, drugs, and sex she wa missing out on. She wanted to live with her friend who she actually hate living with at time , and countless other reasons. However, she kept stringing me along until the scan, where she sent me a photo of our child before telling me she wanted to abort it. Oh, and I had planned a weekend away for u to relax and see some friends. She had me believe this wa the start of my happy ever after, before ripping it away from me. She did not speak to me for two weeks. When I finally did manage to get in touch, it wa to collect my stuff. I took a mutual friend with me, the act a a buffer, and they could not believe the stuff that she said to me. Then I get a load of hate off her because people are contacting her about her choices. Remember, she ha been posting on FB all about the baby, making sure everyone knows. She ha not spoken to me since. She ha blocked me anyway she can, even on WhatsApp only recently.. not that it matters, because she want nothing to do with me. This wa my best friend, and my stalker, who for year wanted to be with me, have a family with me, worried I would not want her because of PCOS, and got jealous over people talking to me on Twitter, and kittens! She could not even handle me showing up with chocolate and flowers! All that I have done for her, supported her, sacrificed for her.. and this is how she treat me. Now, I am pro-life, and pro-choice. I gave her that choice, and she wanted to go ahead. I did not force her or convince her. She led me. She set me up, just to rip out my heart. Seriously, if you only knew the half of it. The card she wrote for me for my birthday alone would have anyone convinced. But now, she is living her life. She is out drinking, smoking, doing drug and sleeping with anything she can get her claw into. She ha restarted her YouTube career , and quite frankly, they are boring videos. Maybe she will do better. I hope not. But I think that is normal. So why this post? Because it is killing me. I do not know how, but I am still kicking. Depression is creeping at my door, and I do have horrible days, bad day where I am so demotivated. Yet, I cannot stop thinking about her. She ha me broken, in ruins.. even my faith ha been hit hard. I do not understand what changed. I do not understand she did what she did. Why did she play me for so long just to hurt me? Everyone tell me to forget about her, and no one would allow me to go back to her even if it wa a possibility . All I want to do is to forget about her, because a the title says.. this relationship is killing me.",0.28570999999999996

"Well I am getting ready to go back to school so I am trying to get sober for a while and see i can clear my head. So far I have been sober for about day and i must say I am not feeling any better. Some of the problem is probably zyrtec which I am taking for my allergy but really i just feel really irritable and confused. i cannot really think too well and it is making me want to drink. Drinking slows down my mind somewhat so i can focus on thing in my head. Normally it not till the next day after a good night of drinking that i feel good for most of the next day. i am more talkative and can come up with thing much easier. There are people who use Prozac and other anti-depressant drug not because they want it but because it make them feel even better than they normally do. This is somewhat my issue with alcohol however i do not fell good normally i feel like s t normally. i guess i should let u in on what is really bothering me. First ill just list the problem i have i find most worrying. Night blindness fuzzy vision bad sinus pressure moderate fatigue all the time short term memory problem random ache and pain major depression, anxiety, and ocd bad allergy acid reflux. To be honest most scary one is night blindness. Trying to explain is pretty difficult but ill try. It is like being able to see all the con and rod and your eye flash on and off constantly kind of like a bad channel on a TV screen. I have had it for year now with no one who can really give me straight answer about it. i went to my doctor recently and got up the nerve to tell him but thought he gave me some good info he probably thought i wa mad. Anyway one of the first thing your body will do when it is over exerted is give u fuzzy vision. Now normally night blindness is caused be a vitamin A deficiency. Maybe there is something wrong with my stomach that is making me feel the way i am and i did have kidney stone when i wa which is very rare. i know this is a lot of information but this is what i deal with on a daily basis. My daily routine is almost exactly the same except on weekend when i do go out and drink with my friends. my will is low and energy just a low so i find myself kind of in and out of this trance that is supposed to be life. Each day i go to work, come home, eat, and up to my room for pretty much the rest of the night. do not get me wrong i do other thing during the week sometimes but i feel most comfortable by myself in my room a opposed to human contact which sucks. So if i have to drink to keep from going over the deep end then i will do so until i get some real answers. If anyone ha any answer I am all ears.",0.26316999999999996

My depression and anxiety is slowly killing me. I am a year old male, trying to restart my adult life in college after many failed attempt at succeeding anywhere else. I work and I go to school, I see hundred of smiling and happy faces, and I feel like I am not even really there with them. Like a one way mirror where I see them but I am never seen. I have no friends. I used to be a part of rather large group of friends, but a of now I could not tell you the last time I talked to any of those people. They have either moved on and some of them are no longer on this earth.

The only person I have is my mother, and she tends to make matter worse when I try to open. I am also desperately single. I have not been in a relationship, let alone just dated someone, in years. And it is soul crushing. I see all these happy couple around campus, beautiful men and women, having the time of their life with each other. And I am so fucking jealous man. I want that happiness so desperately bad. I want to love someone, I want to FEEL loved! I want someone to help me through day like today, and to be there for them when they have those days. I want the cheesy shit like cuddling and laughing over stupid stuff. I want the inevitable time where we are pissed at each other about something, but we work through it and end up going crawling up next to each other in bed at the end of the night, and wake up to see each other to start the day. I am tired of waking up to this massive empty bed, cold and alone. But most of all, I am tired of pretending. Of having to pretend. To wear this mask every single fucking day of my life just to pretend to be normal. Just so my coworkers will not think I am weird. Just so my mom will not go off about how I just need to get my shit together. Just so I can hold up the chance that one day I will be able to overcome my massive wall of social anxiety and try to talk to someone, make a friend, maybe meet a girl.

"Long Winded Post From a Failed Year Old I do not even necessarily want to write this but I need to clear my head. I have been a depressed pissant for a long a I could remember.

Luckily, it wa more of a this is not working so we will forget it happened type deal and my enlistment ended without anything terrible. But I never recovered. At least back then I had some sort of tenacity. Now? I am a fucking shell, mate, of what I was. A completely hollow individual. I am year old. I have no education. I have no passions. I used to enjoy writing but I cannot bring myself to write anymore. The moment I try I go back into wounded animal mode. No, this is not good enough. Nope, neither is this. Why bother? Why try? I cannot help but think these things. I am still married and that is the only reason I have not killed myself. I did try early on because of relentless hounding from my father in law. It is obvious I am not what he wanted for his daughter. I cannot figure out why I am alive at all. I can barely live my life. I am depressed constantly. No matter how happy I know I should be or how wide I smile I am in the grey of storm cloud that seemed, at least until this subreddit, to be only over my head. I have had so many job that I just explosively quit. I have got Intermittent Explosive Disorder a well a depression and anxiety. So I coil up and wind tightly before my brain dump chemical that make me explode with no regard for the damage done. I am currently unemployed. I left my last job like that. I loved my job. I loved the guy I worked for. I earned several raise within a few month and wa promoted quickly because I threw my back into that work. It ha been too long though. I cannot seem to find another job. I cannot even bring myself to apply anymore. I do not have a car. I rent a couple room off the main house of my inlaws. I failed so hard in giving my wife a life worth living. She spends her time working and though understands and doe not mind my unemployment it is killing me. On Dec.th I lost all interest in anything. I used to escape in video game but now I cannot. I load up Ark and just stare. I have anxiety about everything. Recently installed Heroes of the Storm and I played a mean Lili and Abathaur but now I have got butterfly even playing against bots. The smallest, most simple of task seems beyond me. I am stupider than I used to be. How I interpret the simplest of sentence or instruction is out of whack. I have trouble reading though I have got ton of read Omnibuses from Warhammer k on my bookshelf. I have trouble speaking. I talk slowly and can barely push out the word off my tongue. I am only recently able to make phonecalls without losing my mind anxiety wise. I am so full of regret. I hate what I became. I hate that I married someone and am dragging them through the mud. To never have a real apartment or car. I cannot hold a job. I barely take care of the house. I do dish now but it is a real struggle. I have been thinking a lot more about suicide and I am already sure I am too cowardly to really do it but I think about it a lot. How it would hurt my wife but I think it would be good for her to find someone else. I just do not see the point in continuing. I am an adult now but I never learned how to properly be an adult. I do not know what to do. There is a burning hole in my chest and I feel guilty that I am the way that I am. Even on the subreddit. I know people feel that people who have a significant other cannot be a depressed but I am swimming at the bottom of the barrel. I want this all to end. I do not know how to survive. I do not know how people manage it. I do not have that self-preservation sense that keep people going despite it all. I am weak. I am weak in way that I can barely accept. I struggle a lot with the fact veteran a day kill themselves but I am still around. I carry endless guilt that better people die and I am still alive. Goddamn it. People are dying from disease and cancer while I exist. While I cannot so much a go outside without feeling like all eye are boring hole into my psyche. I hate that all I do is sit here and lay in bed. I hate myself. I feel if I do not get this out, even if it is never seen by anyone, I will implode. I am on medication and it helped my depression but then the reality of my life struck me and I think I am worse off than I was. At least then I wa able to lose myself in video games. Now I am here with the stark reality. I am not meant for this world. I am too sensitive, too weak, too weak-willed, and too much of a bitch to handle life. I will go back to lurking now. Thanks for listening.",0.37595
The thing that suck is that i have no one left to talk to No one is willing to talk to me and listen to my bullshit. And everyone that I have told end up leaving me or call the cop or some shit.

"I need to get my life on track Im year old black man who just graduated from one of the best university in the US. I have been depressed a fuck for a large portion of the last - years. I have no money, no girlfriend or prospect , and no social life to speak of. I had a solid social life in college but had no luck with girls. Made a lot of friend but none that I would consider great ones. I am afraid of public expression, if I come out of this shell I will just be that little underdeveloped, short loser who think he is the shit when he is accomplished nothing in life. I am afraid of what other people think of me, do they think I am smart? Do they think I am nerdy? Do they think I cannot dance? Do they think I am too short? Do they think I am attractive? Do they think I am gay? Do they think my voice is deep enough? Do they think I am laid back? Do they think I am fake? Do they think I am a pussy? Do they think I get girls? Do they think my dick is small? Do they think I am dressed well? Do they think I am shy? Do they think I am lame for a black guy? Do they think I act too white? Do they notice the awkwardness when I talk? Do they think I speak well? Do they think I ask too many questions? This cause me to lie to the people around me, including my family about little thing that it is unnecessary to lie about. To put on this front of fake confidence when inside I feel like I am not worth shit. I blow off my friend and then justify it to myself that I am somehow too good for them. I do not pick up phone call from family member and try to keep to myself. I just do nothing all day and wait for shit to come to me. I am not the guy that get girls, when it come to trying to actually start a relationship with a girl my awkwardness and lameness just begin to show itself and she immediately sens it and can tell I am not shit. I have had sex with girl in my life and could not actually bust a nut for whatever reason. I am an asshole to the people around me that do really nice thing for me but somehow my brain keep justifying my behavior and I keep doing it. I cannot bring myself to do anything that is remotely productive or will help me better my life. I am self aware to the point where I know I am being a complete piece of shit but I cannot find the motivation to turn it around. It is like my brain telling me I will be content just living in my parent house until I am fucking year old. Somehow when I look in the mirror I see myself a an attractive man, I just look super young for , people say I look a young a so I am also self conscious about that which also make me put on this facade when I am around people. Recently for long stretch of month I just go completely ghost and do not leave the house or do anything of use. On the bright side I have had many positive experience in life where I have felt my potential a a person start to become realized. I have a degree in communication study from a top university in the US. I have a family that love and support me but probably want me to move out just a much a I want to move out . This is all pretty incoherent and stream of consciousness but my brain is just really jumbled right now and I had to vent. I need to turn my fuckin life around.",0.22735
"Hi everyone. I am here because I am very depressed due to uncontrollable situation of extreme stress this year and a lifetime of stupid choice that have led me to where I am today lonely and sad. I talked to my primary dr. and now have been taking Zoloft for almost months. It seems to help some, I do not feel like I will panic to the point of losing control completely. And I am seeking help, I do not have a therapist yet, but I checked with my insurance and wrote some name down, now I have to pick up the phone and speak into the receiver and set an appointment. My plan is to do this on Monday. I like to be supportive of others, so although I do sound gloomy, I hope to meet others who are making progress and maybe be of help to you, too. I will post more later I feel the need to sleep. I have trouble with sleep and nightmare and eating, lately I have to force myself to eat, I have a weird aversion to food, I start to feel sick queasy when I try to eat. But life in general make me sick and queasy. I am alone for the Holidays which suit me just fine. I wish I could go to the Island of misfit people and stay there and never leave. For now that is the comfort and safety of my home, unless I go to work or need groceries. Later..",0.0
"Long text, I just want an audience. Why have not I killed myself yet? It is not the title, but a question that lingers on the back of my head every second. It is a common trend that people live for other people but what do you do when you have no one to live for? I never had anyone to live for. It is not a huge problem really, it another lingering question or jealousy I have whenever I meet a person. Every single one of them have someone who care for them, even a stranger would care for them. It make me feel jealous that no one would care for me or even bother to be nice to me unless I open my mouth and say I have cancer or they knew about any of my situation. People do not care, they pity me. They realize, then, that I am a hopeless situation and they cannot help me at all because they really cannot. No one can. Therapies do not help. My therapist know all of my situation are out of my control and he want me to move forward with my life. It is not really a bad idea, it is the smart thing to do especially being someone in my situation. I just do not know why I cannot. Every single being on the planet want me to graduate already but my body doe not agree with me. It is always either I am too sad stressed depressed ashamed anxious lazy to go to school. Nothing helps. Not even the mg of Lexapro helps. My school counsellor is doing the nice I get it, I understand approach with me and it make me feel better but it really doe make me feel guilty. I just do not understand why are people act so shitty with me? Is it my face? Is it because no one care and all I have is literally myself? Is it because I am dying soon? What is it really? I just want to fucking die but I cant just let myself slash my throat or swallow a lot of pill because I am a coward. I want the easy way out. Why is not cancer an instant death? Why are not suicide booth similar to futurama a thing? I give up. I just want to die. P.S. Fuck people who say they are afraid of rejection because hunty what world do u fucking live in that not one single person ha said no to you? P.P.S. Fuck you E, I am sorry I disappointed you that I did not die yet even my diagnosis average life span is months. Do not worry, it is coming. And I surely fucking hope karma is real. It is fucking people like you who deserve such thing and what do you fucking get? A nice family, a handsome face, people who like to be around you. You are one of the people who deserve my revenge and yet I am being like a pussy who is letting a fake thing called karma take care of everything. In this fucking lifetime, not a single one got any karma. or maybe my parent did by god giving me cancer but idk they just labelled me a a liability and now ha dropped me like a hot potato so that is really more on me than on them PLEAASE I just want to die. Please just kill me.",0.0
"Hello everyone. My name is Amy. I discovered this page just by searching on the internet for depression forums. One good thing about me, I believe, is that I am very mature for my age. I am seventeen, and really hope everyone here is open-minded to age being just a number. So please, do not reply telling me I will have it better later on, or my problem are because of my age. I know there is a possibility that thing will get better, and believe me, I really do not think this ha to do with teenage hormones. I have read about many middle aged woman and men with the same problems. I understand that I am a very negative person, most likely due to depression. I am very irritable, only maybe once a week I am happy for most of the day. I also know that I have never really been happy. I have never been optimistic, and have always been sensitive, emotional, and not very confident. At the moment I do not have any friends. I have not really had any friend for a few year now. Once every few month or so I will go out, and then just want to leave within a couple of hours. It is very stressful to me. And when I do want to leave, I just tell myself I have a problem, because everyone else I know seems to get along with people just fine. I am also like this with jobs. I go in and out of jobs. One time I even faked a family emergency just to leave work..and I wa cry about it. If one thing go wrong for me, if I smile at someone and they do not smile back, if I feel insecure in any way, my first reaction is to flee. I also, for the most part of my life have always been in a relationship. My boyfriend a of right now and I have been together for over a year. Both of u cheated on each other in the beginning of our relationship, which might be the cause of our jealousy problem now mostly mine . But, before this relationship, I also had the same problem. I never felt good enough, I believe I will never feel pretty enough. I have big issue with porn, and basically every little thing you can think of. Recently I have been reading about depression and anxiety. I feel the more I understand how and that it is a part of me, the worse I feel about myself. And the more insecure I feel. I feel like I am not fun to be around since I am irritable and sad most of the time. I feel like my boyfriend will find someone who ha more of the good qualities. I feel that I will never satisfy or make my parent proud, since I keep leaving jobs. They tell me I am just lazy. I have quit every single thing in my life that I have tried since I wa young. But I really think it is because of my mental state. Going out in public is terrifying, because I do not want to feel bad, ugly, unfun, or not funny. I fear social situations, because I am horrible at making conversation. I have been considering therapy and depression anxiety pills, but my mom tell me people who take them basically just do not feel anything at all. And I am also afraid to see a doctor and share my feelings. I feel like I have no one to talk to. My dad and I have never had a good relationship, we maybe say two word to each other a day. We have had kind of a bad past, and maybe that is the reason for our lack of communication. My boyfriend doe not really know how to talk about important or emotional things, unless they have to do with him. I feel like every time I cry I push him farther away from me, and feel I have to hide everything because me being depressed is a turn off to him. I do not know. I guess we all have to vent somewhere, and to know that there is a place where people feel the same is a great thing to me. I wish there wa an easy way to feel good about myself, and just be happy for once. But I suppose these thing take time and a lot of effort. I am sure I left some thing out, but this is all I want to throw at you all for now. Thank you for listening.",0.33333
"Does anybody feel like their life is meaningless if they do not have a relationship or crush In my opinion it feel like love is the only medicine strong enough to cure my depression.

"It is not some fucking sadness anymore. This is madness. I remember when I just had a few day when I felt sad and out of it. And I would worry but then everything became better a few day later. Still, I went to a psychologist, because my down were too consistent to be considered normal. It all went downhill from there. I feel like I have lost a part of myself. My personality, my identity, whatever. I feel like when I talk to others I am not there , like I have lost control of what I say and think. Like I have lost my mind. Like others are normal and I am in my own world, going through life on automatic mode, not knowing what I should think, say, or do. Even though from outside people might say I am completely normal, even sometimes better than before, I feel like mentally, inside, the world is going down. My life is crumbling. Like piece by piece I get further away from a solution. Things that seem to work for others do not work for me. I hate it. It is not just a bad mood anymore. It is feeling like I have lost my way, and there is no sign to get back. Like a loop I cannot get out of. That is why suicide come up a an option. When you are stuck in a loop, the only solution is to shut off. If sleeping is the only thing I enjoy, then why will not I sleep forever? Fuck that shit",0.395

"Here is a new update for interested readers. Bad news first I got a voicemail last week, it said my mother wa in the hospital. It took me awhile to get more info, I called and left a message where she lived because it wa too late to get anyone on the phone there. I finally found out where she wa and called the hospital. They said she wa having problem walking, that maybe she hurt her back. That she wa getting breathing treatment because she had trouble breathing. Part of it wa she could not smoke, part of it wa probably because she doe smoke. They did not seem to find out what caused the problem with her legs. Then she had some other stuff wrong. Part of the good news wa one thing they thought wa wrong wa caused by a shot they gave her, and it wa solved the next day. Now, I called her Friday and she said her heart test showed a tear in a valve. She is getting a more detailed test next week, the doctor said it is too early to tell how serious it is or if it need anything done to it. He told her, it could be just something minor that need to be monitored and could cause no problem at all or it could require heart surgery. So I wa very worried about that. My first thought when I heard she wa in the hospital wa that she would end up having cancer from smoking, or liver disease from drinking. But I did not think of any heart problems. I am hoping that it will not be anything serious, or that if she need surgery that it will be successful and she will recover without any complications. I do not know much about heart surgery, I know I have heart that many bypass patient have good surgery but get sick and die from complication after the surgery. I hope and pray that she will be ok, I live far from her and cannot do anything but call her and pray. Now some good news, my new job is going to switch me to fulltime hour next week. I still have to find out if it will be temporary or long-term, but I am happy either way. I went from poor and going to be homeless, to having a place to live and a low-stress job in a short time. Each day I wake up and am alive and have a place to live mean a lot to me now. It kind of give me a better perspective on life in a way. I know so many people have it worse, so much suffering in the world and I am lucky. I have to get some new clothes because changing to fulltime I have to go by a different dress code, so I will be looking for cheap nice clothes tomorrow. I am thankful I have some money to look for clothes. I am still adjusting to things, sometimes I feel like where am I, what is going on? but it is better than before when I wa at my apartment thinking when will I get kicked out, where will I live? I am trying to take it one step at a time, not worry about where I am supposed to be going in life. I am thinking, what do I need, get thing stable, be able to support yourself, get a phone, get car insurance, get more hour at work etc.. I try to stay positive and be grateful, but still I am a little lost. If anyone want more detail about things, or advice on how I have coped with anything just leave a reply and I will answer you. I have a lot of thing I have learned and advice, but I do not go around telling people what to do or pushing my point of view. I try to just express myself without pushing.",0.24807

It wa because of my second semester of freshman year that I thought my chance of a four year were impossible. I also never bothered to do the ACT SAT because I thought that with my low gpa it would not have mattered anyway. The following year in h I have managed to improve a bit but not all that much. After high school ended I spent a year and a half not really knowing what I wa doing taking a class at my community college here and there but not really committing, while also changing my major at least twice. If I play my card right I will be able to graduate by he end of May in and hopefully transfer to a university. But recently I cannot help but think of how my life would have been if I had just went straight to a university after high school. I do not have any friend right now and I feel that if I had gone to university out of high school I would have had friend at this point. Right after high school I did not really have any second thought and what I wa doing. I wa fine with going to community college and transferring later on but right now I cannot help but feel that I have made a huge mistake. If only I had done better in freshman year I probably would have gotten accepted into university and had a completely different life. I am only and I already feel like a huge goddamn retard for how I acted in my high school life. If i had taken thing more seriously my life right now would have been a lot better. I feel like I have massively screwed myself. Most of the time now I think about what I could have done differently in high school and what my life would be like now. I honestly hate everything about myself and wish that I could just go back and make thing right in high school.",0.17733000000000002
"I want to get help, but I also do not I do not want to stay like this forever. If I do I will end up killing myself. I do not know what to do to get help, given that, while I live on my own, I am not on my own health insurance and I do not want my parent involved. What if I did get help? The doctor would probably run me through a variety of medication that could have bad side effects. I read one time about a guy who basically lost his sexuality because of an antidepressant he got put on. What if something life-altering like that were to happen to me? I am afraid to risk it.",0.30615
"Ready to just say fuck it I cannot take it anymore. I am an atheist democrat living in a family of hardcore christian conservatives. Ive made it clear that Im a democrat, to which they just call me a snowflake all the time, which just make me resent them even more. I dont dare tell them Im am atheist, but Im thinking about it. I dont have anything to live for anymore. I dont have any idea what to do with my life. I dont have any special talent or skills. The only hobby I really have is video games, but Im horrible at those. I have raged so hard at Battlefield that I broke down in tear and drooled everywhere, and anytime I play an RPG I restart so many time that it make me not want to play anymore. All my friend have at least an idea of what they want to do, but I dont even have the beginning of a clue a to what I want to do with the rest of my life. And to be honest, Im scared of becoming an adult. Managing a budget, doing taxes, paying bills, and shit like that. Im not fucking prepared for it. If I cant deal with the stress of a fucking video game, then I sure a hell cant deal with a job. My parent are also hounding me to get a girlfriend. I dont even have a friend who is a girl. All my close friend are male. Hell, the closest Ive came to having a full conversation with a girl is helping her with spanish homework. I aint gay, I just cant talk to girls. The social anxiety make me want to vomit if I even think about approaching a girl. So Im ready to fuck it all and just tell my parent Im an atheist. Let them send me to whatever fucking counseling they want. Let them disown me and have to go live with a friend. I have no future other than a goddamn walmart greeter at this point",0.33219000000000004
"exhausted this is my first time posting on this subreddit but I need something to regurgitate everything that I am feeling a it may be the only thing that stop me from trying to hurt myself. I have only slept for about hour and I have to be up for work in minute which is making me feel worse. As my depression ha gotten worse, I find myself sinking further into a place where I have no desire to help or look after myself. I still live at home with my parent and since my mom is aware of my attempt to hurt myself, she ha taken on a lot of the responsibility that I once had for myself. Like cooking for me, cleaning for me, taking me to work sometimes, sleeping in my bed with me. I feel so fucking bad about that, I feel bad for her and I feel bad that she is really the only person. I have my boyfriend who ha been a supportive a he can be, especially because he is dealing with his own obstacle and I feel like I am incapable of being there for him. I keep having thought of breaking up with him and becoming so sensitive towards everything he say and it make me beyond word angry at myself that I have failed him and our relationship. I cannot make me happy, I cannot make him happy and I will not make anyone happy ever. I am attention and reassurance seeking, I get so angry at the success of others because I am not good enough. My identity is shattered and especially because now all I can think about is how sad I am. If I am on this downward spiral now, will I ever get out of it?? If I have to live with this any longer, I really do not want to live anymore. Everyday I entertain the idea of being in a car accident because I want people to take care of me and love me but I also hate that I want that and wish so badly to be okay with not needing validation and approval from others. I attempted to overdose recently and all I thought about wa someone finding me dead on the floor and hoping they would feel bad. I could not even think of how this would affect my poor mother who ha been through so much with my ungrateful attenuation seeking ass. Im so grossed out with myself. I am eating at myself and letting myself go, I keep picking and scratching and slapping myself because I do not think I deserve to get better. I deserve to hurt because I am a sad sack of shit who ha NOTHING to be sad about. I have everything I could ever need in life and I am still complaining like an ingrate. I fucking hate myself so much, there is someone out there who deserves my own life more than I do. I am going to start antidepressant I wa prescribed re cently and am in therapy I do not go a often a I probably should and while that is good, I am almost scared of getting better just to get worse again. I am scared of going on antidepressant because I would rather feel so much than feel nothing at all which is my predicament. If this doe not work, if I keep waking up depressed and if I continue to get worse, I really want to just die. I have no friends, they all live far away and I think they only care because I think they can tell I am depressed based on some status I have posted. My boyfriend continues to be loving towards me, but I always feel like he only doe now because he doe not want to hurt me. He say he want me to get better and be more confident, and I cannot help but feel that maybe he deserves someone who is more confident. He reminisces on the past and is always talking about wanting to travel and I cannot help but feel so bad thinking that I will not be involved in those plan because I am not a fun person to be around. People have reassured me that I am more than enough but I am not, I am not I do not believe them. They are just saying that I hate myself so much",0.61

"I might be feeling this way, because I demand too much from myself. I made a similar post about how it could be a sleep problem, but I have a lot of thought in my head, so let me share this, and comment if you think you relate. Basically, I do not want to settle for what my life is right now. I do not want to accept a cheap, easy job. I do not want to accept my poor mental health, and I do not want to take any of the medicine I am given. I do not want to live with my parents. I think my mom is not smart, and my step-dad ha always been an angry alcoholic. I remember the feeling that he hated me ever since my childhood, but then I think he ha trouble understanding people. I do not want to be any of the thing I hate, and I became very hateful ever since that feeling and the mind fog started. I do not know. I felt like I would type more, but it all revolves around money and thing I hate about myself and other people. I just hate the life I have. I feel like I am in a terrible mindset. It is a mindset that doe not let me grow, but make me think I should try a hard a I can to. I also feel insufferably tired lately, hence the sleep issue post on r getting over it.",0.36687
"My formative year were spent in small towns. Until the third grade, I lived in Indiana. From the third grade through my junior year in high school, I lived in a small lakeside community in southwestern Michigan. You could walk or ride your bike to anywhere - down to the lake, out on country roads, wherever. My father wa a Lutheran school teacher, principal and church organist. From time to time, he would take a call to serve in another Lutheran school in a different town. In the summer of , right after my junior year in high school, he decided to take a call to a school in the north side of the city of St. Louis. It wa quite a culture shock for a sheltered young woman who had only lived in small, insular town all her life, to move to a city the size of St. Louis. Quite honestly, when we arrived here I absolutely hated it. I felt a if I would been thrown to the dark side of the moon. I had to start my senior year in a new high school in a completely foreign environment. Everyone else already had their group or circle of friend going back at least three years. Now you had to have a lot more gut and fortitude and self-esteem than I had at the time to break into already established group and make new friends. This wa the year that would set the stage for the first major depressive episode in my life. This wa the year of my first therapist, the first of many to come.

Anyway, the bully now had two child I am having trouble conceiving so that sting , and I think the bully could smell my fear because she headed right to my counter, and began to make a show of how expensive everything wa in our store while also catching up by telling me about how successful she is with her self made interior design business.

"Hi I am Ricky, I am year old and I think I have been living with depression for the past years. I have been through a lot of issue in my life that make my life feel so unbearable and lonely. I have not been through any therapy so I have not been diagnosed with depression but I obviously have not been feeling happy. I am a senior in high school and I hate going to school every morning, I do not feel like I fit in really. Reasons are because I am a social outcast and I do not really like being around other people because I may seem to be off tangent. People seem to judge me too quickly and this really piss me off, or is it that I am way too paranoid. I zone out a lot and just stare at people without even saying a word to any of them. Like I am really anxious around them and I feel completely uncomfortable. I started smoking weed when I wa a sophomore and ever since then people such a my friend seem to drift away but it did not really bother me till now. I do not really have that many close friend other than just friend that I smoke with. My parent say I should avoid those friend just so I can get a better perspective in my life but then I do not know how to make new ones. I really want to make new one because I want to have a better social life but I do not know how to get myself motivated. I want someone to care for like a girl friend, just so that I do not feel so lonely, but then again I do not think I can have a healthy relationship. My parent also say that I should be more open with God but I do not have any faith if I do not even have any faith in myself, how could I have any with God .

"According to the mental health nurse i am not depressed So since october i have been or at least thought I had been depressed. I dropped out of school, started self harming and wa put in hospital twice among other things. I spent nearly the whole of at home doing nothing because I simply could not. I got a full time job in september but I hated it and it made me worse and I had to quit after I started self harming again and have been cutting up until now i am by the way if that is important . Things have been getting worse again recently. I am cutting almost every night and feel down and just cant do anything. I do not even have the energy to shower most day and just stay in bed until the late afternoon. However I wa hopeful for today a I wa going to see a new nurse who I wa hoping would be able to set up a plan to help me. I wa with the child service before and had an amazing nurse who helped me greatly but a i am i am classed a an adult so have to go to the adult services. So a soon a I met the new nurse and we went into the room to talk she told me she know almost nothing about me despite there being many note from the past year. I told her about leaving my job and feeling low and the self harm and everything and what she basically told me is you are not depressed . She said that my self harm wa normal a it wa just scratch and I wa not cutting deep enough to leave any scar which just completely confused me considered i would been put in hospital partly for doing the same thing before. I have also suffered with terrible social anxiety all my life and find it very hard to communicate with others. I told her the only friend i have ever had wa the friend I have made year ago when I first started going to school and what she said wa it sound like I have great social skill a i have been able to make friends. It honestly felt like she wa not listening to a single word I wa saying. As I said she had no note from before and wa basically just assuming what wa wrong with me and that wa it. Also I should add i am in the UK so this is with the NHS so i am not paying for this however my parent have said they would be willing to pay for some session with a therapist if that is wa I need. I am sorry if this is long or it just sound like i am complaining. I just wanted other people opinion on this a I just do not know what to think.",0.23219
"year old male newbie, just discovering that I suffer from depression. While there ha been evidence all throughout my life, and while I have family member that have suffered from depression grandmother committed suicide , I for some reason am just figuring out now that I suffer from the disease. My question for those much more experienced and knowledgeable on the forum. . How would you go about your initial step of diagnosis and treatment? I currently do not have med insurance, so cost is certainly an issue we should have medical insurance in place in about a month, a part of my wife is new employer package . . I take a healthy dose of vitamin daily, including protein such a L-Tyrosine, which help me feel really good when I am not under the effect of depression. Does anyone on the forum have experience with L-Tyrosine and it impact on their feeling of depression? I understand that the amino acid help with the production of dopamine and help with brain function. Any comments? A little background I am just coming off a very successful year period where I started a complicated new business and got married again. However, during these last few month I have been unable to work at my previous pace, putting my business in real jeopardy. In fact, there are only a couple of day per week where I seem to be able to work, and typically only a few hour at a time during those days. When I do work I get exhausted quickly. Today, I had a major conference call that required some preparation. I wa very up during the call, but then collapsed afterward in complete exhaustion. Seems to be the story for me recently, I can psych myself up for short burst of performance, then I quickly decline again in an inability to concentrate on anything other than light web surfing. I continue to get up early and exercise daily. I live a healthy lifestyle, eat well, and walk mile every morning. I sleep regular hours, however, will sleep a few hour during the day during my wouldown days. Looking back at my past, I am now clearly seeing time in my life where my performance level went down drastically, or where I had problem with relationships. At the time, I did not realize anything wa going on, or I simply did not understand it. I can now go recall having real problem with my grade during my freshman year of high school. At the time, I recall saying to myself that I could not understand why I wa performing so badly. It wa a it something wa holding me back and I could not overcome it. At the time, I just kept studying and working harder, but I wa unsuccessful. Eventually, I got through it and my grade went back to normal. But all of these year I never really understood what happened in that freshman year, until now. In summary, there have been many other time in my life where thing have fallen apart and I have not understood why. My past is littered by successful business that I have created and then have eventually failed, usually by my inability to maintain my performance level. There ha obviously been a pattern that I do not yet understand, but at least now I am beginning to see why there wa a downturn. Thankfully, I have now met the woman of every man is dreams. While she know I am depressed I have not yet let her know the depth of my despair or of my recent understanding of my past behavior. The good news here is that I have great family support, but I am wrestling with how much to tell my wife about what is going on inside my head. She get stressed easily and will worry deeply about me. I am not sure I want to lay that all out on her. Anyone else find themselves in this dilemma? Well, thank you for giving me the opportunity to share and to join this forum.",0.3417
"We have been playing Quake almost every night for a little while. We play online against other player using Xbox Live and it is very cool. Most people are friendly. We have made some friend and we find them and play with them. One time I found some person talking too much trash and you can go in a mute them or set a preference to never see them again. Well, last night I encountered a group who had a feud going. One kid wa talking too much trash and people on the other side were just going with it. I figured one game wa a not a big deal. But sometimes you end up finding them again and again in the same night. I have this guy some slack and did not say anything but then later I got to play a part of the same team with him. What a jerk. He kept asking me to give him the flag so he score it and get the point instead of me. Forget about the team winning, this guy wanted all the point for himself and did not care about the team. I had to set him straight, and after the game I had to report him a being a trash player and set in my preference to never see him again. After that I saw the other player and they were all nice. It only take one guy to ruin a great experience. Overall, playing online with all these people and talking with them is great, you just have to know when to cut someone loose. Eventually when many people report him a being a jerk, he will be banned from the game. Oh well.",0.3122

"I can absolutely relate to what you are going through. I understand how difficult it is adjusting to so many different personalities. Ten people in one apartment is overwhelming, to say the least. I used to live with four other girl who had diverse interests, and unfortunately we all kept to ourselves because of the different personalities. It wa best that way. In your case, it seems like you are making a much effort a you can to be social. There is no need to go out on a limb to prove that you are not anti-social. When I had depression I really needed my space and the last thing I wanted to do wa socialize with my roommates. Luckily, I am in my own apartment and have been living alone for three year now. It ha helped enormously. I wonder if you can request a transfer to a bachelor suite where you can live by yourself. I did that in my rd year and the apartment manager put me on a waiting list, and I wa able to get my own living space by November. Even though the moving wa a hassle, I never regretted it. As for finding way to spend time away from the noise of other people, I usually take the bus to visit a bookstore that is far away from campus. I go there every weekend to relax and read. It is away from campus life and it ha helped me sort out my thoughts. The suggestion made by others such a the library, and a park are wonderful too. Maybe you can purchase a bus pass? I have depression and social anxiety, so it wa difficult dealing with the university atmosphere on my own. I made only a couple of friend who have since moved on or graduated. I too saw a school counselor, but it wa short-lived. What helped me, other than getting away from campus, wa getting some online support from forum such a this one. I also kind of clung to one friend at a time, instead of many group of people. I would go to the movie theatre and watch something funny, or I would take long walks. You are not alone.

"I have lost Marines to depression and almsost lost a th. None saw combat. I need help understanding. Hi. I just had my th funeral in year for yet another Marine. A few day ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down. These Marines, a far a i can tell suffer suffered from depression. Pretty much every one of them wa intelligent like way too smart for the Marine Corps and each of them stood out a the funny one . To say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement. The Marine Corps ha done a lot to try and help suicidal Marines, but all our training video depict some clearly distressed person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves. In reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help. What I am asking As someone who ha never suffered depression Ive been depressed but that wa from external factor like a job not working out or a girl leaving me. I consider that normal human emotion , how do I identify Marines under my care thst may be suffering and need help. They are NOT giving the outward sign in the stupid Lance Corporal Decker video we watch once a year. Thanks. Edit been at work all day then went to visit a former Marine that dealt with some serious issue in his day but is doing well now. Mulled over a lot of this with him, then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful responses. I have read every one, some several times. I have a lot to consider and learn, but thank you for helping me find some direction. One thing i did not mention is my role in all this. Im not sone big wig commander with tool at my disposal. Im a newly promoted Sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guy under me. The one we just burried wa not in my platoon, but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss. The other three were guy i wa close to back in training, but i wa not currently stationed with them when it happened. In fact i found out about all three of them on Facebook. This recent one, and the one that called me with suicidal thoughts, have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me. The scary thing to me is, even with hindsight, i would not have picked these five guy out of the lot a having ANY kind of issues, let alone suicidal tendencies. I have also noticed, maybe because of my nature or leadership style, that im the one people tend come to with problems. I make it known that im here for that purpose, and people take me up on it.

"My Mom shot herself. Hi forum, I am going through alot right now and have no idea what to do. I will tell you the story, it a long one.. I hope you are willing to read. I am year old, I wa very close to my mother.. We had a bond that wa a strong a steel. My dad whom she wa with since the age of left her year ago for another woman and found happiness. She had never been with any other man. I have an older sister that is and we had different relationships. My mother wa angry and could never get over my dad, year after year we would hear how much she hated him but still loved him, she would wish they could be one again. It never happened, she had been with no one and remained lonley for years. Her depression became her life, it wa so bad we would stop talking to her because all she would talk about is killing herself and how she hated my dad. year of it, She had little money and wa very sick, She went from healthy to brittle in a matter of years. Back surgery is, aching bones, depression, pain pain and more pain. It became up to me and my sister to take care of her, she could not drive so we always had to drive over to take her to the dr, grocery or to get thing she needed, it became stressfull and we would somtimes bicker over it..even after the divorce my dad helped when he wanted to or could. She started thinking she wa a burden.. then started lashing out on u at times, I went a whole year not speaking to her until she called me to apologize for her horrible word with me. I forgave her and we began a relationship again..this time it wa amazing again, we got along and finally after year she accepted my partner. Long story short drama hit the fan again in early Nov this year. Things were said between her and my sister and they got me involved, I got upset with my mom and she wa so hurt and thought that I thought she wa a liar. My sister told me she said something about my son that she claimed she did not. I did not care after a while, I had plan with her on the day before thanksgiving to go see her.. on the th of NOV. She asked on the th if i could come hook up her VCR so she could watch A Christmas Story, I told her next weekend, then she later that night got upset again, she texted all of u the usual suicide talk. I had told her the day before that I did not want anymore drama, if i went over with my family I did not want to hear about my dad and sister. I just wanted to have a good time. She then texted me and a lot of other family that she loved me. that it wa not my fault, she bought the gun.. I took her to get that gun for protection so I always told her if she did that I would feel to blame She would say SON I bought it! Dont feel to blame I hated that! Still I never belived she would do it.. I wa so bitter about her not wanting to be possitive I hadent called her. I ignored her suicide text and just decided to let her cool off.. th, st-th we hadnt spoken.. I had a bad feeling but didnt know why.. she hadnt called.. so i figured she wa angry with me..

It is awesome but ha issue of it own because I tend to make poor choices, act conceited rude without realizing it, and sometimes get angry. I wa on Zoloft for a short time age - and it made me a little le depressed but caused me to do horrible thing impulsively, act spoiled and stuck up, and have frequent fit of rage. I attempted suicide within the first month of taking meds. I developed anorexia, made poor sexual and financial decisions, and wa fired from my Saturday job a a babysitter because I wa yelling at the kids, teaching them how to swear and bragging about it to other teachers, and trying to flirt with the child is fathers. At school I told everyone I had superpower and raged at them when they said that my superpower were not real. I had argument with my parent and pulled out a knife to threaten them at one point. I had a boyfriend but wa still flirting with other boy constantly including my teachers. I tried to rapebait by going into the house of a suspected molester murderer drug dealer but wa stopped thankfully. After going off med I crashed and burned HARD.

"Hi, I have posted a few response on the forum, but this will be my first thread. I guess I am wondering if I truly suffer from depression or another mental illness. I have not seen a psychologist or a therapist, but I have been reading your thread for the last few weeks. My heart go out to you and I wish that I could lend more support than I can. I know that my situation is not nearly a dire a many of you, but I still ponder whether I have a iproblemi. For the last couple of years, I have experienced an increase in mood swings. I will be doing fine and then a ilight switchi go off, and I get a bad case of the blues. These can last for a few of days. In my mind, I know that everything is actually okay, but I cannot shake the idowni feeling. I also have frequent bout of being istressed-outi. By this I mean that all of the task that I need to get done seem to be insurmountable and that there will never be enough time to get thing done. I sometimes break down in tear during my more manic attack of frustration and worry. Life seems to have become one long list of stuff to do. Even the fun stuff ha become something to get done so that I can move on to the next day. As for itriggersi, a I have been reading about in your posts, I know that I have two major issues. I do not deal well with my emotion when my husband get angry not abusive, just normal iguy angryi or I feel that I have somehow iscrewed-upi and let him down by not doing something right. I turn very inward and the ilight switchi go off. My second issue deal with embarrassment. I do not take embarrassment well. My stress anxiety over getting the housework done stem from my concern that people may come over and I will be embarrassed by the state of the house in fact, the house is always neat and clean, if a bit disheveled by daily life . I often worry about whether I embarrassed myself during social outing or at party with my friends. My husband reassures me, but that doe not usually ease my worry. My ObGyn gave me Sarafem Prozac mg three week ago, and I seem to be operating on a more even keel these days. The low are not a low and I seem to be able to let more stuff just roll off my back. I am pleased with the results, and my husband ha seen a real improvement, but I am still asking myself the basic question a to whether I am indeed ill. Please provide some feedback if you can, a this is the first time that I have tried to really tell folk about how I feel.",0.19

"Beautifully Broken I have spent most of my life afraid to be my true self because I believed that if I did not live up to the standard and norm that I grew up with, I would not be accepted. I wa told since a young age how I should act, talk, and dress. I wa told that money wa important and that attending societal event and bullshit ball wa your key to social success. And those things, trying to feel important, had meant everything to me. But then life screw you over and suddenly your perspective on everything changes. I learned that I no longer wanted to be the person that everyone said I had to be and thing that had once seemed important became trivial. I realized that I did not give a fuck if I had Tory Burch shoe or a Chanel bag. No amount of money could ever bring me happiness, which wa clearly evident in the money that wa spent on I am sorry shopping trip and my therapist. Things started falling apart at home when I wa year old. So my remedy to broken family wa to drink until I could not feel. But despite my new fond love of alcohol and it pain killing effects, I kept my life together. I worked hard in school, I stayed active in my community, and I made sure people thought I wa keeping it together. I could not let everyone know that I wa a fucking mess. But in this process, I slowly lost myself and started living two different lives. When the curtain were wide open, people saw a girl that wa very studious, had many accomplishment is, and always had a smile on her face. But a soon a the curtain closed and I wa alone, my demon came out. And the more I hid, the more I lost myself. At one point, the alcohol wa not enough. Things had only gotten worse at home and I needed a new escape. The first time I did it, it wa a pair of scissors. It wa small, barely noticeable. I had sworn after the first time that I would never hurt myself again. But eventually I did, and when I left for college it had only gotten worse. By my second year of college, I had reached my lowest point. I wa in a toxic, emotionally abusive, relationship. I had a broken relationship with my parents, who spent most of their time stuck in a cycle of fighting, not speaking, and then pretending that they were okay. I had not spoken to my older brother, a struggling addict at the time, in almost a year. I no longer knew who I was. So one night I went out and bought a bottle of wine with my fake ID and went back to my apartment and chugged the entire thing. I sat on my bathroom floor crying, staring at the knife in my hand. And in the back of my mind I thought about the gun that wa a few foot away from me hidden in a book that my dad had given me for protection. For the first time in my life, I had looked at mortality straight in the face. I had questioned it many times, but it wa never like that night. Eventually the cry stopped and the numbness came, a feeling I had become all too familiar with. Would I do it? Could I do it? Would anyone care? I wa consumed with darkness, but there wa a small flicker of light, of hope. I wanted to help people, I wanted to one day to change the world, or at the very least change one person is life. I wa not ready to leave just yet, so I held on to the tiny amount of hope that wa left in me. I called the cop and wa admitted into a psychiatric center. I spent hour in a white walled, emotionless, prison like place. And not once did someone ask me if I wa okay. My parent came up to see me and had a difficult time accepting what had happened and I did not understand why. They knew I wanted help, they saw the scar on my arms, and they knew that I wa not okay. They blamed my relationship with my then boyfriend and told me to never speak of this to anyone. They did not want people to know I wa crazy . Was I? During that time, I came to believe I was, but now I understand that I wa just broken. It is been over three year since that happened and although I still struggled with a lot after that, I am now in a better place. The reason I am writing this is because I promised myself to one day help the -year-old me whose cry for help where tossed to the side, who wa told she wa over-dramatic and crazy, and who thought that cutting wa the only way to cope. There wa a reason I grew up surrounded by mental illness. I watched not only myself go through it, but I saw my brother, my parents, my friends, and so many people on the news struggling with their own demons. And this did not happen because life felt like fucking me over, it wa just trying to show me what my reason for living is. I spent year ashamed of the person I wa because I wa scared to show people my true, raw, fucked up self. But is not that the problem? When it come to having a mental illness, we believe the stigma that come attached to it and we are afraid to speak up and talk about it. And the people who are lucky enough to not experience it, do not want to talk about it either. The only difference from how mental illness wa treated a hundred year ago and now, is that we no longer hide and chain our family member in basement or attics, but the shame and embarrassment is still there. And I want to change that. I want to remove the stigma and stereotype attached to mental illness and get people talking. But change start with me, and that mean that I cannot be afraid to share my experiences. This is who I am and I would not change my life for anything in the world because now I truly understand what it is like to live with a mental illness. I finally know what the difference between sympathy and empathy is, and that is one of the greatest gift that could have come out from this. I will be exploring different topic on mental illness while trying to find way to change the way people think and talk about it. I will not only be looking at the psychological background of mental illness, but the neurological background a well. More and more scientist are publishing article on different alternative treatment that do not involve medications. One of my favorite topics, which I will soon explore in more detail, is neuroplasticity, or the brain way of re-wiring itself to create new circuits, and essentially a new you. I have set a goal to one day create a facility for those who are afflicted with a mental illness. But instead of white walls, cold stare from employees, and isolation, they will be surrounded by beautiful colors, the outdoors, and people who actually care. Our current mental health system is completely and utterly fucked up. We cannot keep over-medicating people and throwing them out into the world with absolutely no regard for their actual well-being. If these treatment were actually working, we would not be seeing an alarmingly increasing rate of mental illness. It is time to re-define mental illness and stick a middle finger up to all the people who tell you that you are crazy or different. And maybe I am crazy, I am sure a hell different, but that doe not make me any le of a person. I am proud of who I have become and now I know what the purpose of my life is, and I am not going to stop chasing it. -RBZ Sometimes the most beautiful people are beautifully broken -r.m. drake",0.0

"Unmotivated to be anymore Looking at my life from an objective point of view right now I have a lot of shit to do. I have no intention on doing any of it though.

I feel like the only thing I do care about is what people think of me which fuckin suck not gonna lie. I take so much offense to someone not liking me in every way, yet I am too fucking unmotivated and indifferent to make myself better.

"Medicines can and do stop working. I am going though this right now. I suffer from chronic depression. Had it since I wa and I am now so I have been suffering for years. God, I never realized how long it was! I sat in therapy for year after my ex attempted to hang himself. I saved his life by taking him down from the noose with the help of my brother. The first word out of his mouth when he wa out of his coma and the swelling went down wa that it wa all my fault. I knew then it wa ME who needed the help. So for year I sat in therapy and they never diagnosed me with chronic depression. If they did, they never told me or put me on medicines. When I switched therapists, that wa when she said that I needed medicines. They gave me Prozac. That made a HUGE difference after the first weeks. I took that for years. Then I had gastric bypass surgery and when you have that, your body doe not absorb the same so it stopped working.

"Told my mother I tried to kill myself, she admitted she also tried when i wa a baby. I have been struggling with this sickness for a while, it cost me my job, and a few friends, but only now i can publicly say that i tried to kill myself on the th of February. I tried to hang myself with a belt, fortunatelly i bought a really shitty one at primark and the only thing it did wa leave me on the floor gasping desperatelly for air, filled with a sense of failure and a huge shame. I have always been an outgoing, funny, talkative and very active guy and i just felt a is i runned out of batery like something wa leaving me without lifeforce. After some therapy i decided to tell my mother about this. I went for a visit to my parent house and waited until we were alone to tell her basically what i have been writing above. Also told her that the biggest fear i had before doing it wa that if i died my mother would also died just out of pure sadness. After we both cried for a while she dropped the bomb. She had been struggling with depression all her life without me or my sister knowing about it and it came a point where she even tried of doing the same. The thing that stopped her wa their child and what we would do with and year alone. She also told me that my grandfather did not die of cancer, apparently he wa an alcoholic, and when we where kid he threw himself at the well they had on the backyard. All this just made me realize that people do not kill themselves, depression kill people the same way cancer does. People who have not struggled with this cannot even imagine what is living with depression and often blame a person who is basically ill. My mother also gave me the best advice i have ever recieved. She told me that I wa not on this earth just to find a job and live the best way i could just by buying things, that it did not matter if i did not find a huge reason to live just by being there i wa already the reason for my mother and many others to live and be happy, the same way she wa for me. That even just by smiling at the guy at the supermarket i wa already making him a bit happier even though it would only be a few seconds, and that should be enough. Thanks for listening guy",0.27169
Friends Im in year and i already feel like a failure. My friend never invite me out with them and recently ive felt like ive not even been wanted to hang out with them at break time and lunchtime. all they do is take the piss out of me and no one else.

I have never felt more alone in my life and I do not know what to do about it. I recently graduated high school with a decent amount of friend but have only really kept in touch with about of them. I am going to a college two hour away so the likelihood that I will be able to even see those people is kind of dwindling once I move. I used to deal with loneliness through friend on PlayStation but even those relationship feel like they are getting distant. I recently started talking to my former best friend from PS whom I have known for about year but ever since he started seeing someone it feel like he is gotten meaner to me and doe not care to be there for me in the same way anymore. I am not sure if I am depressed but I have never felt more alone or lost or confused in my life. I have managed to convince myself that I have no redeeming quality and that my friend are only pretending to like me because they feel bad or somehow feel obligated to maintain a facade of friendship. I just want to feel important to someone. Or at least okay enough with myself that I do not need the validation of a relationship to feel valuable.,0.29125
"Why am I like this? Every time I try to step out of my comfort zone and try to be more outgoing normal so people will think a little better of me perhaps, I just completely fuck everything up. I do not even feel like leaving my bed anymore. Why I am posting this right niw I somehow convinced a girl that I am not a complete idiot, and we are together. Since she is ill, I thought I would swing by and give her a little get well soon kit with soup, tea, chocolate, that kinda stuff. All that came back wa a half assed thank you, no comment on anything in the damn thing I have planned for a week now. I did not expect much reaction, since she doe not seem to like spending time with me anyways, but a little more would have been nice. I guess I am just bad at everything I touch.

I wrote her letter a a secret admirer , the ending of the letter wa always the same To the world you might be one person, but to one person you might be the world.

"Hello everyone, I am new here. I am Sarah and in my early thirties. I live in Europe and found this forum today! I just want to share my thought and because I wa afraid anyone would find out about my feeling I searched for a foreign forum. And found it! I have been struggling all my life but after a series of event death of dear aunt and suicide attempt off parent I found myself starting therapy almost year ago. At first everything wa fine and I wa learning a lot about myself and how to make my life easier and how to love myself. i really wa hopeful and thought my life would finally get happier and maybe I would even meet some one to share my life with.. After a year of therapy I started feeling worse about myself and developed an eating disorder and a few month ago I also started feeling more and more depressed. At first I denied everything and even threatened to quit therapy because I wa convinced time would heal me..well I now know that healing is not that easy. over the past two week I have been to a psychiatrist who want to start me on Prozac because it should not make me gain weight, she think this would be the best ad. for me and earlier this week i went to see my usual psychotherapist who said I wa severely depressed and she urged me to start taking the medication because of my state of mind. I might loose my job in the near future and with all this extra stress my thought have been very scary. I am starting to think more and more about death and for this reason my therapist started talking about hospitalization! Off course I do not want that so I agreed earlier today to start with the medication..I am so scared about the side effect and do not know what i will do if I gain weight. Also I do not think I want to life if I loose my job..I think that will push me over the edge. I hope I can find the energy to read more message on this board and maybe get a good feeling about life again. Bye for now, Sarah",0.34258000000000005
"Hi all.. this is going to be a long post, but I would really like some feedback on it.. I am kind of young, . I am currently involved in a relationship long distance with a boy who is a year older than me, and I love him more than word can say. The thing is, though, I am a very depressed person sometimes. I do not know if I am making this up or if I actually read this somewhere, but I am what I have heard classified a a seasonally depressed person I experience depression more during the winter month December through February than I do any other time of the year. I have a lot of family problem that compound to my depression a well. When I wa , I moved halfway across the country and I never accepted living here. I am a city-girl, but I moved to the country. I feel isolated and alone out here, and I do not have anyone to talk to. My mother told me to buck up and get over it when I went to her about my depression a couple of year ago. She is currently on medication for her own depression. My father ha a crippled arm which he gained when we moved here and ha some addiction problems, so I do not go to him. I have a very hard time trusting people. My mother and father were both abused a children, and my mother verbally abuse me. Recently, starting in about December, I started wanting to hurt myself physically again. The urge faded, but the depression lingered. For a while I have been emulating my mother on my boyfriend--I keep taking out my own anger and my own depression on him. I am afraid that if I keep up with this behavior, I am going to lose my boyfriend to my own selfishness. A lot of the time I wish I could disappear. I do not like being seen by people and I like to be alone, but at the same time I feel isolated in my soul. I tried religion, but I cannot bring myself to place my faith in something I cannot see. I am really afraid that my depression is going to cause me to lose the one thing I even care about at all anymore in the world. I do not know what to do. My parent will not help me, my teacher do not know how to deal with it, and I have been to depression forum like this before and they really helped. I guess all I am looking for is someone to lean on while I get through the winter months.

"This message is especially for newcomer desperately seeking a way out of the depression rut. Please read my word carefully a a lot of thought and devotion went into this A year ago, I wa stuck in the miserable rut of depression with little or no hope of finding a way out. I wa attending mandatory group therapy after an attempted suicide and miserable hour in the nut house. They put me on Remeron which helped a little .. taking some of the edge off the suicidal thoughts, but little else. Weeks of trying to learn cognitive behavior therapy went by and hope of getting better were dwindling. Then one day, my best friend gave me a book which taught me how to properly apply the CBT. Many of you have tried CBT to no avail. I sincerely believe that you did not do it either properly, hard enough, and or long enough. When retraining the mind, it is vitally important to diligently apply CBT daily for several weeks. See my webpage for more info Antidepressant That Works . Once this becomes a regular habit, I am confident you will see improvement a I did. I am positive you can do it too. It wa the toughest job I have ever had to do, but it sure wa worth it. Whenever a negative situation present itself now, I just block it out and replace it with a positive thought automatically. It is hard in the beginning, but it is totally do - able. Plus, it get easier after awhile. Then, once it becomes automatic, you do not even have to think about it. Properly applied CBT help tremendously, but it is not a complete cure a you will see in my story. You must also take care of your body because it is what furnishes your brain with the proper nutrients. The two go hand in hand. The brain regulates the endocrine system and the neurotransmitter while the body provides the brain with the proper chemical to do it job. Leisure activity help also. I know it is difficult for some of you to have fun, but it is important to get your mind off your problem even if just for a little while. I mention motivation in my story. Sometimes you just have to force yourself to do what is good for you even if you do not want to. Contrary to what many believe, motivation begin with action .. not visa - versa. The sooner you begin to properly apply the technique I learned and the more effort you put in to them, the sooner you will get better. Hopelessness and doubt will be your enemy, so try to put them aside for a month a you get on the road to wellness. I have been off antidepressant for almost a year now. I feel great .. plus my concentration and comprehension are back. March marked my one year anniversary without alcohol too. I am basically drug free and am a happy a I wa year ago before the depression nearly ruined my life.",0.23315999999999998

"I am new here. I am from Australia, I am year old next month, married with a . year - old daughter and a baby son on the way. I work in Insolvency liquidation etc . I have been on antidepressant medication on and off for about year now initially Aropax, now Aurorix , in hindsight I have actually suffered from depression for my entire life. I am a similar personality to my mother who also suffers from depression. My younger brother and sister seem to have drawn the long straw a such, they seem not to be affected. Things went downhill for me about the time I started on medication. I wa in the early stage of a major gambling problem, and untreated depression had led to a real strain on my marriage. We split up for month during which time I made lame suicide attempt , reunited and seemed to get back on track, having our first child. Throughout this time the gambling problem intensified, and spiraled out of control to the point where I am now a bankrupt. During this time I also became extremely withdrawn to the point where I hate leaving our house and am more or le unable to cope with spending time with anyone except my wife and daughter. I also had something of a breakdown about month ago, quit my job, which led to great tension between me and my wife spending together , eventually she could not cope and moved out. Shortly after we worked it out and I moved in with her. Things seem pretty good now, we are a lot more relaxed about thing and we just seem to get along better, looking forward very much to the birth of our second, in about week time. My gambling problem is pretty much dealt with thanks chiefly to having little money and no access to it now but I am still depressed, withdrawn and generally tired of life. To be honest, I am only around because of my wife and daughter, I feel little reason to exist other than for them. I am also a christian and this is very hard, because there is a real burden of I should not feel this way, I should be happy . This lead to more depression, and at the moment I am reluctant to go to church, I do not pray or read the bible. I am generally resentful of anyone who I consider to have a better existence than me which is just about everyone . So while thing are quite stable at home, I personally am at my lowest point in some respects. I am quite intelligent and every employer I have ever had ha commented on my abundance of potential but lack of drive. So true, I lack any kind of ambition and harbor something of an extreme opposition to materialism and the pursuit of money and possession and even now am tossing up whether to continue working. I have a chief interest i.e. motorsport , but other interest have been decimated e.g. I used to be quite a good pianist but now have absolutely no desire to play. I also cannot get the motivation up to get involved in playing sport, which in the past ha been a big part of my life. So that is me in a nutshell. My extreme difficulty in taking on face to face help relationship ha driven me to get involved in some online depression forum a I think this may be a good way for me to start some kind of recovery.",0.27166999999999997
"Things that I liked about today so far Maybe the only way to escape depression is gratitude. Cicero, one of the senator of Rome in the early day of the empire is quoted to have said Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others. I liked waking up early and going to the gym on an intense pre workout. I like stepping outside in the cold to smoke and feel the warmth when I re-enter the building. I like seeing the tree trying to survive the winter, how splendorous they are. In them I see people going through hard time and the beauty that exists within them. I liked logging on to Runescape to escape reality for a couple of hour and talking to my friend on there. The fact that we have escape is an amazing thing. I liked seeing three girl meet each other outside and say Hii how are youu? and compliment each other. Instead of normally being irritated by that, I actually admired that people in reality share bond and happiness with each other is presence, and it made me happy to see that. I like the complexity of the mathematics that I am doing and the fact that I am doing it. I like having a planned meeting with a group of people today for my class presentation in college. I like having a picture of a God who constantly forgives and is deeply saddened by our unhappiness that becomes to hard to bear for some, versus a picture of an angry Colonel with zero mercy. I like the fact that I have a place to resort to to write down the thought streaming from my mind.

Basically from middle school to about a year ago when I finally started on medication. The best way I could describe my depression is voice in my head saying mean and awful thing to me, about me, about what other people are thinking or saying about me, turning positive into negative etc. I started playing a game called Hellblade Senua is Sacrifice tonight and the their is a theme around psychosis, and the main character ha many voice in her head. Here is the opening, possible trigger warning? , As soon a I heard all the voice calling Senua names, putting her down, laughing at her etc. I wa like holy shit that wa me. I am not trying to say I have had psychosis, I just thought that the voice thing felt like what I went through. My voice, telling me terrible things, spinning stories, like someone else in my head, working against me. Anyone else feel like Senua me?",0.244

My best friend used to always be there for me, he wa the barnyard kind of personality, with tonne of love and compassion for everyone around him, and along him wa excitement and exploration. We used to explore the wood together and sometimes sit and stare at the campfire for hour until we fell asleep together. His name wa Archer, he wa my cat, and he wa my best friend. A woodland animal killed him, he wa defenseless.. I have tried with different cat to fill the empty void, but they were never aware of me. Archer wa always where I was, and were going.

"People are NOT who they seem. I originally wrote a long post detailing the specific of what just happened to me, but I decided not to. All I am saying is, do not trust anybody. You have zero assurance that people who act nice and fine when you are around are really nice and fine towards you when your back is turned. I would not have known the true, judgmental, and frankly I have no fucking idea where in the as of God did they pull all their judgmental shit - if I had not snooped and read text message of my mother to other people. Hell, my own mother is in it, too! Hide the knife, he might stab our son my stepfather . You are sick, go to a doctor for a checkup. You cannot give up, please do not die. We pity your son. He cannot survive without you. He will burn all the money with booze. He will be homeless and sleep on the streets. Jesus Fucking Christ. What in the actual fuck? I do not even drink. Jesus Christ. What the fuck. The judgment. Dear fucking Christ I could not believe nor comprehend how this people even came to whatever bullshit thought idea they came to. Suddenly, I am back down to self-doubt and I can feel depression clawing at me, it is trying to rip me apart again. But, no more. I am pushing it back. I have confirmed EVERYTIME, that family is my main source of toxicity. FUCK THAT. I am being ganged up on by everyone in this house, and their relatives, and every single one of my relatives. I once questioned if I wa the one at fault. I mean, if EVERYBODY hated you, you are probably doing something wrong. UNLESS, you are just that damn unlucky and every single one of your relative is a fucking asshole. I have heard of those story before, so it is not impossible - and I think that is the case with me. Jesus. For now, I am playing the game they wanna play. They wanna be fake with me, I will be fake with them. I act all fine and dandy around my mother and everyone else. I smile, I joke. All a facade. So when the right time comes, when I can finally burn bridge with them, it will fucking hurt mom. Mom, yes. Because everyone else would be glad I am gone. But, my mother, will hopefully finally realize her fucking mistake and die a fucking failure of a mother.",0.33687

That is when i discovered cutting myself. It started off a what doe it feel like then grew into and addiction. I used to be doing it nearly everyday. IT made make me feel like there is nothing wrong. Well this grew bigger and bigger and i did not tell anyone about it. After about month i started to lie to myself and say everything wa fine, It worked. Only temporarily. Around month ago the feeling came back and i still have them at this moment. I have researched a lot about clinical depression. I still cut and i hate it. I came right out to my parent and said Maybe i enjoy cutting myself when we were in a huge fight. My dad turned around and said we do not care if you cut yourself . This definitely did not help. So right now i have one person i can talk to about it and ha a good friend of mine. I checked the symptom of clinical depression on Answers.com and i have of them. I need to go see a doctor i know but i just cannot. There is something stopping me and i do not know what it is. I just want to solve it on my own but i cannot. I need Help.

"I do not want to be an adult anymore. I have been struggling with my depression a lot lately and I really really wish I could turn to one of my parent to tell them how much I am struggling. More importantly, I wish I could tell one of them and one of them cared. I know I am a decent disappointment to both of them for several reasons. I have not had a decent job. I have been floating on job that get me le than five hour a week. I do not have friends. Granted, that is because my mother literally and intentionally isolated me so I have no social skill at all. I have big dream but zero motivation in life so I cannot even try to achieve them. So what I am trying to do is work on myself. Today I started a new third, I now have three of these stupid thing job. I thought I did pretty good considering the store did not burn down and no one told me that I wa a failure. But literally a soon a the sun set, I feel all my doubt and darkness telling that I am lying to myself. That I am being naive by thinking that I did well, that I wa probably a huge burden to everyone else in the store. But I am trying, so that ha to count for something right? I went and got a third job on my own, so why do not I feel like I should be proud of myself? I have no friends. In fact, during , I wa so excited to have made a great friend and I wa completely betrayed by them. The kind of betrayal where I walked away from a friendship and have not bothered reading the apology they have sent me. I have tried reconnecting with friend that I had earlier in life, but I am not doing so well. I feel like they will do something to me and then I will lose another friend. And logically, if I am the only common factor in all my failed friendships, then I must be the problem, right? I must be the problem. I am the problem. Maybe I am not meant to have friends. And I have always had big dream for myself. But because of how I wa raised, I have no accountability. Because seriously, why bother trying if everything I do is going to be met with disapproval and anger? So I have been trying really hard to make myself follow at least one goal. I chose to go for my art. Problem being that with my depression crashing on me in waves, I am really struggling to stick to my goal of one art post a day. I am trying really hard but I am so afraid that I will be the failure I wa taught to be. In all of this, I just really really wish I could quit trying to be an adult and go back to the day when I believed my mom when she said she loved me, I want to go back to when my dad wanted to help me talk thing out so I could figure out what I wa doing. I want to be able to call my mom up and tell her that I feel like a complete failure and that I cannot add to see my therapist and that I need help talking the darkness down. But if I call her, she will one-up me because I am the biggest mistake of her life. Or worse, she will tell me that I should try fill in the blank with whatever b Facebook depression fix is trending . I want to be able to call my mom and say hey, I got another job and I am excited. I want her to tell me that she is proud of me. I really want to have a conversation with my dad that doe not involve the phrase well get over it . Hey dad, I am full of regret and turmoil ugh just get over it well excuse me sir for being by the reality that I just pulled a mulan and cut all my hair off so that I could get another job. I went from having shoulder length hair that made me feel good about myself to hair that is half an inch long and highlight everything about my face that give me horrible anxiety. Maybe I am really hurting because I went in to work yesterday and two of my manager greeted me with ew gross, what happened to your hair? And now I feel like I am a ugly a I think I am. I really miss being a kid when I could pretend that my world wa not on fire or that I wa not drowning. And I do not know how to make any of the darkness back up so that I can breathe.

"Desperate for advice or input I lost and am losing everything held dear to me right now due to multiple reasons, and would just like to hear some different recommendation I DON T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DONT KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG OR HOW TO FEEL BETTER!! I have typed this out way too many time so I am gonna do my best to sum it up a short a I can Last week me and my gf of and a half month broke up, i wa devestated. In that little time I have experienced more love, more of life than ever before and it felt like we would been together forever. I thought, maybe we would work thing out on our own and get back together when the time wa right, even though i knew it wa a stretch, but i wa also okay with just being friend if that wa what the world had planned. day after the break up im talking to both of my best friend who are also kinda? friend with her, and they both tell me that she basically told them she had absolutely no intention of ever getting back with me because she wanted to ho around without the commitment of a relationship. She also openly bragged to one of them that she had cheated on me multiple time during our relationship. This all made me very angry and on top of that hurt. The same night just after finding all of this out I find out from my other friend that she had called her and bragged about hooking up with this one kid who, during our entire relationship, she told me she hated and that we BOTH already had bad history with, and fooled around. Then later AGAIN she go on instagram live with my bestfriend who is kinda being fake just to see how she really is and openly brag about blocking me which added to the hurt cause i had done nothing but try to respect her wish since the split in hope that we could at least part on good term ya know , saying that i wa fucking crazy and that she never wanted anything to do with me ever again. There is more in term of detail but thats the basic general idea of the past week for me. I dont know how i feel or what to say. I feel hurt and i feel abandoned and i feel stupid and i feel not good enough and i feel like a complete fuck up i feel so fucking awful it not even funny. Im losing my friend because my stupid brain cant get over this and im constantly going to them to talk about it because that is the way i like to deal with stuff, but they have heard the same thing one too many time and i get that i just dont know what else to do. Im tired of thinking about it, im tired of not being able to confront her but my friend say it not a good idea because it not gonna do anything but make her think even higher of herself for having fucked me up so badly and wont at all make her change her ways. I want to completely forget but at the same time a part of me want to work everything out just so i can mean something to this person who meant absolutely everything to me at one point again, WHY?? Why doe my brain, or heart, or whatever still crave attention from her, or maybe even her herself, even after knowing all of this? Why am i so fucking pathetic? What can I do to move on that doe not involve just ignoring the problem and moving forward but rather coming to peace with it and myself and blossoming? Please, all and every opinion or suggestion is welcome. Thank you if you took the time to read this and I wish everybody the best of luck with your own problem no matter what they be.

"My boring sob story Family member told me all the time that being an adult is shit and I should make the most of being a kid. So when depression hit me I thought it wa normal, but it did not feel right. I wa not upset all the time, it wa just like a flat misery sort of feeling. Things started to feel odd for me, certain sound and smell and silly thing like the wind of my face felt wrong. Like they would be toned down somehow. Eventually I became completely disconnected from my emotions, save for the occasional moment when I actually find something funny. I have been on two type of medication and had therapy too, neither of which did anything for me. I did not notice myself become so gradually withdrawn from everything. Now going to the shop or getting the bus is something I would rather not do. Things I would do every day. My social life went backwards a well a my social skills. Now I am afraid to talk to people. I literally reject girl I am interested in on the spot, before I even have chance to fuck it up myself. Things that I would do without thinking now take encouragement and energy. Then came the cynicism. Belief that nobody out there wa pure and everything they did wa for their own personal gain. Suppose it is true in a sense but I wish I did not have this paint everybody with the same brush mindset. It is hard to believe I am the same person at times. It is been year now and I have had enough. Just dunno what to do. I feel like I have tried everything.

Only to be honest I sometimes choose i think to be down and out all the time. I wa in recovery from a drug problem for year and i developed a relationship with a Higher Power that really really helped with my depression anxiety addictions. So it would be insane for someone who know the solution to not use it right? Well i have heard it said before, that once someone who had great faith loses it it make it more difficult for that person to find hope or faith, so that is where i have been the past months, hopeless. I tried Heroin after year clean. Looking for something to shut my mind up and find some comfortable peace due to my increasing loneliness and depression.

Then i moved back with my mom who ha deep anger at my dad and life i guess who is with a man that is using her in my opinion, he is in a halfway house and just lay on her couch all day. And my dad ha deep depression bipolar on every medication you could think of and life with his mom who only talk about the divorce and how i should have did this different So really if i look at it long enough and deep enough they are alive but dead in a healthy emotional, spiritual, mental level, so where is the encouragement or love i so long needed a a younger person, and even most importantly i need some guidance now, instead of being ashamed of who they are. I just need to vent. I am i just started college last week and i am extremely anxious when there, I feel a though i wear a suit, outfit, costume of misery, fear, depression, THE VOID. So it drive others away, plus i am ashamed of being a depressive anxious dude so keeping others away is my aim. I mean i am i should be getting laid and having fun right?!

I talked to a friend of mine that is at Yale in Connecticut last night who ha always been a good natured, smart, artistic guy, and a person who experience depression but doe not let it get the best of him, and he said to not dwell in the negative like i have always done, find something through out the day that is positive, a girl smile at you, a song whatever.

She life a few hour from me and is being watched closely right now, but I plan on going out to visit her this weekend. To be honest, she ha a horrible living situation. My aunt her mom is awful. To my aunt, every problem can be solved by God, she is financially fucked and letting it out on my cousins, and she is extremely dismissive of my cousin feelings, needs, and emotions. It also doe not help that my cousin is adopted, and I know she just feel detached from her own family. Anyways, I know that there is no such thing a simply getting your advice on how to fix my cousin depression. I know how complex of an issue this is. What I want to know from you all is if there is anything I can do this weekend to just show her that thing can get better. My little cousin ha always looked up to me, and I plan on taking her out to do some of the thing that she always want to do like go to the park, make slime, whatever year old like . But is there anything extra I can do? Is there anything that you all wish someone told you? Or maybe even something you wish they did not? I would really appreciate any tip or advice you all have for me this weekend. I know my cousin ha a very long road ahead of her, but I want to do anything I can to make it easier.

I am beginning to not give a crap anymore about depression being viewed a just a woman issue it is what it is and to heck with gender stereotypes. The thing I have noticed the most are my friend unwillingness to consult a therapist or take medication, but perhaps their bout of depression are not the bed-ridden variety that I have gone through. Or maybe this is their way of not feeling completely weak . Most of my friend will either drink excessively or take drug to deal with this stuff. I tried to drink it all away, but in the end it just made me feel worse. I tried tranquilizers, but that did not work. I tried booze and pill together, but still the depression lingered.

When will this inescapable wait ever end? I feel a though this is never ending and nothing good will ever come out of it. I am underserving. I have both a long-term mental illness and a long-term physical illness. One is willpower is limited. I struggle everyday both physically and mentally emotionally. It is been years. My physical illness affect my mental illness and vice versa but they are offend uncontrollable! I suffer from chronic low self-esteem due to my illnesses. I do not know I just feel hopeless and helpless. My willpower feel drained. I do not know how much longer I can keep holding on. It is not holding on that is difficult. What is difficult is holding on when there may be no meaning to it. What if I hold on with all my will and I find out there is nothing to it. My whole life would have just been meaningless suffering. I keep trying but sometimes it is really hard and I am scared and lonely.,0.0

"From the life I know. All I can say is, I know that after all we have been through. AND without preaching I know that you know that whatever your child choose in the path to lead you will support. BUT and HOWEVER I have many friend from all walk of life. And we all share the same childhood in more way than not. And in any case, not one of our childhood ha sculpted who we are today, some of u on one side of the line some on the other.. My father while eating dinner with my brother and I for the first time in year last night while meeting new friend and people made a very correct statement.. While my little brother is the marine and I being whatever I might be am the emotional one, THIS IS TRUE and yet my father ha NO clue about my emotional status, issue what not.. Just because one is emotional doe not mean that his path is chosen. I am going to stop being politically correct and y all know what I mean or at least I hope so. I guess a I have lost my train of thought crazy in the brain? All I can say is just make sure that the kid grow up and learn to take care of themselves, never to rely on someone else to always make sure that they are taken care of.. In essence learn to wipe your own as or you are going to be sorry because one day that as wiper is going to be gone.. Keep being the parent you are and you will all make it out ok!

"The Irony of Loneliness in an Overpopulated World As I spend more time in the presence of depression, I have tried to apply a further focus to understand what is actually going on in my head. Dealing with the sudden appearance of depression ha been a nightmare and a half to deal with to say the least. So in response, I regularly attempt to interpret the spiral of self loathing thought and whirlwind of emotion that march throughout my mind. My initial reaction to a diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempt ha been to run away from everything that reek of painful memories, both theoretically and literally I write this post , kilometre from my home country, in Japan, where I aim to live for the next couple of years. I have ghosted those whom I use to call my close friends. I left all social medium in order to avoid contacting people that I knew, and because looking at how happy other people were brought me down. I changed my image drastically over the past year a an outward expression of the fact that I am trying to change a a person. It is here in Japan that I have come to a terrifying realisation. I cannot run from depression. Here I am, in a country where people speak a totally different language and immersed in a totally different culture to my own, writing a post about depression. Recently, I wa walking the street in search for job opportunity when I sunk into a depressed mood and began thinking about my place in the world which always turn out well . Nothing actually matters. We work in order to pay rent, in order to stay in the same place, so that we can reliably keep a job so that we can pay rent. It is in this meaninglessness that human a social being look to others for comfort. Our life are but a meaningless speck in an expanding universe. That is quite the depressing thought.. And it is. But why is it that when another body is lying on top of mine, or when I am held in a warm embrace, this thought doe not have any impact on me? I have done quite a bit of thinking by myself, and have talked to a bunch of people from back in the psychiatric ward on what fix us. And the unfortunate answer for most of u is.. Nothing. We cannot be fixed. It is just how our mind work. But what if we do not have to be fixed? The hardest part about depression for me, is the intensity of the loneliness I feel. When I am at my worst, I am so focused on my own loneliness and the meaninglessness of my relationships, that the few connection I do have, I dismiss. Now, this is not the case for all people suffering from depression. For a lot of people, their negative emotion are driven by a sense of worthlessness, meaninglessness or sadness. But the general consensus is, although we cannot fix ourselves, we can have people around u to support u when we are at our lowest. And it make sense that a social beings, human intimacy provides u with a safety net for when depression is hitting u the hardest. Unfortunately for most of us, the type of physical and emotional intimacy that we strive for is unobtainable. In my life, depression is caused me to push away the people that I have spent time building connection with, and ha limited the amount of contact I have had with stranger and people that I COULD connect with. I think it is ironic. It is ironic that in such an overpopulated world, depression is such a big issue. We are the people that need intimacy the most, so you would think we would be in a position where intimacy is more readily available. But that is not how the world works. Our life are still meaningless. We still hate ourselves. And we are still alone.",0.33752000000000004

"Why depression is, and is not like a skinned knee Some thought I had that I wanted to share I wa just pondering depression, and I decided to jot down what I wa thinking. It is sort of a good way to put word to what it feel like to suffer from depression. Why it IS like a skinned knee Depression usually come in episode for me, and a lot of people I have talked to. Sometimes I will be doing okay, and then have a really bad day, or even a bad week. These episode are sort of like skinning your knee. When you were little, skinning your knee feel like the absolute worst thing in the world. You think, OW, THIS HURTS SO MUCH! WHAT S HAPPENING TO ME?! You feel so helpless. When you are an adult and skin your knee, you know what to do. You know that you are supposed to clean it, and put a bandage on it. And that is exactly what you do you do not make a fuss. But, even though you clean it and bandage it, it is of course still going to hurt. It is a cut. You just ignore the pain, though, because you have already taken care of it, and there is not much else you can do beyond that. You just have to live with the fact that it is going to hurt for a while. Depression is the exact same way. When it happens, you know what you should do to handle it. The best way, backed by science and research, is what we have all heard countless time Exercise, eat healthy, do something nice for yourself, clean your living space, listen to happy music, watch TV show that make you happy, etc. So you know to do this stuff. But of course, it is not going to magically feel better right off the bat. There is still that emotional pain there, just like the way a skinned knee stings. But you have already done everything you can to take care of it, so you have to live with it and wait patiently for the pain to go away. Why depression ISN T like a skinned knee Most people know that depression ha a way of demotivating sufferers. Things you once enjoyed no longer interest you. Nothing seems like it ha a point. But this also affect your drive to treat your depression. When you skin your knee, you just take care of it right away, you do not give any second thought to it. It is just what you do. With depression, you know that you should be exercising, eating healthy, listening to happy music, cleaning, etc. But you do not. What is the point? The difference is, that depression make you NOT want to get better, or more accurately, not care about getting better. Sometimes, you are just apathetic and nihilistic, What is the point? I do not care. Getting better is too much effort. Sometimes, you just want to wallow in your own despair. For me, when I feel this way, it is because I feel worthless and self-loathing. I think, I deserve to feel this way. I deserve this emotional pain that I am going through. I do not deserve to feel better, or to be happy. That is the vicious cycle that depression us to keep you down. If you are reading this and have depression, I hope this help you understand your own illness a little more clearly. If you are reading this and you do not have depression, I hope this give you a good account of what it is like, so you can empathize with people who have depression. Stay safe, everyone.",0.25903000000000004

"Falling for someone you have no chance to be with Warning Super long read Have you ever fallen for someone that you know you have absolutely no chance with? It is been year since I have fallen for a girl back in college, which ended up in heartbreak and depression because she already found someone else. I have lost all motivation and my passion for art I am an art student , failed my thesis which sent me into another dark place, friend were not even there to help me get up, and for the remaining year I had in college, the thing that kept me going are my parents, I just wanted to survive for them. I have lost all emotions, the flame that wa once burning in my heart, the excitement I had when I wa a freshman. I graduated college month ago and found work not related to the course I took up, it felt really low, but I just wanted to survive. Training for work now, did not want to make friend again, had one, but he did not liked the people so he left in a few weeks, the only thing in my mind wa to focus and be better for this job to survive. Avoided lunch and hanging out with workmates, and did not really reveal much about myself aside from having a mundane life. The trainer were aware of my introversion and decided to have random sitting arrangement every week so we could get to know our workmate more, and I could get to talk about other stuff aside from work. week in training and still, I did not made any connections, I only help out my workmate professionally, point out mistake and the next step they should take. I get to be sit mate with the liveliest girl in training, playful and have a contagious happy aura ? . There were also a few talk and laugh about work related stuff, but I did not really made effort to start it, she wa always the one that engages first and that is because she is an extrovert and doe this to everyone anyways . Being around her, hearing her voice, seeing her smile felt something, it felt like the flame that I lost year ago came back. But, what made me fell the most is that she is intelligent a well and speaks in English flawlessly I live in a country outside US . I can also relate to her because she suffers from clinical depression and requires therapy session every now and then everyone in training know this anyways because she told the class from the get-go . I did not really asked her out for lunch or coffee, I really wanted to so I could get to know her better and be friend with her, be her guide in her darkest days, but my introversion and over thinking always get the best of me. There were only a few time she joined me and my friend during a coffee break where I found out a few thing about her. There were time that I see the sadness beyond her smile, and time where her depression wa clearly visible and affected me greatly. I always think about scenario - if the condition were right - where I get to talk with her and lend a helping hand, at the end of the day they only remain a thoughts. I know she doe not think about me like how I think about her. Every time our shift ends, I leave the office quickly and ignore the feeling I have for her, my mind is at a constant battle on whether or not to ask her for lunch, ask her if she is ok. It is even worse at night, whenever I see her late night tweet about her depression, a part of me just want to be there for her, and the other part give me the realization of how pathetic I am and that I do not deserve her. I know that she had an ex-bf that broke her heart, and currently ha a gf she is bi . Yet, she still give me inspiration in every photo I take. I really do not know what is wrong with me, I am being tormented by my own mind and I still like it. Knowing that she already ha someone in her heart, yet still seeing her depressed at time and looking at her tweet , really make me want to step up and do something, but held back by my own tormented soul. Next week would be the last week in training, after that we are going to get split up into team and do actual work, but still go back to class to share our experience and reflect upon them. One could only hope for a miracle that I gain the strength and courage to talk to her more and be a part of her life. I really hate this feeling, yet this pain fuel my passion even more.",0.29129

I read a story online about a dog passing away and I thought if little Dixie goes, I will go too. And it took hour before I realized that I do not think I am kidding. I work only so that bill get paid. I will never pay off my student loan debt. If I go soon, my nephew will not have any memory of me. I am cry on my couch. And I do not want to talk to anyone I know personally because they will try to tell me I have reason to be happy, or my fiance will tell me that .. I do not know. I just need to not have an easy out sitting in my closet.",0.14585

"So I finally realized something this week.. Been stuck in an episode since my birthday just turned , a per my last post . Ca not remember the last time I ate a proper meal. Sleep cycle is fucked. Have not left the house in a week. Funny enough, I had planned on hanging out and doing some reading in a cafe today.. only to never leave the house. All this time, I have been thinking how much I yearn to have someone, anyone, physically check in. Or a partner to cuddle with, hug, and hold me tight.. but all that just fade into the empty void. I used to be Christian, and used to pray. Now that I am not, I am realizing how truly alone I am in dealing with all this. My friend all live in the city center. They have job and livelihoods. Ultimately, I have to physically do thing by myself. No one is gonna save me. It is heartbreaking. Physically, I am just so alone.",0.27031
"I am in a reflective mood today. I received a phone call this afternoon from the sister of my old neighbor, who I will call Alice. She had passed away this morning. Alice had been fighting terminal colon cancer since March and after harsh chemo therapy and a bout with pneumonia that landed her in the ICU, she decided that enough wa enough. She stopped treatment just around the July th weekend. I am not too exact on the details, but suffice it to say that she failed quickly after that and passed away in her sleep this morning surrounded by family and friends. She wa only . As I struggle with Depression, AD HD, tic disorders, sleep apnea, insomnia, food allergies, pollen allergies, and a weak immunity system I sometimes feel that life is unfair. I used to say that the Universe wa out to get me, that God is having his little joke with me. I suppose it is only natural to feel that way. It is a full plate and I am not too hungry for what is on the menu. Then I encounter other people with other hardship and I see that life itself is not fair to an awful lot of people. Life is, in fact, a lousy chef. What struck me a sad today, however, wa not simply the passing of somebody I knew. Instead I wa struck with my own mortality and weakness. Let me explain. Alice and some other neighbor had not been too kind to me when I moved into the area. They had accused me of various deviant behavior that to this day still anger me. These were supposed to be my Christian brother and sister and instead they wielded stones. The rumor mounted a the month progressed, wilder and wilder, until they reached a crescendo where they became so outlandish that it wa easy to disprove them. When all the furor amounted to nothing a lot of people were left with egg on their face. That summer several of the family involved moved away. I have unresolved issue with them, but with Alice, my neighbor, I wa able to find forgiveness in my heart. The story did not end happily there with u arm in arm, though. Alice never really apologized to me, though her behavior towards my family and myself became kinder. Unfortunately, she wa one of the people I knew who did not believe in AD HD. One day she told me her opinion on the subject right to my face after I mentioned I had it. I wa so stunned by her bold opinion that I stood there slack jawed. I swore that day I would never let that happen to me again. You see a bit of that fire in this blog whenever anybody accuses me of not having a real problem. I am a fierce in person a well. Thanks to Alice. And now she is passed on. Suddenly my anger feel petty and shallow. She moved away and now ha died, but I allowed her to change me. I nursed a wound like an angry coal in my heart. I forgave her for one thing, but held a grudge for another. She became representative of all the doubter in my life and I used that a impetus for change. What type of person doe that make me? On top of that, I have set lofty goal for myself that are proving hard to meet. Time is ticking and my th birthday is but a scant five month away. One of the byproduct of meeting those goal wa to have a book with my name on it that I could bring into her elementary school classroom one day, slam on her desk, and say Ha! - a if my success would mean anything to her. As if that would prove my struggle with AD HD wa real. How silly. How foolish. Alice wa only thirteen year older than I. I can blink and be tomorrow. Mortality laugh at me and replaces all of life is menu item with sour grape and rotten eggs. What shall I order now? Usually, my sense of humor keep my spirit alight. Today, however, I see myself a being revealed a a small-minded man with insignificant goals. That even for a moment, no matter how miniscule, I wa sad she died before my goal were met.. This both sickens me and splash me in the face with a brisk dose of reality. December loom and I read news? Time leak through my finger and I am worried about a drop in comment on my blog? How did I get so turned around? Where did I get so terribly sidetracked? I need to remember what it is I want out of life. It is not to show up the doubter but to find joy in my own accomplishments. I know that, but negative thought attache itself to our most noble intention like a parasite. Allow it to stay too long and it consumes and replaces what wa once good and uplifting. I do not resent Alice. I never wished her ill. But I regret I let myself hold a grudge, however slight it seemed. Life is too short for such things. So I will allow Alice to change me again. That way when I order from the menu of life it will not be just desserts.",0.0
"Opened up to a friend about my depression. It could have gone better. Hello, Reddit. I have never posted here before. I am a bit nervous about sharing this story I am very shy, even anonymously , so I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read it. I am hoping that just getting it off my chest will help, even if only a little. Also, I am sorry if this post ramble on a bit or is incoherent at all, I am not in the best state of mind at the moment. Earlier today, during our school is lunch break, I opened up to somebody I trusted about my depression and anxiety. I have been on a steep downward spiral recently, and this person had taken notice that something wa wrong. She sat me down, grabbed u a couple of sodas, and told me to spill my guts. Normally, I would have simply told her that everything wa fine, and made some lame excuse like I did not sleep well last night or I am just worried about my exam score . But this wa the first time that anybody had ever reached out to try and help, so I decided to be truthful. I thanked her for offering to listen, and explained that I had never shared this with anybody else, so I might struggle to fully express myself. She wa understanding, and told me to take a much time a I needed. I wa very careful not to unload everything on her, I basically told her exactly what I said at the start of this post that I struggle with depression and anxiety, and that it is been getting a lot worse recently. Initially, it seemed like it wa going well. She had several follow-up questions, some of which I wa not entirely comfortable answering. However, for the first time in year I felt a genuine sense of hope, and felt like someone actually cared about me, so I answered them anyway. Eventually, she asked me what wa causing all of this. I explained that while there are certainly thing that contribute to my depression on a day-to-day basis, at the root of it, there is not really a reason. It is just who I am, almost a if it is hardwired into my brain. It is hard to explain. Do any of you understand what I am talking about? Anyway, this is where thing took a turn. While I wa trying to explain that, she stopped me and said I am sorry, I cannot do this. I offered to help cause I thought you were just having girl problems, or school problems, or something. I did not realize you were totally emo. We are not in high school anymore. Besides, you are a guy, just toughen up . That last part stung. I knew that wa a common sentiment in our society, but to hear it coming from her, someone I have been friend with since high school, really took me by surprise. I did not know what to say, so I did not say anything. I just kind of looked down at my lap. We sat quietly for a moment, until she got up and started gathering her things. As she started to walk away I said I am sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I wa not trying to do that. She looked back at me and said Look, a big reason I am friend with you is because of your positive attitude. It is infectious, and I love that about you. But if that is really just a mask, then you should probably just keep the mask on if we are going to continue being friends. , and then she left. She texted me a few hour later and said I hope you are able to move past your issue so our friendship can move forward . I have not responded, and do not plan to. I cry myself to sleep at night enough a it is without also worrying about maintaining a fake personality for her. I probably will not be opening up to anyone like that again anytime soon except, of course, to all of you wonderful people on the internet . Deep down, I know that most of the people in my life would not react the way she did. But I just do not think I can build up the motivation to try it, not when I struggle just to get up in the morning. I want to thank you all again. Not just for reading my story, but for being a part of this community. Depression and anxiety really suck, and nobody should have to suffer through them alone. ..I am gonna go hug my pillow now.",0.0
"Whenever I try to change my life these thought pop up Had depression and anxiety for year and have many time tried to make change to my life. But I cannot shake the thought that say why bother? . Why suffer through all that extra pain that change requires just for a long shot chance of a normal life? . And on top of that I do not even know if I want a normal life! I Often think that the only thing that separate myself from the normal people in lack of a better word, is that the normal people have an easier time fooling themselves, a bigger capacity for self-delucions. And if happiness can only come from convincing yourself of existential lies, I am not sure if that happiness is for me.. Has anyone else struggled with these thoughts? Does anyone know how to motivate yourself to change when it seems so futile?",0.31538
"When people say dont quit SSRIs, listen to them I wa put on mg Lexapro through my university is health center, but summer rolled around and since I wasnt taking a physical class online one dont qualify you for student insurance apparently I had to pay for coverage in the summer in addition to actually paying for my prescriptions. I thought I wa in a good enough place not financially though, obviously that I didnt even need Lexapro anymore so I started using my remaining bottle and taking smaller dos every day. I went from about mg to mg a day for a week or two and then I ran out. Fast forward to today several week without and I feel like i am having a mental breakdown over every single thing, i am a year old man and have broken down cry multiple time in the past week and have been getting increasingly angry and even violent in some cases. I wa kept waiting too long in a lobby at my apartment for mail and I ended up telling the employee to go fuck themselves and ended up throwing a chair. This is all very interesting considering I got on this and xanax because i couldnt even order food wothout having a nervous breakdown. Another instance is when I stubbed my toe and proceeded to trash my entire fucking apartment and even took a machete to my fridge Dont fucking quit cold turkey.

"Been depressed for so long that i cant remember the last time i wa myself. Hey guy this is my first post here and i dont know where else to go. Ive been in a dark place for a long time but im the kind of person who channel this into humor so not even my family could tell. I just turned yesterday and ive been depressed for about year now. I havent opened up to anyone about it because i keep brushing it aside thinking it would pas but it just keep getting worse. Today i realized something that made me genuinely cry, i seriously didnt remember the last time i wa myself. I used to be super carefree and relaxed, i wa full of energy and would answer any call to chill in seconds. I just asked my close friend when wa the last time he remembers the real me and he said it wa the beginning of college and im currently finishing my second year. Its been getting progressively worse in the last month with a serious drop in my appetite. I also started feeling anxiety for the first time in my life and suicidal thought are uncommon Ive lost about pound in month because of this. My grade also took a hard hit, going from a . gpa every semester to a .. I just had a talk with my mom and she told me that im being ungrateful and that i need to get my shit together ironic considering she suffered depression for year until i pushed her to divorce my father . Im not blaming her at all for my situation because she wa raised by two hardasses so i understand why it hard for her to understand why a teen would be depressed. I know that life is worth it and it get better but i really cant keep the darkness out of my head.

"Why is it so hard to just be empathetic? Today, I failed miserably at baking a key lime pie. Filling wa way too loose, meringue would not whip, crust cracked, just a terrible time overall. And then my mom come over and instead of comforting me or something a normal human being would do, say Better luck next time, with the tone of a carny trying to get a six year old away from his ring toss booth. I got even more upset, and that seemed to genuinely confuse her. All I wanted in that moment wa for her to say I am sorry your pie did not turn out, it will be okay. Or just something a human being with emotion would say to their upset daughter. This even just kind of exemplified what I get sick of in people. Even if you do not get it why is it so hard to realize that people have different priority from you? Especially people who are depressed or have other mental illnesses.

I still care for her a a person and there is nothing bad between u nor do we argue, but it is just not what it wa and I feel like I have needed to move on for the past - months.

"Doctor taking me off med Cold Turkey Hi everyone, I have been on Prozac Fluexetine since th grade. I am a nd year student in college now. For the past few year I have been upped from mg, to mg, and now mg. I have been on mg for years. When I went to my doctor it wa only to tell him during a check up that I wa comfortable with my medicine and dosage, so he would send more prescription to my pharmacy. During my last visit, I expected it to be a quick and simple check up a usual, but instead he said he wa prescribing me more month of mg Prozac then making me stop cold Turkey because being on Prozac for more than month is bad . I do not understand because he ha been constantly renewing my prescription for year and never said anything about tapering off or stopping. I once went a month cold turkey during a health insurance issue and around the rd week I had attempted suicide. And addressing the month he promised, I wa quickly informed the pharmacy wa only given month of medicine for me I have been admitted to a mental hospital by my mother after I got raped and beaten, because I drank a lot of alcohol for a few days. I have been to several therapists. I have been rationing my pill every days, and my mother and fianc e who I live with have already seen a drastic change in my behavior.

My parent said the only reason i did that is because i knew i wa in trouble and just needed an excuse. I do not know why i do not do the thing i know i should be doing. I just feel like i cannot. My parent say it is all my fault, that i do not take responsibility for anything and I just want to blame everything on something else. Which is not the case. They do not think that depression ha anything to do with not trying, that it doe not affect rational decision making. I am starting to think it doe not either. I mean, why cannot i do the thing i know I am suppose to do? The thing that will better my life. The thing that will make my parent proud? Is it the depression or am I truly lazy and just do not care?? Because everything my parent are saying is making me think it really is just me and i do not have depression.",0.19591000000000006

"I am New to this site, I wa diagnosed with SLE Lupus about eight month ago and i am on very strong treatment using predinsone. Everyone around me noticed it first I guess since I wa suddenly so quiet, moody and would cry at the drop of a hat. Which, wa so unlikely of me I used to crack joke laugh and my goal wa always to have fun and make other is laugh. But since my diagnosis and medication which I counted and i am taking like almost pill a week and I just turned yesterday, honestly i would never thought i would be in this state at a few year ago Anyway I never wanted to admit it, depression is not only a symptom of lupus but it is a side effect of the medication a well, and I think that it is a general first reaction to being told that you have an incurable disease. But I finally am starting to see it now I think that i am really depressed. I wa never a quiet girl but now i am so quiet that I think i am scaring everyone. but now i am living with my wonderful boyfriend who seems to understand everything so well and is so patient with me. But I just need a place where I can talk this out with people who understand.",0.29737

I failed though. I am trying to see myself properly, or at least come to the realization that I am not vile and unattractive, and obese. It still end up with food all over the toilet. I disgust myself so much. I disgust myself because I let myself eat. I disgust myself because I think a I do, and I know that eating should be considered normal, but I cannot see it like that. I disgust myself because I covered the toilet bowl in bit of chewed up food and stomach acid. I do not know what to say any more.

I definitely think your right that my anxiety ha sought out a fear that I dread more than any other and it is true that when I am not feeling depressed which incidentally is most of the time. This is only my second spell of depression in year of life I can mull over these thought and not be troubled with them in the slightest. It is really horrible how anxiety can feed off itself and lead you down this path to terrible thoughts. By the way when my partner wa pregnant with our first child she to had dream like yours and she wa upset by them and she like you ha turned out to be an attentive and first class mother.,0.31833

I wa diagnosed several year ago with ocd, which ha a lot to do with it, since I work myself into a frenzy of worry, imaging the worst possible scenario for every situation, and I just shut down and do not want to think about anything, and it is hard to pull myself together and function like a normal human being.

"I have been dealing with severe depression for sometime now, and within recent week it ha hit it worst most of my post were in the MNSEN area lack of sleep, stress, behind on my work, cannot leave my apartment, constant crying, hopeless need, etc. And during these few week I have taken the step into getting into regular therapy again by consulting psych service at my school in conjunction with the counseling I get or hardly ever get from my hospital. The severity of my depression ha been taking a toll on my friend and last night it seemed to reach it pinnacle. I am not sure what came over me, I wa not even drunk, but I started lashing out at a friend of a friend that wa at the same party a I was. I started to verbally bully and attack him because he annoyed me, I do not know why I have so much pent up anger. It rapidly went out of control and before I know it my friend were holding me back and I violently threatened them. For the first time in my life, my best friend closest friend had to physically hold me against a wall, almost hitting me, to get me to come down. I just broke down after that, it wa not even about that stupid guy anymore. I wa suddenly overcome with loneliness and fear an jealousy and embarrassment. I have always been known for a very short temper, and my friend all know me to be very emotional, but I have never gotten so violent I have hit and thrown object before in anger and frustration but I have never struck someone. Though they all tried to console me that night, I feel even farther away from the few friend that I do have. Everything wa hazy from last night, even though I had hardly any to drink.. it wa not so much of an intoxication, but more like a violent breakdown of sorts. I wa so angry and I wa desperate to physically hurt someone it wa quite a scene since I am a petite girl starting a fight with a passive aggressive ft male--some laughed it off at first a a Napoleon Complex, but it became serious when they saw how out of it I was. I just remember being so hurt and angry at my friend I felt so alienated which fueled my anger at the world, at my life more.. As cliche a that sound . And today I just do not feel like going out and I cannot help but feel so alone. The way my friend violently had to restrain me scared me a lot--I have never seen her like that, and she is certainly not the type to behave like that.. I pushed her to that point. It brought me back to an ex-bf of mine that I wa very close too and who saw the worst of my depression a well he too at one point had to restrain me violently against his character a well . After an off and on relationship of trying to stay together, he could not take me, or my emotional instability, anymore. Last night, I had friend breaking down screaming at me that they were never enough for me to make me happy or content otherwise and it just brought me back to that moment with my ex. I feel a if that this cycle is in all my relationships--romantic one and friendships. I seem to constantly push people away. I do not know what to do. I do not miss my ex-bf at all, but I am scared that I will never be able to have close relationship friendships. Everyone I know just pity me.

"Am I Depressed? While I have been distraught and suicidal on and off since age fifteen, I have never been formally diagnosed with anything because I do not trust the mental-health establishment. I have only visited a shrink twice once when forced by parents, a second time when pressured by a partner. Because of this, I am reluctant to claim I am depressed except in the loose, colloquial sense. Instead, I feel my rage and despair flow quite appropriately from my failure to fulfill my desires, achieve my dreams, and so on. I hate being alive and would adore a sudden death, sure, but that doe not necessarily mean I am depressed, right? I do not experience many of the symptom of formal depression I sleep pretty well most of the time, I eat okay, and I am socially active. I feel abjectly isolated, but empirically I spend a fair amount of time with friendly acquaintance at event and so on. I resist the medical model of my mental state because it assumes the problem is with me rather than with the world. I figure I would be okay if I had the basic level of social success normal folk have a number of close friend and a healthy romantic sexual relationship with one or more partners. I am becoming increasingly confident my genetics and value combine to make forming meaningful connection with other human effectively impossible. Because I yearn for such connection intensely, it is only rational that this dynamic would make my life unlivable. I am not depressed. My brain ai not malfunctioning it is a valid a pattern a any.

"How can I get my finance back to a point where I can go to school or to a point where I do not hate my life? I guess some backstory. I am about to be in September. When I wa in spring of th grade my mom got sick Lupus or something, honestly she might be faking it but that is a whole different post. Anyway she went to the hospital and wa there for about a month. I ended up skipping a lot of school to be able to care for and do all the general house duty for my younger brothers. yr old and yr old at the time. . Things progress my mom miss a lot of work we end up moving with my grandma. Now here is where shit really hit the fan. So tension build between my grandma and my mom because of my mom suspected prescription opiate and Benzo abuse. Anyhow, dfchs get involved not related to the drug but that did not help about month before I go to college and my mom health deteriorates seemingly out of nowhere. So freshman and sophomore year I am juggling trying to work to support myself, school, and helping my grandma take care of my brothers. I thought I could handle it, I could not. Of course my schoolwork suffered and my gpa dropped below Hope eligibility. So I tried to find a full time job, and I did. Then got laid off not too soon after due to budget cuts. My first time experiencing adulthood. Shortly after my car died and my depression got to a dark place. What followed is month of applying to anything I could reasonably walk to I wa trying to search within mile because transportation in the part of Georgia I wa in wa a huge deal and I could not get around. No job responded. Including the Walmart a mile away with a fucking hiring sign out front that I repeatedly went in to try and talk and build rapport with the managers. During these month I took out credit card and ended up maxing them out. I needed food and other essential that I simply had no money for. The depression kinda spiraled out of control. I had a plan in place to hang myself but my friend at the time took the rope I wa going to use and I wa too broke to buy another. My dad who ha been in and out of my life. Mostly out prior to this. Invited me out to come stay with him and his family in LA while I tried to get myself together. I am working hard, I found a job here. Retail but it is a job. I am waking up early, I am doing noFap and I am working out x a week to try to keep my depression in check. But despite all that, I want to kill die still. I do not see a future where I am able to continue school. Dfchs told me they could not help pay for college because I wa not in for long enough before beginning college but they had no fucking problem coming to my dorm and asking me question and causing stress once a week. I feel like I am barely supporting myself, and honestly I have not talked to my brother since the youngest one birthday April th . Because I feel like I failed them. I have not talked to my grandma either because I feel like a disappointment. And my mom keep calling me every other month telling me she is gonna kill herself because she feel like nobody love her. Even through I bent over fucking backwards trying to help her by bringing my brother to see her and making sure they could talk. My grandma and the rest of my mom family will not talk to her because she is cursed all of them out horribly when they tried to be there for her",0.2713

Let is get out of chronological order. Due to weird circumstances, I went for about month without medicines, and therapy. In November, I wa at the bottom of a deep, dark pit, so called my psychiatrist, Barry. Surprising for me, I went back with a new, improved attitude. We would had a couple of productive session when annual review came out. I called him for advice, and thought that while the advice he offered wa good, that he wa not being supportive at all. I actually thought about how to discus with him how his response made me feel, rather than just shut him out. We had a couple of excellent sessions, which apparently told him that something had triggered defensive coping skills, and where my mind actually was.

"Everything ha changed.. About four year ago I wa the typical loner. I wa in the middle school. Nobody took me seriously, because my hobby were not shared by anyone else. I am from a small town, so it wa difficult for me to find someone who actually liked the thing I did. At the time I liked thing like anime, video game and MLP. I am a year old lass now and I only like video game now. In the final grade of my middle school I met a girl. She wa about two year younger but liked the same thing I did. I wa so happy to finally meet someone like me. We have bonded a lot and she wa the first person I truly loved, except for my family, of course. About two year ago we started to get distant. She kept talking to me about thing I wa uncomfortable with, but whenever I tried to talk about something that bothered me, she told me she wa busy and did not hear me out. It escalated in June of . I started talking to her friends, because they seemed like such wonderful people to me. Then we met up, all of us. She kept cry and making scenes. Few week before that, she accused me of liking HER friend more than I liked her. But when we all met, it seemed alright, save for her cry etc.. When I got home the next day, she told me off. Really badly. She told me to go to hell, called me all sort of name and I feared.. I feared I would never be able to find someone like her again. I tried to end it. Swallowed sleeping pill and drank alcohol. I woke up the next day in a hospital. I woke up to a text from her. One that said she wish my mother wa torn apart by the girl is dogs.. It is been two years. I have gotten better, met friend that helped me out a lot and I will probably never be able to repay it. But this past of mine, it still haunt me.

"I am new to these board and I hope I am posting in the right spot..I have been diagnosed with major recurring depression since . I have a host of chronic, painful auto-immune related diseases. I am also trying to care for an ill family member who just got out of the hospital and had major surgery take a year to recover from this surgery . This family member is pretty much bedridden and need to be bathed, fed, and cared for much the way a private duty nurse would. It is a daunting task for me under the circumstances. Insurance will not pay for long term care and we cannot afford even the cheapest of help. Hence, I am managing all of it alone. Once in a blue moon, my in-law will help but are very resentful on the rare occasion that I ask for help. My house is cluttered I saw that topic and I am not sure if it because I am so depressed or because I have been sick too much to take care of it. I think perhaps it both. I know that at least some of my depression is situational, but I also know that some of it is not. I am on medication, but the medicine have never done a whole lot for me. I have tried them all. I wa found to be resistant to medication. Whatever that means. I wa hospitalized for a month period in the is for suicide attempts. I guess what brought me here is that I feel like I am about to crack and am trying to find a way to avoid that. I am hoping to get past this pain caused by this disease I have so that I can get the energy back that I need to unclutter my house, have a genuine smile on my face when handling my nursing duty and get a hold on my life in general.",0.32261999999999996

"Having a really bad stretch of days.. Hi all, I know this sub move kinda fast but I just wanted to vent, hopefully some of you read this.. So my story is that I have had depression and social anxiety for about year or so at least that is when I recall starting to feel off .. I am now .. Because of my poor decision to bottle thing up and accept that I am unhappy I put off seeking help until about a month or two ago in which I started going to therapy. It had taken a rather bad mental fallout that occurred in early December for me to finally reach out for help. In my session we have been working on technique to combat both my SA and depression, these include going to place alone such a coffee shops, yoga classes, shopping malls, etc. Keep in mind I have functioning social anxiety where I can physically be around people but I am extremely uncomfortable the entire time and have a very difficult time interacting with people .. The thought process being that my depression stem from loneliness and my SA contributes to that.. It is been a big step for me to try and go out on my own, but I have been doing it almost every day even though it doe not seem to be creating any improvement. Unfortunately the last few day have been incredibly difficult, I am getting a very sick feeling of hopelessness and worry that my life is now just constantly shuffling around desperately trying to find something in the world that will fix me. I tried to sit at home last night to give myself a break and I could not even do that, I started becoming consumed by those bad thought and began having a panic attack.. So I decided to just go drive aimlessly even though we were in the middle of a snow storm.. I feel miserable again today and I am just running out of steam to keep going, I really do not know what to do anymore.. I am exhausted from constantly forcing myself into uncomfortable public situation but at the same time my home feel like a prison.. I have nobody to talk to or gain support from anymore, the couple of friend that I have all have their own life with wife and kid and my family ha been out of my life for year and for good reason..

"My First Real Episode Hey guys..

So to start everything off, I never thought that I would be typing these word a I am now. Not to say that I am ashamed of it, but just because I never felt I had anyone to share with. I never have felt like I wa able to confide in my close friend or family because I do not want them to carry the burden of my troubles, and I used to feel like it would just be a form of attention seeking to try and explain to others how I feel sometimes. With that being said, I feel a if I truly hit my lowest of low about an hour ago and the sad thing is that I cannot really describe the feeling.. because all it felt like wa just a severe sense of nothingness. I felt a if I wa experiencing an out of body sensation, and my mind could not calculate any sense of emotion besides this feeling of dread that wa accompanied by a warmth-like feeling starting from the back of my brain and slowly taking over my head. It is been happening a lot lately during the night.. especially since I have been moderately sick lately and it feel like my body is giving up on me no matter what I try.. eating healthy and exercising only take away the feeling of loneliness and sickness a little bit. What really help is interaction with others, whether it be watching live program or being on xbox talking to people or being in chat room because it give me a small sense of community and belonging that I lose when my mind is left alone to itself.

How many more expansion of diagnosis in the dsm? doe it have to be to wake you sheeples up that Collectivising human behaviour and giving them a label of disease with symtomps doe it have to be to tell you that these behaviour are not found through cellular pathology, brain scans, blood tests, or some medical diagnostic criteria? How many more deaths, school shootings, senseless violence, suicide by the administration of drugs? Will it have to be to wake you people up that psychiatry ha killed more people throughout the entire history of the world than the Jewish halocaust?

Recently, I wa attempting to get into a ketamine study in a NYC hospital and wa asked a number of question about my background. One item which came up that I have not thought about in a while wa the specific of my uncle suicide when I wa around . My uncle wa a yr old gay M, developed HIV and killed himself. Though this is not what I wa initially told. It took around year with every year or so getting a new piece of information. Initially I wa told he had cancer and died. Then I wa told he had cancer and my grandparent pulled the plug . Then I wa told he wa gay, had cancer, and my grandparent pulled the plug . Then I wa told he wa gay, had HIV, and my grandparent pulled the plug . Then, finally, I wa told he wa gay, had HIV and killed himself. I think I secretly had an understanding of how he had killed himself even when I wa a kid and wa not told due to subtle hint that kid will typically pick up on. Even if I did not, I always had the feeling that something wa wrong and that my parent were not truthful. After discussing his death for two hour for the study, I realized that the depression I have been feeling for over year is so similar to the feeling I get when I think of my uncle. Intense grief. I delved into the feeling more and have not been able to stop cry for the past few day about my uncle. Does this make sense from a psychological stand point to be greiving for this long? I know there is no time limit on emotion but doe it make sense for my depression to be a a result of shoving down his death and holding onto it for all this time?

"I made it so much worse Hey guys, have not been on reddit long, or this subreddit either. Never intended to post something, but recent event have changed that. So, I will start with some background, I am a year old high school student. My best friend is too, Who will be referred to a Golf from now on We did not even know each other before the school year started, but we had a couple mutual friend and we just.. connected. It is one of those friendship where it doe not really make sense, to anyone, let alone either of us, it is like we are family. It is the only way I can describe it. Anyway, we are dipshit high schoolers, so we joke about depression and suicide in our friend group. The group know Golf ha depression, they have no clue about mine though. Anyway, when I started hanging out with him I did what I have been doing for a year and a half. Joking about my depression and making joke about offing myself. I did not know Golf had it until a couple month ago, but soon after we started hanging out he started joking about it too. Well he got reported to the counseling center, a couple of time in fact. But they are honestly useless, so it did not help. It came to a head last night when the group basically kidnapped him and forced him to go to a hospital. They did not tell me for whatever reason. I still have not figured out why. But eventually I got there. The night is a blur from there, I did not eat anything since breakfast, and that wa noodles. As I am just now typing this I realize that I am at around hour without food now. But that is not important. I did my best to be there for Golf. He went home safe with his parent and is going to go to therapy counseling. It wa an awful day yesterday, a couple of event made Golf is depression way worse for him. I am glad we got him to the hospital before he hurt himself. But it is my fault, I know it is. I do not need you guy telling me how it is not either. You wont change my mind. It is my fault, I taught him that suicide and depression could be treated a a joke. I made it worse. I hate myself for it. I do not know what to do. Hell, I do not know why I made this post at all. I do not know if I want advice, or vent, or see if there is someone else out there who ha gone through something like this. Right now he is on a trip with his mom and dad golfing. Golf the activity is one of the few thing he enjoys. All I want to do is lay in my bed and not exist in the outside world for the rest of spring break. I do not want to take any attention away from Golf. He deserves it more than I do. I just do not know what to do anymore.

I am talking booze and watching horrible telivision from the is And it dawn on me that I will get another chance. I may have fucked thing up this time but I have bounced back from fuckup before by just acting natural so I am probably going to do so again. There will be more chance to treat people the way I want to be treated no matter what age I get to.

Combination of family issues, breakup, and final put me in a really depressive state. As a result, I would been having strong suicidal thought for weeks. I had been seriously thinking about ending my own life. So that is the context in which this occurs. About a month ago I signed up for secret santa on a whim. I had never done it before and honestly did not expect anything. But yesterday, my gift arrived. I do not know who this person is, but they spent at least dollar on about separate gifts. They also included a really thoughtful and touching letter that talked about how they thought I wa such a great person and how much they enjoyed learning about me. I immediately broke down cry upon reading it. It might seem small or sorta stupid, but it made me feel like someone cared about me. That I wa not the idiotic nobody my depression tell me I am all of the time. I felt motivated and happy for the first time in weeks. I cleaned my room and did work that I would been ignoring for months. I finally felt like maybe, just maybe, I meant something. It changed my life, and probably saved it. So whoever you are, thank you so much, and I cannot express how much this meant to me or thank you enough. And let this be a lesson to everyone else. The smallest act can and doe make a difference.

I have been depressed on and off for the past year with serious suicidal thought for the last . I really think that it is time that I start anti depressant because I reckon it would help me tons. The problem is, I do not want my mum to know because the last time I opened up about being slightly suicidal and very depressed, she freaked out on me do not need to get into details. She ha had a history with it herself and I know that if i ever took my life, it would permanently ruin her. At this point, medication is my last resort. I have had a girlfriend and it made no difference whatsoever, I still feel empty most of the time and would rather die than anything else. I know that in Singapore you are able to consent medically when you are , but I am not sure if i can possible get around her for med like this without her knowledge consent. Any help for my situation would be fantastic Thanks everyone",0.31783
"Desperately want to WANT TO get better Attempted suicide May st, wasted a week of my life in voluntary inpatient, wa put on the one drug that ha ever helped me olanzapine, an antipsychotic which I then promptly had an allergic reaction to, got off of, and crashed again.

I know it is not healthy to live for another person but I am not exactly in a position to nitpick. At this point all I can do for them is try to be a reliable a possible while also isolating myself more often than not so that they do not have to deal with a constantly suicidal person more frequently than they can handle.

"The toughest pill to swallow is that I care about the girl most I have lost all motivation for my academic life, have basically no ambition left and have just been floating around doing nothing the past few years. My parent trusted me and are probably disgusted by me right now. I have lost all my Bitcoin in a fire. I wa one of the early pioneer and had literally a couple hundred thousand dollar worth not too long ago. I will admit this one wa getting to me quite a bit. Especially since I could have prevented it. But you know what really incited and is still by far the biggest part of my depression? A girl. A stupid, uninteresting, normal as girl. But I love her. I love being around her. And she probably doe not even give a shit about me because she ha a boyfriend. We hung out at a park and had a great time, we always do when we talk.. But she is never the one to start a conversation and never offer to hang out. Okay, boyfriend, but at least let me be your friend. Just planning a meetup is such a pain the ass. I wish you would just tell me to fuck off, but you keep saying yes. All while you straight up do not give a shit about me. Hope is the worst part. I am still clinging to my failing studies, new random as coin and this fucking girl. I cannot even concentrate on the other two because I think of her all the time. I am desperately trying to stay relevant to her in hope I can catch her when she is available again and I feel like such a fucking creepy loser. All for that small chance.",0.33333

Hello everyone, I have, like many, lost interest in pretty much everything, I only do one thing, from time to times, and I would not consider it a passion or a hobby . I need to stop focusing on some thing in life, and reconsider who I am, and to do this I need to find some hobby and start making friend again, or at least start to enjoy myself. But how?

"I think I ruined another friendship TLR Made a wonderful friend, had a depressive episode, and ruined the friendship by trying to force my problem on her. Just like I have done a million time before. I have had depression my whole life and I have always gone through episodes. Sometimes they are mild, and I am just generally down for a few days, sometimes they debilitating and I can barely get out of bed for weeks. I have also never had a lot of friends. I do not have casual relationships. I either do not really think of you a friend, or I love you with every part of my heart. There is no middle ground. I have been building a friendship with a great girl from work call her Amy for a few months. It doe not seem like anything romantic is gonna come from it, but it wa nice to have a friend I could do stuff with. We went hiking, rock climbing, we even went on a scuba trip to the Caribbean together. I would opened up to her about my depression and she seemed really understanding. She actually seemed to appreciate how open and communicative I wa about it. The day before the Super Bowl, I felt an episode coming on. It wa not severe, but it made me fragile. I am a big Patriots fan, so when the Pats lost, it set me up for a bad episode. If I would just been sad about the Patriots Monday and let myself heal like I usually do when my team lose, everything would have been fine, but instead I started to blow my friendship. I texted Amy Tuesday that I wa feeling down and I would like to see her. I made a big deal about how I wa not cry about the Pats, but I wa having an episode. It seemed important to me to point that out for some reason. She said someone wa visiting from our India office and had a ton of work for her, but she would try to come over after. She worked until that night and never made it. Wednesday I left work at am because I wa too down to stay. I wa texting her the same stuff throughout the day, how I wa sad and I wanted to see her. She worked until again and did not come, but this time she had never promised to. I texted her this big apology about how I have been a shitty friend and I am sorry for forcing my problem on her. At work Thursday she told me to stop apologizing for everything. I told her I would try to stop. Friday just felt different. She wa le talkative with me than usual. She brought me cooky she made, and I thought that might be a sign that thing were getting better, but after work I asked her if she had plan that weekend, and her answer wa simply yes . I said have fun and left. Normally she would have at least told me she a general idea of what she wa doing. I talked to my roommate best friend Samantha about it Friday night. We agreed I needed to just leave Amy alone for the weekend, so I texted her and said if she found any free time I would love to see her and then I did not contact her again until yesterday at work. Yesterday some thing happened that really made me feel like thing were ending. First, we had talked about planning a trip President is day weekend, but she had a surgery and she did not want to plan anything until it wa done that is a whole other thing that is bothering me . When I asked her yesterday, she said she thought President is day wa in March and she promised to see her brother this weekend, so we will see . She also told me she like working late and going to the gym at like . Apparently she is been working hour day for the past week. The gym part hurt because one of my favorite thing to do with her wa work out, and now I have lost my gym buddy. I have had a lot of friendship go this way in the past. Speaking a little immodestly here, but when I am not depressed, I am funny, energetic, and interesting, and generally a fun person to be around. I have had lot of people enter my life, meet that me, like him, then after a few month meet the depressed side of me and just nope the fuck out. Amy first met the depressed me a few month ago and she did not run away. I thought she could be a big part of my support network moving forward. But I am worried that I just tried to put too much on her. Like I have done a million time before. The worst part is she sits right next to me at work. She is leaving next month to hike the Appalachian Trail, but until then, if I really did blow this, then I have to sit next to her every day for a month. I do not know if I can handle that. Anyway, thanks for listening to me whine about my problems.",0.25795
"Reluctant to get diagnosed I am reluctant to go to the doctor and find out if I have depression. I cannot exactly explain this, but it is a combination of a few things.

"seeing other people having close, intimate relationship with each other made me so goddamn sad that I had to leave. I wa at a party last night with some friends, and the whole time I saw people talking and hanging out like they were best friend and had known each other for years. It made me really sad because even though I have a wide circle of acquaintances, my mental illness and my fear of rejection make it so hard to actually get close to people. I have been in college for a year and a half and I still do not have any close friend that I text or hang out with. My friend from high school are all off at different college living their own life now, so we are not close anymore. I kept thinking about this last night at the party and I got so sad that I left. I can only really think of one close friend that I have, and even then we do not really hang out that often. I do not really have anyone in my life.",0.33179000000000003

"Hi there. My name is Tim, I am year old and live in the UK. I have been prescribed mg of paroxetine, but stopped taking it a couple of month ago a it wa not helping me in my situation, which ha probably made me physically worse. My depression probably stem from low self esteem and the feeling of general failure. I have suffered for year now, not constantly, a success at work can suppress it i.e. time when I feel I am contributing something . To the outside world I probably appear relatively normal I have to stop now a I need to go out, I will try and articulate where I am coming from later",0.49818
"Here is my story, however dull and blunt it may be .. High school wa great. Lots of fun You know- Parties, beer, dates, sport and the works. I wa never what one would call popular, however, I wa respected by nearly everyone I went to school with. This, I feel wa an asset of mine and helped me with self confidence a well a developing a a individual. I am now in June and have no job, no money, do not go to school and have LITERALLY no friends, aside from my parent whom I still live with a leach off of what a joke . I am virtually reclusive in my home with the occasional outing to buy cigarette and to visit my Grandmother who is well near her deathbed. I suppose my past bout with drug may be a co - culprit influencing me to work in close to complete isolation. Maybe there is a cure for me but, chance are it is not natural remedy. My addictive personality and past drug experience ha veered me away from trying the latest depression medication or any for that matter. This condition of mine, whatever the fuck it is, started developing slowly. I would avoid large social gathering at first, then I would pretty much steer clear of meeting with friend even the closest of friend , and finally I would not even take phone calls. At this point it is all of the above. When I do confront a person, which by all mean I try to avoid, I cannot for the life of me keep eye contact like I used to and I seem like a complete, uninterested asshole who is simply in a rush and ha no time for chat. For instance, a two old friend of mine from high school stopped by at my house today to catch up on things. When asked what I wa up to I looked at the ground and replied, Well .. I am pathetic excuse of a lie go here .. Nobody buy my shit. If I do not believe myself how can anyone else.? So, here I am today. The table ha turned. I am now the chump. The one without any respect OR self respect and the guy who respect anyone who is not a lowly a myself. And I hate myself for it. It is not a if I had a rough upbringing. My parent are and were loving, I have had so many friends, all the opportunity in the world. And I waste it all and continue to do so every stinking day of my life. I am not looking for sympathy. It actually matter little if nobody read this at all. I just needed to put my thought somewhere I could come back to re - read and contemplate them",0.22538000000000002

"Drank too much and ended up in the hospital Let me start this off by saying I am underage, so that just make this just so much better. Anyway, a handful of month back I had the smart idea to get drunk by myself. I do not know what did it, I only drank a few shots, le than what I normally do, but whatever I guess it wa destined. Next thing I know, I am waking up all wrapped up in IVs with my mom next to me. I am confused a all living hell. My mom just say you drank the vodka, looking more devastated than I have ever seen her, and then I cry myself to sleep. Now I am ruined. I am broken. The guilt eats away at me all the time, constantly. As soon a I think of my family that is all I can think of. Apparently I wa found in a aggravated state, and upon being discovered I punched two hole in the wall, along with attempting to put in a hole in my father is head. God I fucking hate myself. I am not even a violent person, I hate hurting anything. Being anywhere around my home or family just make me unbearably sad now. I had to come home and look my brother in the eye, and apologize for being so fucked up I tried to not only punch my dad, but a police officer who wa forced to restrain me. By the way I do not remember any of this, all of this my parent told me. You know how much that hurts? Not remembering a night at all, and it turn out you ran at your dad screaming, fuck you I am gonna kill you I hate myself. I am so full of regret and guilt and self hatred all the time. I hurt my family so much, and I continue to. I have had multiple emotional breakdown since, when pretending to be okay just becomes too much. I have made my parent so concerned for me. Not only do they constantly think I am high now, and do not hesitate to think every single fucking broken thing is my fault because I got too fucked up , but with the emotional rant I have had I am sure they think im about to blow any second and kill myself. I ruined everything. My relationship with my family is ruined. I love my parent beyond belief, and I know they love me too, but the shame, and the sadness I feel just being around them, it is constantly unbearable. Nothing feel normal anymore. It ha not since that fucking day. I would give anything, literally anything to go back. I would rather be completely paralyzed than do what I did to my family. I have no care for myself at all anymore. I hate myself more than any other person. I am selfish, impulsive, lazy, stupid, and above all le than worthless. If I wa not born I am sure my family would be much more happy. I cannot kill myself, because then I would kill my whole family. My mom straight up told me if I kill myself that will be the end for her too. I do not know what to do then. I guess slowly shrivel away or hope I get ran over.",0.35769
"I am trying to get communication back with my best friend. I have an idea, it will not be easy and it may never work, but it is worth a shot? Long story short I have been depressed and I have a friend. I could make a paragraph story about my friend and my depression. But I want to get to the point. I do not want to make this post too long otherwise no one will read it. My friend made the decision to stop communication with me until I go to a residential psychiatric program or somewhere similar. The thing is I have been in one already, it wa a pretty flexible place, cell phone were allowed, door were never locked, etc. Long story short I became too high risk and am not allowed back. And I do not want to go back. I do not believe in happiness by mental health, I believe in natural happiness. I believe that all human deserve to feel happy without being told your life suck so you need pill and mental health treatment to be happy. So anyways, I cannot fulfill his wish. But getting communication back with him is all I want. There are no exceptions. So here is my idea. Just for fun I livestream game on YouTube. I do it for fun, not for fame, I do not play those popular games, I play the one that no one plays. It is unlikely for a video to get more than views. But I have considered starting a new channel. I will livestream games, post video about my custom Guitar Hero song I do that for fun too and just pretty much show that I am having fun. But the big goal of the channel will be to get my friend back . That will be the whole idea. That will be written on every video. That is what the channel art will say. Think of it a a gofundme, only I am not asking for money, I am asking for support from the public to hear my story, hear what I am doing, and to be there with me when my friend doe deliver. Here is the catch. For obvious reasons, his name will never be revealed. No one will have any idea who my friend is. But little by little, I will try to reveal the channel to him. It will start with the channel being named Ian , then sooner or later add my last name. As time go on I will try and find way to give him clue about the channel without actually telling him anything. The big dream is that he eventually discovers the channel, and with whatever support there is, he will see how much I have mentally improved over however long it takes. This all may sound totally silly, totally bogus, yeah, maybe this will never work in a million years. Just a wild thought that I am going to attempt anyways. I might edit this post with a link to the channel depending on the response here.",0.22875

"A letter to a person I let down To The Person I Miss The Most, Happy birthday man, I miss you and I am sorry. It feel like so much time ha gone by that any attempt at reconciliation would do more harm than anything else at this point. We used to have so much fun, but nostalgia only make everyone feel worse, and more often than not lead to poor choices. It is a sweet substance, like sugar, just with a punch in the gut to remind you that you cannot ever go back to something you once valued so highly. It is been a year and a couple month since we have talked, and there is rarely a day where you do not cross my mind. I am not saying that is healthy, because it sure a hell is not, but who care anyways. I wa not good for you, you were too good for me, we crashed and burned and I loved every second of it. Was it worth it? Maybe. Does that matter? Not in the slightest. Now I just sit alone in the dark writing you letter that I know you will never fuckin read, pretending in my head that there is some fucking way that i can salvage the situation. It is like watching someone stand at the bottom of the pool drowning, when all they have to do is swim to the surface. I am cold, and tired, wasting time and throwing away opportunity left and right because i have no idea what I am doing, and I know that you are doing well, that make me happy. You deserve to succeed. You have been to hell and back, and I might a well have been the chauffeur for a good portion of it. I loved you, I do not think I do anymore, but I know I did. I thought about comparing how I felt about you with a bunch of shitty metaphor but let is be honest, that is not our style. We would probably laugh at how cheesy it wa and how stupid this whole situation is and then we would pull out our guitar and write a beautiful sad duet and I would be out of tune while you hit every note perfectly. But you would not critique me, that is just the way you are. Too kind, and sweet, too good to everyone you came across even though you knew there wa a pretty good chance that they would never return the favor. And man I really tried to, all those time we walked around talking about how much we wanted to die and how sad we were, but the whole thing wa build on the back of our own loneliness and sadness. But that is the past. Nostalgia is bullshit, but I have to indulge once in awhile just to feel something, I am sure you remember that. Here is to better time ahead, and a letter left unread.

"I did not expect there are people here so quick to judge and assume I made a post about how hard it is to date and find someone if you have depression. I mentioned how people with depression who have a significant other most likely have an easier time that those who do not. What I did not imply wa that I wanted that just for the sake of curing my depression. And that is what another member tried to pin on me. He or she quickly went into offensive and started preaching about how selfish it is to want to be in a relationship if you are depressed, how I should go seek therapy and that I should realize that relationship are not a magic cure. I do not want to be in a relationship for it to fix my depression, I am going to therapy, taking antidepressant for year now and I am fully aware being with someone is not a cure I wa with someone while depressed for year .

However, I am too afraid to drop out because that lifestyle seems even more daunting. I really want to go someplace where I can live out my life in seclusion and just get away from anything.

"I am new here today. I believe I have been suffering from depression since I wa a late teen. I am now , run my own business and just started Prozac late December seeing a psychologist in late Nov. I do not feel any better but it is a relief just knowing that you are doing something other than trying to ignore a definite but unexplainable problem. I suffer from severe anxiety, fall asleep fine but wake up at . am with my mind racing a million mile a minute, mostly about work. This anxiety and depression ha definitely affected my relationship with my wife kids. Most time when you are at work you want to be home vice versa, really do not know what you want. I do not feel like talking to anyone have cut off most of my good friends. I understand most men do not want to admit they have a problem until their wife leaf them and it is too late. I am happy that is not the case with me. I just hope the medication kick in soon so I can see what it feel like to be normal if that is possible. Thanks for letting me ramble",0.20042

"My weight is ballooning out of control. I take daily MG of Prozac in the morning MG Klonopin same time MG Klonopin PM MG Klonopin bedtime , prescribed by a psychiatrist. I also take MG Keppra at bedtime for migraine prevention prescribed by a neurologist . I have been on various combination of these for a couple of years. The psychiatrist is doggedly insistent that the medication I am on should not be making me gain weight - but nonetheless they are. I have had other medication that have given me side effect that I should not have had - but nonetheless I do. I have read many, many story on the internet and through direct conversation with others that say they have had exactly the same thing happen with SSRI is. When I have asked him to change the medication, he keep preaching diet and exercise . It ha not worked. I am now down to the point where I eat virtually nothing and today I exercised to the point where I nearly blacked out. This is causing problem between my wife and I she also see the same psychiatrist and take Klonopin and Effexor , not least because I have no sexual desire. None. She see him the psychiatrist tomorrow but I do not see him until April . Yesterday in my therapy session I had an angry outburst that maybe I should just quit taking all the medication because maybe I am over medicated and she did not like that too much. Am I going to have to die of obesity or over exercise to get his attention? What do I have to do to convince them? This is not helping my depression any when I cannot stand to even look at myself in the mirror.",0.52667

"Nightmares and dream HI, I do not know about you, but when I wa a kid I used to have this weird nightmare not the teeth fell out usual nightmare Like getting lost in a winter forest in pijamas just to be eaten up by wolves, being totally awake at my bed while insect ate me alive like sleep paralysis but dreaming? or just watching my mother being eaten by feral dog a she protected me. Anyway, a I grew older and my depression grew with me, I stopped having nightmares, I can barely recall when the last one was. Instead I have pretty vivid dream not lucid one and in most of them, I am at some kind of weird scenery where I feel like I have always been there, and weird shit happens that I can remember, and it is like a full story, a lot of different thing happen in the same dream. The problem is, in most of them, I meet someone, normally a girl, with which I start a mutual relationship after overcoming some hardship, like, my biggest desire. These dreams, a good a they sound, are worst than the nightmare because when I wake up, it take some time to realize that I did not live that shit, that I am still in bed, and I am still alone.",0.36809000000000003

You can cry, and scream all you want but at the end of the day, no one is gonna be able to understand you, and the deep well that ha been buried within your mind. So what if you grew up rejected by every girl, guy, and person? So what if you have just turned and endured wave upon wave of mental abuse? At the end of the day, when you are laying in your bed, and your demon are starting to swallow you whole and fill up the bowl, what do you do? You face it. You indulge yourself in them until the pain is numb, and you cannot feel anything anymore. It may not be healthy, but it is better than suffering.

"Poor Spring. He try so hard but sometimes thing do not work despite best laid plans. His ex wife is doing isomething almost every weekend in August and September. So his plan to take me away have dissolved. Thing is.. I kind of think it is a tad bit of not wanting to see him happy. Ex is are so hard to deal with. Look at me and Cretin. He still continues to make our life a misery on every given occasion. Wait until he find out I have a boyfriend. It will be question a to who he is, his family heritage and down to whether we have depraved sexual practice in front of the girls. I also really detest his girlfriend.. Mainly because of the time she is upset the kids. It is not the kid fault. I feel like Small Spring is caught in the middle a little bit and will not have him made to feel bad in any way. So we are not going away in the way we would planned.. We are trying to snatch a night in July maybe? We will see, no pressure. It is meant to be fun not a trial. There is always the turkey and tinsel fun weekend at Christmas. I can wear tinsel in strategic place and feel MUCH more relaxed I feel good tonight. I like being able to take control and understand stuff. Rise above the crap. Oh cat worries.. Taylor ha a limp. He is ALWAYS got something going on.

"Writing out my feeling in hope of gaining some sense of catharsis I would like to start by saying I do not think I am a danger to myself. I am tethered here pretty strongly by my family and my best friend. I cannot see myself leaving them, because I have seen what it doe to people when those closest to them go. I resent the fact that I cannot go, at times, but there is nothing to be done about it really. Most of the people in my life only ever knew my outer shell. The somewhat false personality that I put on in order to function. Over the last three year my mask ha been crumbling away and the result have not been pretty. It is been a viscous feedback loop that leaf me feeling worse and worse a people fall out of my life one by one, either by their own choosing or because I distance myself to hide my pain a I become le and le able to handle it. The summer after my sophomore year I wa in the darkest place of my life. I had to pull out of university and move home to get therapy. It wa actually very effective, and my junior year wa a home run. I wa getting the highest test score in STEM class with students, I wa killing it in my philanthropic efforts, and I had more friend and social obligation than I knew what to do with. My senior year I spent the fall studying abroad in France. It wa magical. I fell in love for the first time. I wa not reciprocated, but the thing I learned about love is that it doe not have to be reciprocated to be the most beautiful thing you have ever felt. When I got back from France, the seed of my current ruin were planted. All throughout college I would been heavily involved with a camp for kid whose parent have cancer. I did it because my dad had cancer when I wa a little kid, and the people I met were all wonderful, but most of all because the only thing that give me a sense of purpose is helping other people. It drive almost everything I do. This camp gave me a rock that I could cling to through the worst of my emotional storms. The two director of the camp were both new my senior year. While I wa in France, one of them dropped out of school due to her own struggle with mental health. The director that wa left over wa completely overwhelmed, and entirely ineffectual. People left and right were telling me that I should take the open position. I did not want it I have ADHD a well a depression and I wa so anxious about my lack of organization. Camp wa in such a hole though, and for the sake of my friend and my camper and their family I did the only thing I felt like I could do, and took on the directorship. It wa rough. My co-director continued to do little of anything, and I felt like I wa juggling grenades. I could not fuck this up. Kids I would been mentoring for year needed this camp to cope in a healthy way, and for a number of parent couples, the week of camp wa the last time they got to spend alone together before one of them would pas away from cancer. My grade dropped a whole point, on average. My volunteer research suffered, and I really let down the post doc I wa assisting Sorry Bethany . My mental health took a nosedive a well. I made camp happen. It wa ugly and bumpy and unorganized, but I made it happen. I took solace in the fact that the kid did not seem to notice the flaws, but it did not do a lot good for my relationship with the other volunteers. I redoubled my effort at the beginning of my th and final year of college. I moved into a house with some of the other volunteer who I wa closest to. I had to quit my research, and I could not keep my grade where I wanted them, but camp planning wa progressing well, especially after our national organization took notice of the lack of effort on my co-director is part and added a third director, my friend and newly minted roommate A. A helped enormously, but I still had so much on my plate. To cope with the stress, my drug use started to skyrocket. I wa smoking weed and cigarette all the time, and to keep up with all my biochemistry coursework and - planning meeting a week I wa taking my prescribed adderall more often than I should have been. I became thoroughly addicted. In my final quarter of school, everything really fell apart. I wa completely overwhelmed, and became le and le effective at my job. I put A in the exact position that I had been in the previous year. I could feel him resent me more and more every day, but I wa too ashamed to talk to him about it, and he never asked me how I wa doing. I barely graduated. As soon a school wa over I quit adderall cold turkey, because it had been putting me in a very dangerous mental headspace for weeks, but until then it had remained a necessity. The withdrawal hit me like a truck. Getting out of bed felt like a truly herculean task. I wa an empty husk of a human being and from graduation to camp in August I contributed almost nothing to the camp. I had nothing left to give. A hated me by that point. He began to tell people what he thought of me, and they listened. I watched helplessly a some of my closest friend and roommate began to look down upon me, if not for what A wa saying then for my severely depressed behavior. I could not even really blame them. After camp, when we had our traditional fun award ceremony, A wa awarded Most likely to make camp happen by himself . I wa awarded Linger , a camp song I wa known for singing, but also a very pointed jab. It wa humiliating. At the afterparty that night I drunkenly told A everything. He said it wa ok, and I cried lying drunk on the porch. I lived in the house with him for a few more month while I looked for a job. A wa incredibly distant, and became more and more hostile over time. I got a job on a crab boat. I had a few reason for doing it, but the most important reason in my head wa that I might be lucky enough for it to kill me. The day I moved out A sent me a paragraph essay over text, detailing everything I would ever done that had disappointed him, and letting me know that there wa nothing I could ever do to win his respect back. I left the state to work on the crab boat. For month I lived in isolation, either working or chain smoking weed to keep myself from ruminating on all my failures. The crab boat did almost kill me. Multiple times, in fact. In the end I quit, not because I wa suddenly afraid to die, but because my captain wa the most sadistic piece of human scum I would ever met, and I could not take him any more. I have spent the month since then trying to find a job. apps out and I am no closer than when I started. I have been up to visit the city I graduated in twice, but both time I have been wracked with crippling anxiety. I can tell how A affected the opinion of some of my closest friends, and it kill me. So, that is where I am. I am going to go smoke a cigarette and pray that I get my dad is cancer even younger than he did.",0.0

"A song of fire and ice Hey everyone. I am on mobile so pardon my typo which will happen. I would like to take this time to thank anyone who read this a well a giving a shout out to anyone currently struggling with depression. I have a long history with Type Bipolar Disorder. Although that is not necessarily depression in itself patient who are Bipolar are bound to eventually oscillate into that emotional polarity. To give a quick summary here is what happened to me I grew up incredibly wealthy. My Father wa an ex alcoholic. My Mother died when I wa and my Father went back to drinking to cope with the loss of his wife my Mother . My Father became suicidal and threw everything we had away. We went bankrupt and I went to live with my Brother across the country. My Brothers wife left him shortly after I moved in. He became suicidal a well, ended up hospitalized. I moved back across the country again to live with my then pseudo homeless Father. One day my Father show up to my school drunk, get arrested, I am taken in by the state and put into foster care. I end up living with an incredibly poor hispanic family and eat almost nothing everyday. I have no bed. I sleep on the floor. The state then place me in an incredibly religious home where i essentially become a slave and i cook and clean nonstop for an extremely wealthy catholic couple. They do not like me Because I liked hard rock. My third stay I end up living in a small apartment with a woman who wa good at hiding her side prostitution gig and methamphetamine addiction. After all the year my Father get his life back under control. He begin dating a wealthy woman who is not a fan of me. He take prolonged stay at her home about mile away. He would visit the house to restock it with food, pay the bills, then leave again. During this time i saw my Father maybe time a year. Each encounter wa brief and lasted le than minutes. During this I still went to school, cooked, did my laundry, and did kind of normal kid stuff. The point of this story is I am an adult now who is married. I am a software engineer. I am financially stable. Regardless of how dark it get it is possible to make it out on top. You have to focus and be strong. Do whatever you need to do to survive. If anyone ha any question or would like to chat, need advice, whatever please let me know. I currently do volunteer work to aid people who suffer from Bipolar Disorder a well a others like ADHD or OCD. I also, accidentally, mentor Fatherless child on Xbox Live strange, I know . Its not easy out there and world and parent sometimes forget how hard it is being a teen. No judgement. I hope everyone ha a good night or day, depending where you are at .",0.2806

I cannot work, clean, or do anything I enjoy without it making the pain worse. I am at my witsi end. I am in the deepest hole I have ever been in.

"Cold turkey of Escitalopram So let me begin this by saying this is a terrible idea and I should definitely taper off with the help of my psychiatrist. So, earlier this year after some lack of focus and insistent lethargy eventually my parent decided to take me to a psychiatrist. One thing lead to another and I am diagnosed with depression and put on a dose of escitalopram generic form of Lexapro mg a day. Have a history of depression on my mother is side, and they had all the symptom pretty severely minus the suicidal ideation, which I believed supported their diagnosis. So a school wa finishing up and I had exam to study for, I spent most afternoon essentially consciously unconscious a I wa too tired and struggling to keep a focus on homework and related tasks. Long story short told my parent I had been taking Adderall once and a while and we talked to the psychiatrist and he wa very understanding and after trying to allow the SSRI to do it magic, he ultimately added an Adderall script to my regime. So for some month I took the addy a needed and the anti-depressant a described other than the day I forgot . So fast forward to summer and while I am feeling marginally better, I wa lead to believe the addy wa doing most of the work. So just last week I decided just to cold turkey the SSRI. Now, this wa a slight test of seeing how I would react to abstaining from the med which is an awful idea . Strangely, I have noticed no real change whatsoever from when I wa taking it to this past week of not taking it at all. I am somewhat familiar with the omen regarding stopping an anti-depressant cold turkey and the associated rebound depression and serotonin-related issues, however, I am unsure why I have not experienced anything. The optimistic side of me want to explain this a my body just being weird and being able to withstand this drug-related anomaly. The pessimistic side of me belief that it is related to escitalopram somewhat length half-life and that a nightmarish hell awaits me very soon. Just a a side note, at the same time a my depression diagnosis, I also got a blood test which delivered wonderful news that I had Lyme is Disease which after much reading, I found exhibit many trait of depression and ADHD like disorder and wa promptly treated. Now I do not proclaim to be healed a I still exhibit a sense of lethargy, however, that might just be something I have become accustomed to and given getting out of my house, I am usually able to go out and be alive. Obviously, not discussing this decision with my doctor is unnecessarily dangerous and naive, but I just do not enjoy taking the medication and this past week kind of support my idea that I do not really need to take the medication if I am able to function fine without it. Forgive me for this whole backstory of my last year, I just wa unsure if some of this information might be useful in determining what is happening. tlr got lethargic and lacked focus this last year, diagnosed with depression and Lyme is disease, been on escitalopram since spring and Adderall whenever I choose to take it since mid-Mayish. Have stopped taking escitalopram for about a week now and am not exhibiting any withdrawal or issue regarding the cold turkey. My question is am I an anomaly or am I due for a bitter time in the near future? QUICK EDIT just wanna say I tried looking up this lack of side effect from cold turkey, but all I can seem to find is the side-effects of not taking the medication, so if someone ha some website or anecdotal experience they can refer me to, that would be much appreciated",0.38786

"Hi everybody! I am new here and I want to tell my story in brief and ask you a few questions. I am now. Female. I am studying on PhD in one of the US universities. I have been suffering from different kind of psychological problem mainly, depression for year already. I always tried to handle my depression by myself. And only once, when depression became unbearable, I went to psychiatrist. I had therapy and AD for a few months. That wa about - year ago. Now I have strong depression again. I feel that I cannot handle it by myself and that I am tired of fighting it on my own. That is why I have scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist. My question . I feel that this depression is different from depression I experienced before I started to masturbate like crazy - time a day and cannot stop - it ha been like this for a few week already and I seriously started to think about involving in some homosexual relationship which I have never done before . I also started to read a lot of porno stories. . I am thinking almost constantly about suicide. I mean, I do not think about committing suicide. NO. I WANT TO LIVE. It is kind of obsessive thought playing in my mind I feel bad ..suicide..many people do that..suicide . It is kind of always in my mind. Sometimes I even have a feeling of the rope on my neck I do not think about other kind of suicide which is, probably, explained by the fact that my father hung himself . . Where am I going guys? Am I going to some serious psycho disease or what? Am I still normal I feel like I am still normal . Have you ever experienced something like this? Honestly, what I am afraid of is that at some point I might start seriously consider these suicidal thoughts. I think this is what happened to my dad. . I have been here, in the US, only for year. So, I do not know how the system works. If I come to a psychiatrist and tell her that I have these suicidal thought will she make me to be in the hospital I hate even think about this . Should I even tell her about that? Should I be very honest and open? When I went to our University Health Center to get a referral form, I did not say anything about that. So, I am a bit afraid of trusting a psychiatrist. Maybe, I do not need to tell her everything. What would be your advice? I would greatly appreciate your help. Thanks.",0.34488

Which is true, I know it is because I should study, too. But I do not. I just spend my day staying at home, listening to music and cry because I am a pathetic piece of shit. I hate my life.

"Ok I have a couple of questions..I guess. st is I finally managed to make myself an appointment with a psychiatrist it is not till May . Now I am having second thought about it. I just pretty much want to go in for an evaluation to see if there is a problem and see if maybe there is a short term solution for the suicidal thought I have been having. I have got a summer job I am leaving for in June and than I am moving to another city after that. So basically something till I am stable with where I am living and job . I assume I am only going to be able to see doctor, time before than. So nd thought have been should I just wait to see someone when I actually get settled. Also if a psychiatrist is who I want to see I have never been to anyone before for my mental health ..that is what the intake coordinator suggested. Also I wa wondering if they could hospitalize you for suicidal thought without your permission? Ok now on to the suicidal thought question and just so people know I do not feel myself to be in any immediate or near immediate danger to myself . One main thing is doe depression have to be present for suicidal thought actions? I often find my mind turn more to thought of suicide and death when I feel relatively normal mood wise. And that when I have feel really depressed the thought of suicide rarely cross my mind but the pain is more severe . I guess that is really all I have. Sorry if the topic is inappropriate for this forum. I just wanted to ask..and maybe discus with someone..but do not really feel that it is a problem for me right now. If someone want to talk in PMs I would not mind either.",0.24491
"I am sort of new.. Here is the short version I am year old man. Single. No kids. I live in Arizona USA . My father wa a workaholic, and an alcoholic. So usually he wa not present, and when he wa he wa abusive. In addition, mental illness run in my family. At the age of I wa sexually molested by a neighbor. I can recall my anxiety always being there. It is something I have always fought with especially in social situations. My family completely isolated me when I wa growing up, in the name of protecting me. As a result I never really learned social skill until I wa older. I grew up being abused by my peer throughout school. Found myself taken in by the only people who would accept me a I wa the misfits, outcasts, drug-users. Early into my teen year depression came a an addition to my anxiety. Around I started to get into substance abuse. The only thing I ever used wa LSD on weekend regularly. A year later this extended into ecstasy and LSD. I had a traumatic experience and stopped using anything about a year after that. My anxiety became so overwhelming I could not function. So at this time I first started seeing a counselor and a psychiatrist. They put me on Clonzepam. My last year in high school my father wa starting to lose it so my mother asked me to leave so we did not kill each other. I had an inheritance from another relative and I lived off that. I went whole year without speaking to my father. I sunk deep into depression, and returned to substance abuse. The Clonzepam wa not working anymore. After being outcast from my family, I went full on into the dark side. What wa just LSD and ecstasy usage branched into cocaine, meth, marijuana, and virtually anything my friend and I could find. This culminated in an extreme suicide attempt about a year out of high school. After getting out of the mental hospital, I went totally straight and have not touched any drug since then. The year following have been a rollercoaster. One moment being on top of the world, having everything I could ever want. Another losing everything. Several long horrible relationship occurred in this time. Over the year my doctor ha moved me around on various medicines. I have been using Effexor since . Currenlty I take Lamictal in addition to it. I suffer from chronic reoccurring depression, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder.",0.35833000000000004

"I have had borderline personality disorder since I wa a little kid. Although then the therapist said it wa Bipolar Disorder and ADHD. Since then I have been on pretty much every medication you can imagine and even sent to a temporary mental hospital. It is not until now that I self diagnosed myself with BPD. I do not even think my doctor really think I have that although considering all the research I have done I fit the description perfectly. Since the age of I wa being self destructive by slamming my head in the wa during time of stress. The first time I starting cutting wa when I wa . This wa after an ex boyfriend left me. We had only been dating for months. Sad huh. This went on sporadically for about a year and a half during that time I committed myself . Finally I started dating my next boyfriend. He told me if I did not stop cutting he would leave me. I stopped. We dated year and then broke up. I am now and married to another man who is year older than me. We have been married almost a year together for . year and about month ago I started cutting again. This time it is time worse and I cannot seem to stop. I am covered in scar and I have even gone a far a cutting the inside of my wrist. I am currently on Wellbutrin which doe seem to be working I do have a lot of good day . Although since I started to become depressed again I have been having a hard time dealing with the fact that my husband ha a son. It did not bother me a much just a little before because I did my best to stay busy. Since I got married I lost all my friend and now spend every other weekend alone. Mostly in bed. I never had to play mom before so I never thought I would ever be in the position to, so I just stayed out of the way. Plus, his son doe not like me being around. Which make me feel worse. In my state of mind I cannot deal with that. My alone time is when I cut the most. My husband and I are in therapy, my therapist want u to work. I am not so sure I can stay with him. Although I am having a hard time leaving. I am just so tired of feeling so alone all the time and he is just not capable of being there for me. This put extra stress on him and I do not want that. Plus, it is my fault I married him, I knew he had a kid. I guess I did not know I would get bad again. Last week we talked about me leaving. He ran upstairs and cried he said he will fight for me I went straight for the exacto knife. I had suicide in mind although I see myself a a wimp in that area which make me feel even worse about myself. I cut time on the inside of my wrist but I guess not deep enough. He came down and found me. My antidepressant work almost of the time but whenever I think of losing my husband I get sad and hopeless.

"Feeling trapped in my head First off I am Autistic, I am studying at Oxford I am struggling to remember anything, like anything at all, people, faces, dates, facts, etc. I am feeling more and more alone because I do not feel like I have anything good to think about. I have a girlfriend, she is in the force and ha a lot of structure and meaning to her life and I like that but I see my life a completely pointless. So about a year I wa cycling in the dark and I wa hit by a car, I flew over the bonnet and hit my head. I wa out for about half an hour, till I regained conscience in the back of an ambulance, and the crew were cutting off my clothes and pumping me full of morphine. Before this accident I had a very good memory, and my parent would say I could talk about anything that had happened from when I wa a child. I wa having some weird relationship at the time with different people, and I only came out to them after I wa in hospital for a month after the accident, I did not want to say anything because I did not want to worry them. I valued their feeling more over my own life, and I still do that now with other people. Things started to crash after the accident, I lost people really good friend and I knew it wa me, and I changed and something during that accident had altered me, and I hated it. I started to forget people very quickly and event that had happened and horribly people who had died and continuously not realising they had died. That upset a lot of people. Before everything happened I had broken up with a girl but i did not realise that after , now I cannot remember what we did together or even how we met, but I cannot get the thought of her out my head, she later told me to leave never come back, which I did. But even now I still have the feeling of thought of her, and I am struggling to get rid of that, I do not love her and I am not in love her, I just feel like i am obsessed with her a person I know nothing about and It haunt me. I have been to a few separate doctor and have been recommended medication, which I believe it ha just made it worse. I have talk to my parent but they just talk highly of the pro is of medication and councillors. Hate councillors. I always ended up lying to them Since everything I have had some real down point, and made two attempts, by failed due to people walking in randomly either whilst in progress or while setting up. I have already made necessary precaution by writing letters, addressing them and stamping them but non have been sent. I want to tell my gf but I feel like, I do not want to throw feeling away by her thinking he is a sobbing kid, or he is crazy or why am I with him - I would rather hide it not to upset her, people mean everything in the world to me, and I would give my life for her, any day.

It wa not. His brother made a post on Facebook letting everyone know. It felt like a bad dream. I could not stop crying. I cried at work.

The last time we talked he said that is my sweetheart, that is my pride and joy. I sat with him in the hospital and watched Aubrey Hepburn. We promised to see each other again soon. I saw him a week later in hospice. He wa catatonic. I told him it wa okay to let go, okay to move on if he wa in pain. They say hearing is the final sense to go. He died thirty minute after I left.

I really do hope I can get some insight on this particular issue however. For so long I have been completely alone and it really sucked. I managed to connect with my Cousin a couple of year ago and we have had a lot of great times, but more often than not lately it seems I feel bad after dropping her off instead of good that we hung out. We have hung out like time a week for a couple year now. I feel like we have a real connection but she doe not show it if she feel the same. I am an alcoholic and so is she, so we drink together a lot. I certainly would be able to quit if I did not have to drink to be around her.

She is CONSTANTLY lying to me about everything. She is so very unreliable, in the last week twice now she is made plan with me for the next day, only to show up on facebook at like pm after I have been sitting and waiting for her all day and then she get angry with me for telling her it make me feel like shit. Everything is always about her, she is even more depressed than me and ha none of the coping skill I do so most of the time it is just her bringing up all her problem and me trying to reassure her.

I know she is not really a friend more of a company prostitute if anything, it seems like I am always having to buy the booze or lend her money she never pay back. I know I am being blatantly used, but the company is still better than being alone with my thought all of the time. She actually ghosted me about a year ago for a few month and that put me in a really bad place, I had to check into the psych ward I wa in such a rut over it.

"I do not think who try to kill themselves actually want to die From my experience and one of a close friend who almost died in a car accident, I think people do not really want to die. We just want the pain to go away. All the shit we take and all the heavy baggage we have to carry, just make u tired and lose hope When we ponder on death, we see an easy way out, so a to get rid of the unbearable agony we suffer. Moreover, I watched a video of suicide survivors. About those who survived suicide, claimed that in their final moments, when they were throwing themselves from a high place, they said they would regret everything and wanted to live. Now imagine all those who died and regretted in the last moments. Personally, I have been close to do it, but my online friend gave me so much support and so much love that I noticed that it is not worth it. I still have thing I want to do. Sure getting out of bed is still a huge task. Today it took me hour just to do it, but I did it. I am not sure if I should have posted this in suicide or here a it ha to do with both.

I wish I could care about those thing again but I cannot so suggesting to do those things, a if I wanted to stop, is like a punch to the face. Oh your depressed? Just do what you like. No. I do not want to. I do not want thing I loved and feel nothing. It hurt to want to enjoy life and cannot. To want to care and you just cannot. I have tried medication and therapy. I have tried giving so many fuck and I cannot. I cannot even fake it anymore. I wish I could. How do I care again? Do I just wait? I do not think much longer.",0.3918200000000001

Another reason for wanting to quit is I am currently a student and I am in the last leg of my final year dissertation, I just do not want the stress of having to go deal with my bos and having to take order etc when I have this important deadline coming up.

"I feel trapped in a life I do not want to live. It took a lot of time for me to consider posting here but I am gonna be alone for the whole day and cannot deal with it. So, hi, I am just your typical British kid dealing with the stress of College but the problem is that I am not stressed because of college I do not really care much for it but it is better then work , I am stressed because of this constant cycle of wake up, spend an hour trying to get up, be minute late to everything every day, eat, browse the Internet and sleep. All around me there is people who have clear career path and know what they are passionate about, but I look at myself and realise that I do not have that. I have no interest in working in a job for the next year of my life because there is nothing that I would like doing. I am doing fine in all of my class As in History and Cs in Maths, Distinctions in BTEC Engineering, everything just feel too simple but I just still get these week where I feel worthless and pointless. I get brain fog, I end up teary eyed and cannot talk to anybody for fear of looking stupid I have speech problem . But then when I end up actually talking to others I apparently look happy. I have spoken to people at my school about it, but it is the same thing every time. Oh you are struggling? We will have a five minute conversation about your feeling and wait month to make sure you are not still sad . I wa diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I stopped taking medication in July and have not seen a doctor or therapist since. They did not help, the medication I wa on turned me into a god damn zombie and my therapist got exceptionally pissy at me for not telling the truth about my lack of improvement. I felt like I had to lie so I did not waste their time and mine, I worry that is why I end up wearing a mask of the time. Even around my family, who believe more in self-help then actually getting an actually decent therapist to try and help me. I am ashamed to talk to them about it, no matter what anyone says, trust me when I say that they will NOT understand. I have been incredibly clear about it all and got mocked for it, some people just do not want to learn. I had a pretty bad childhood that I try to justify my problem with dealt with a lot of sexual abuse and my mother died in but when I am having these wouldays I am not thinking about anything in particular that would make me flighty. I ended up admitting a lot of my past to one teacher last week who I admire greatly and whom pretty much just saved my life and I am still cringing today. I know I have no reason to cringe either, I just get so nervous of social interaction. I just do not get why the universe picked me to be it miserable little experiment. I never asked for anything bad to happen, I never asked to constantly feel tired and under the weather, I know that life is not gonna be perfect but why is it that day after dull as day I have to feel worse and worse? I try to take responsibility for my health, I feel like dirt, I have other people have some part in it and they take it for granted and hardly any of them actually make a big effort on me.

"I walked out of a job yesterday. I took my wouldream job in early January, only to discover that it is not my dream job at all. I thought I would like working in a medical office, but this particular medical office ha two doctors, one part-time staff member, and a cluster of other problems. I quit on Friday the owner asked me to come in yesterday and meet, and I did, but I did not stay long, because she did not show up and the other doctor on staff acted like my resignation never even happened. I have compiled a list of why I quit. Here is a short sample - I hate the hour A-P day a week, A-P day a week an hour lunch break wa promised in the new hire handbook but is frowned upon by staff a a lack of commitment dedication - There are religious currents, including periodic prayer meeting throughout the day. I wa treated dismissively when I objected and stated I am not religious. The owner is okay with the prayers, and say it brings staff closer together. - I wa offered a management position, but after being hired, wa told I know nothing, and might manage eventually, but right now wa incapable of doing so. - I wa trained for three or so day before being expected to run insurance billing, keep room clean and do therapies, and run the front desk. - Staff is expected to remain available on evening and weekend for PR events. I know that quitting wa the best decision - sticking it out would have been detrimental to my mental health, and I would have had no time to interview for other opportunities. Still, at the same time, I cannot help but feel like a burden to my husband. After leaving yesterday, I hiked mile to the top of an area mountain really just a big hill, it is a foothill mountain and had a conversation with myself a to whether or not I intended to jump. I intentionally did not take my gun with me because I never know. I am afraid of being a disappointment, and I am afraid of never being a conventional, functional human. I am second guessing my decision to leave. I already have other opportunity presenting themselves to me and I am lucky enough to have some money put away.. but I do not want to be a failure. I can feel depression symptom creeping up on me again, and I am trying to fend them off. I forced myself into a per-diem position today, just to keep in a routine.

I just get this feeling of dread when I think about getting ready and actually leaving, and all I feel like I can do is lie in bed thinking about different way I could kill myself I am not going to, it is just something I seem to always end up thinking about in bed, I know it is toxic but it is comforting . I really cannot miss any more class after today, this semester is really important for my grades. I feel like such a piece of shit for missing them two day in a row, this is the exact sort of thing that fucked up my grade last term. Idk it would be nice to talk to someone, about anything even.

"Does Trading Help Your Depression? Maybe I am a bit weird in this regard, but I do quiet well in this regard.

But within the past few months, whenever I found out someone died, I did not really feel bad for their family, I mostly wa kind of jealous that they were gone and I wa still here. For example, my mom manages a nursing floor at a hospital. She told me one of her nurse is daughter died of a deadly disease at . And all I could think about wa at all I could think wa how jealous I wa of the deceased young woman, and how lucky she was. No ill will to her, I hope she rest in peace and that her family is coping. Another example. When I wa in high school, someone I knew had an older brother than went out drinking one night and when he came home, he died, choking on his own vomit.

"I feel really bad for not coming to the forum much last week. i have been in turmoil. Things at home are not going well at all. My husband got his new house and is moving in the next few week .. incidentally that is not the problem. I am happy that he is leaving. He ha been a real jerk lately. He say mean thing to me and he is angry all of the time. He ha been working on the road for the past month so we only have to tolerate each other on the weekend - thank goodness. When he come home the first thing that he doe is go up to the computer room and say hi to his buddy .. not to me and not to our son in fact he only spend a total of one hour with our son on the weekend . When he finally grace u with his presence he just complains. I did SO much work around the house last week - I cut the grass, weeded the garden, watered the lawn everyday, vacuumed the house from top to bottom, washed the floor on the main floor of the house, did all of the laundry, patched some dent in the wall and painted them, cleaned out our son is room .. and still he managed to find thing that were wrong . He even had the audacity to tell me that I am a pig and nothing get done around here. I just cannot take it anymore. All he doe is get angry and complain. I finally realized this weekend that I am not his problem. He is just using me a an excuse. I have tried to talk to him and all he want to do is play the blame game. We have agreed to not see each other for the month of august so that each of u can decide what it is that we want to do regarding our relationship. Even that ticked him off. When I asked him if he would like me to send our son with his parent when they come to visit him he got mad that I wa not going to come see him. The no seeing each other in August wa entirely his idea. I have no clue what is going on in his head. I have tried and tried to talk to him and the only reply I get is defensive or aggressive. I am at my wit end and am about to give up. I care very much for him and I know that there is something wrong but I cannot help him. I am so afraid of giving up on u though because I am riddled with the what ifs . I want a family so bad. am I settling though? I hate saying that because my husband is not a terrible man. He ha his finer quality it is just that lately they are few and far between. He ha even told me that he would cheat on me if given the chance. And that he might have while drunk one night and that the girl ha told other people that the baby she is carrying might be his. You know the more that I write the more I feel like an idiot. What a fucking doormat. What the hell am I doing? i am putting my happiness and wellbeing on the back burner for someone who ha told me repeatedly that he no longer love me and think that he ha had an affair or at the least would like to . How pathetic can you get. What a glutton for punishment I am. Why is it that I feel that he is more important than me? You know I thought that I wa doing better on the medication - I might not be having the emotional outburst but I still have the low - or should I say non-existent self esteem. If only all of this could be over. If only he could either WAKE up and figure out what he want to do or just fuck off and never see me or our son again. That would make my life so much easier. I fear for my son. I do not want my husband is anger to hurt our son. I do not want husband to take out his frustration on a two year old. I worry about sending our son to visit him. Without me there or the dogs, xx is the only one there to take the abuse. Anyway that is what I have been dealing with the past week. As a result of all of this I have been on a self destruct mode.

"I have been so depressed over a lost friendship. I have known this girl for about years. We were very close or so I thought. We both had boy around the same age, went on vacation together with our families, and both went through our nd pregnancy together.

She said How can you call and act like nothing is wrong? Then she hang up on me. I wait until the next day and called again. First thing she say is What do you want? I say Just to be your friend. She say We are no longer friends. There will be no more double dating with our husbands, vacations, you are to not come to my house, We are not friend . I wa blown away. I asked what I did and she could not give me a direct answer. She said we had different friend and I had more drama than any of her friend of years. I asked her what drama? Last year I had some problem with my husband but I did not really talk to her about that. She said that wa a problem, I did not tell her thing and that is what friend do. WHAT?

"My purpose for posting this is that I am at a dead end and do not know where else to turn. I am and I am sure have been suffering from depression most my whole life. My life ha been one failure after another, in relationships, jobs, and anything else. I had been on antidepressant for about year and then stopped after I got arrested for a DUI and felony hit and run. The man who wa injured received a cut on his face after chasing after me when I split the scene, that wa the whole extent of his injuries. After the arrest I wa feeling so bad it made no difference whether I took them or not. The charge were dropped but I had to wait day after day for a year or more just waiting for them to recharge me, which my attorney wa sure they were going to do. That wa year ago and I think the experience did some very serious and real damage to me. I just lost my job in my probationary period of months. I have worked so hard to create some kind of financial security for myself BA in Psychology, technical degree in computers, numerous computer certification but where ever I go I do not fit in to the group and find myself alienated and let go. Some many failed romantic relationships, never having friends, and what family member I have are abusive and are incapable of providing healthy support. Most night I calm myself enough to fall asleep by fantasizing about killing myself and the relief that wa provide. I feel like a freak physically. I shortened my finger on my right hand by inch and my hand is deformed because I hit the wall in my apartment one night about year ago after I wa let go from a job and my girlfriend broke up with me at the same time.

"Is it better to find out your love wa a lie, or never to have loved at all? Last year, after year of marriage, my wife say she never loved me, ha never found me attractive who can blame her , and doe not think we have ever been right for each other. She only married me because she felt pressured from family and church to get married, and I wa a good guy , a she put it. This crushed me. She ha been everything to me. I have always loved her so much. My whole marriage ha always been a fairy tale for me, it wa everything I wanted. This wa the girl of my dreams. I remember thinking when we were dating that it wa too good to be true that any girl, especially one a amazing a my wife, would ever like me, since I am shy, boring, and ugly. I guess I wa right, it wa too good to be true, and I should have trusted my gut and known it back then. After a year of trying to find way to connect with her, make myself more attractive to her, and hoping she would love me, I have finally accepted that she never will. We are staying together for the kid is sake, and really for mine, what else would I do, no one else could ever love me, and I doubt I could ever really love anyone else the way I loved my wife. I have accepted that I will never have love. It make me wonder, is it better to have thought I had love, and enjoyed it, only to find out it wa lie, or never to have loved at all. At this point I really do not know.",0.20383
"My Fictional Home I stared outside, and watched the cold atmosphere awake me. The sun is ray blocked by the magnificent beauty above u all an urban scape filling my view around me. I felt a grave sadness strike all in the same spot for my daily routine, crippling what wa left of my head. I grabbed the bicycle, and went along the path to any good in my life. A nearly missed accident up ahead, I reminded myself. I hit the button to change colors, and awaited a stop that could mean a sour tardiness or a decent morning. The color changed fast, and I hastily sped across the line between me and the other side. I arrived, striking the pavement at full speed ahead down the rubber sidewalk. A straight path to follow, a new future to envelop soon enough. The fact of the matter wa that I had to pray to a god I did not believe in if I wanted to warp my happy spirit to glorious utopia. Logic override heart quite rarely, leaving a snowflake and a shock of noise behind the mind that just want it all to change. My bored mind only somewhat consciously bobbed his head around from side to side, keeping an eye on the reflective sign for a change of heart. The observant man coming by on a bicycle or on his own two leg could notice the hurting expression that shone on my face. An insomnia that ha outlasted it course, half a heart to spare to the one it belongs to, and the tonne lying on his stubby shoulders. Whether the man is out to care for their dog, the mail, something they always take a look to glance at the face of a broken child, often not realizing the fine detail in the street light glowing on my frozen cheeks. What did it take to find redemption? I often wondered, a grand sunlight wa walking upstairs to knock the moon off it is sleepy stool. I sat and watched a beautiful red giant approach, and drew image in mind to flicker about and echo in my concave dome of secrets. As the flickering opportunity ran full speed in front of me, I turned and felt the imagery toss into the incinerator. A great insecurity washed over the industry working ahead up above, slowing me down a I walked in slowly toward the place to call work. I sat the bicycle at it is rack, hand in pocket a I blinked at the glaring sun. A numbness hit my heart, and for the next eight hours, I would lose who I was, only coming back at the rise of a pounding rain. I walked from a distant building, taking the long path to a home that did not know me. I took the rugged bicycle, and stared up above at the shadowy clouds. I leaned forward over the handlebars, watching the pattern fly past my visions. I lifted up again, opening my voice to play a tune, looking for a face to redeem my little work. I went onward, and stared at the home that forgot me. I walked slowly up, placing the bicycle just where it was, hitting the kickstand which had sacrificed my ankle some. I opened the door, giving a brief greeting. I entered the meeting room of regret and lost innocence, stroking my hand over what wa a cuddly friend. My vision blurred, feeling the great exhaustion from the night prior taking me over. I curled in the corner, feeling the toilet flushing the pent up pain from an earlier disembarkment of a peanut gallery. I hugged the one thing that brought a soothing to my life, and proceeded to let out an ugly sob, trying to remember who everyone was, a I grabbed a broken mirror, staring at who the blurry stranger wa in it. I felt myself faint, awaking to two stranger cycling the door between storage and the hand of all waiting for me. What were you thinking? the woman asked, What did you say? the man asking. I do not know. I responded, lying on my side, a they both awkwardly stepped out, with a cracked expression of what wa me walking out. I felt a blankness ride across my body, a I stared upon a wall that reminded me of life. I sat stationary, and buried my head under a recording of a person with nothing left. I held my heart, staring out at the dark that I wanted to escape in. A length that no person dared, but a low that felt necessary. I felt an unnecessary realism flow through me, a my arm folded, feeling a coldness drip down my neck. I got up, and went to the porch of attempting life again. A moon vanished above me, showing a pine away from me only just by some measurements. The bicycle appeared broken on the road, a I walked to what I remember being the last resort in this world. I walked to a reused bench, and stared out at the murky water that felt like memories. I looked to my left, seeing a young boy sitting in the back of a delinquent is wagon, and to my right a child amongst a smaller group, enjoying the finer delicacy of life. In between it all, a fool. I cracked my bubbly back, a a soreness hit my veins. I stood slowly, my body tossing and turning inside. The world turned askew, a the sun beat slowly onto my flustered body. I took flight across the ramp of a broken dream, taking a flip that would ruin me for a day. A nostalgia for the life that wa simple broke me down slowly, a I felt my walking slow down. I sat by a curb, watching a teenager go away from a regretful sunset on a bench. He sported a terrible frown, forgetting of the one. A light flew by at fast speeds, turning away from my stretched out legs, a a noise emitted from it is front. I stared blankly into the street, feeling my mind shatter into many jagged pieces. A dam blocked the feeling of humanity and a progress of going up in the world. I picked up the pieces, attaching them to my hurting consciousness. I stomped back to a filthy bed, staring into the bright light that fueled no purpose. I spread a message, the bait missing all parties. I collapsed, waking to a time of no reply. I logged into what made time fly by, and felt the pain of month wash away within seconds. A second half had joined, and I forgot about all the thing around me for the next year. Dawn upon myself shined my sleepy public work to let out a shrieking cry, standing over a bin full of scrap and desperation to fix my bleeding innards. I panicked into a corner, awaiting life is worst terrors. I stood to nothing, and returned to a hamper of depression. I stared at the dusty fan blade fly full speed, breathing in only to glance at the horrid truth. A shadow stood behind my forgotten figure, taunting the fullness above it. I wore a jacket and yelled at it, and it shyly walked. I took a deep breath and walked outside toward the bench once again, staring out at the beautiful waters. A creature came from the waters, approaching me. I held it hand, standing up accordingly. The creature pushed me into a pit full of spikes, a I awoke to half of me missing. I felt a burning inside of me, a my inside waned into a fine drawing of genitalia, washing the deliberate feeling and thought around my head, causing me to let out of a horrific screech of losing a natural ability. My body awoke in a new person is home, a I stared out into the busy road below my sleepy figure. An old woman came out from the corner, a I nervously responded with a gulp. We shared an exchange, a I sat and pondered the shelf of a life that I knew little about. I explored the past, only finding multiple recording of enthusiasts. I folded my hands, recognizing that I meant nothing here. The plane flew slowly away, a the shock went away from my skull, a my heart wa left with a small hole. I sat and could not breathe, only feeling a great pain a we jumped into the chair of obnoxious actions. I sat and thought, glancing at the broken mirror. It wa me.",0.0
"I am sitting here at what is my th or th job I can barely keep count. I am year old by the way . I already hate it and I have been here one month today. I do not think it is normal to have this many job over a lifetime, let alone when you are just in your late is. I have applied for disability before but wa denied. I do not dispute the fact that I can get a job, I just cannot keep a job. I get bored, I get anxiety attacks, I get to the point where I do not want to go outside at all. I will never be able to work successfully with all those thing going on. When I went to see an attorney to appeal my disability decision, he said I should find a job with minimal responsibility. What kind of job is that? Do not you have to be responsible enough to at least come to work and on time ? Do not you have to be responsible to follow the rule of the job? I cannot seem to do either one. Each job I get, I think maybe this can be the job I can stay at and it never happens. The longest I have ever stayed at a job is year. I just feel like such a loser. Everyone I know always say they will do whatever kind of job for their kids, or I should be lucky to have a job. I can see their point, but when I feel so miserable I cannot see past that.

"Hi, everyone - new to these forum board thingies so please forgive me if this doe not end up being posted in the right place! I have lived with depression since I wa year old I am now . For the past year I have been managing this condition without the aid of drug or stimulants. My life changed the day I stopped fighting the condition and accepted it a part of who I was.

For those of you who are still in the depth of darkness, please do not give up hope, there are many of u out here who, have experienced exactly what you are going through now, we survived - so can you. Recovery is possible, it just take time and a little faith in yourself.

"Lonely and stupid. I feel so stupid. I have always been academic and studious- if anything, I have dedicated my existence to the pursuit of knowledge, at the expense of forming human relationships. But I am constantly overwhelmed by how much I do not know, how slow I am to understand concepts, and how my peer are all more intelligent than me. I know it is impossible to always be the smartest person in the room, but I feel that the fruit of my study are disproportionate to my efforts. At the same time, I have conflicting feeling over my loneliness. I desire human interaction, but others find me rigid and distant. In all honesty, I am easily bored by small talk and trivial discussions. I understand that it is important in forming friendships, but my under-stimulated brain seems to automatically ishut-off after a while. I have noticed that the people I do get along with are like me. Introverted, cold, and academic. We do not see each other a people, but a enlightened book with fresh concepts. These idea are interesting to explore. If the book is lost, we are disappointed but not crushed. We were never bound by friendship we were tied by our interest and perhaps mutual isolation. I do not feel an ounce of human warmth from these acquaintances.",0.27623000000000003
"I think i am okay, but in reality and in hindsight I am completely not okay. I think I am literally dying day by day. Hello to anyone out there, I am just a good guy who did not come from much and I am trying my best to live a fulfilling life but I do not think I can anymore because of this illness. I use to be quite a geek a a kid and love video game and playing with others and having fun. I remember when I use to look forward to coming home from elementary school or middle school and just do my homework and then game away. It wa so much fun then and I felt like I wa genuinely pretty happy. Now a day I feel like i am just literally dead. I do not do anything, I cannot sleep, I hardly eat because I cant find the motivation to go out and get food.. and over the past year I have noticed that depression really ha taken a toll on me mentally and physically. It suck so bad that I genuinely think I will probably die prematurely and die lonely. I have no friends, no acquaintances, and just family that do not understand anything about what i am going through. To be honest I wish I wa never born. I wish i did not exist because facing the world is killing me. Just the other day I thought about all the opportunity i have missed out on because of my depression. Like internships, jobs, career fairs, fun event and even a potential awesome friend but all of that is not going to happen because i am a dead a a rock. I turned a couple day ago and no one even said happy birthday..Not even family. At this point i am looking at my future and it looking dim. I have simply lost the meaning of living. I have no self esteem, no confidence, nothing. Maybe people like me do not deserve to live a good life, perhaps we ought to die and just get over it. If there wa someone who can tell me my fate i will want to listen to it now. I just cannot anymore. I fucking just want to run the bridge and jump off but sadly i recognize that I only have one life. I am hoping and hoping maybe everything can turn around for me but what are the odds to be honest. I might a well have a heart attack and just die. I hate this. I am lonely, i am always sad and i am just a piece of shit that is worthless. Good Bye everyone. I hope you have all had an awesome day. As for me everyday is the same and if thing do not change soon I think i will rather end it. Not even graduating college meant anything for me. I fucking hate myself!",0.28570999999999996
"I feel doubt about my relationship when I am depressed? I am M. I am gay and I have been with my boyfriend J for five months. I used to be severely depressed. But lately my life ha been pretty good. But sometimes I get into a depressed mood and I start having doubt about my relationship. Honestly nothing is really wrong between us. But sometimes I feel like I do not really love him, and that we do not actually have any chemistry. And I do not know why I feel that way. I start nitpicking our relationship and try to find flaw in it to justify how I feel. But other time we will both be in a good mood, and the spark is totally there, and I feel great about everything. I am starting to think that this is just what my brain default to when I am sad, and that there is nothing actually wrong with us. For example this weekend I wa feeling great, then on Sunday my parent had a conversation with me that really triggered me, and now I am feeling depressed and doubting my relationship. The conversation with my parent had nothing to do with my boyfriend. Basically it seems like whenever I feel down, my brain immediately jump to maybe I should break up with my boyfriend. I do not know if this is a sign that something is actually wrong, or if this is just what a depressed brain does. Does anyone else experience this? Is this common?",0.2887

We work together and she liked me alot but since im a manager and shes an employee, we had to keep it a secret but people were already starting to spread rumor about u and my GM who wasntnearly a suspicious about it cut her hour and day for this week and i asked why. His response wa that she wa flirting with alot of other guy and it wa becoming a problem so he cut her day to just this week.

"Advice for getting back in touch with everyday life? I think the hardest thing for me, and the largest factor I need to address to try and feel healthy again, is simply trying to feel engaged in and enjoying the present. Right now, day have little to no meaning at all, and I am only really able to think of my life in term of weeks, months, and years. As a result of that, I feel nothing from the hobby or moment that would before provide me feeling of joy, satisfaction or just generally fulfilling myself. The only activity I really enjoy anymore is anything that provides me with a complete escape from reality, however these activity are not exactly one belonging to a healthy lifestyle. I just want to enjoy the thing that I used to enjoy, but whenever I try I feel like I am wasting my time, are not doing them well enough.

"Thank You ArtChick and Tempesta , all of you who have been here for me. I am so glad that you all understand. I really want to get out from behind this trapped door. My life is so controlled and he doe not even see it. He denies it when i bring it up. I cry because i cannot buy thing for my child or grandchildren. This is not the way it is suppose to be. One of the reason I do not make it to church on some Sundays is because I do not have clothes to wear. I have a pair of black jean i keep switching jacket and shirt so i do not look the same every Sunday. My daughter bought me a nice dress and it wa warm enough last Sunday to wear it. I guess i should not care about what people think and all the people at my church are wonderful, not judgmental. I do go to the Lord in Prayer every morning and study my Bible. I feel content because we are supposed to give all our worry to him and not get in his way of taking care of them. I know God is working in my life, my daughter finding this site is just one of the way i know. my husband just got a job after being out of work for a year. I prayed for that too.

"I suffer from major depression too and I have taken almost all of the SSRI is but the only one that really helped me wa Lexapro. I took it for around month is, then decided that I did not want to become addicted to another medication so I just stopped taking it and it did not bother me at all. I have been taking mil of Elavil at bedtime which is also an antidepressant but I take it to help me sleep. It used to help control my depression but it doe not anymore and really doe not help me sleep either. Have you ever tried Lexapro? I think it is the best SSRI one can be on and I had no side effect while taking it so you might want to ask your doctor about it.

I have been told that one chooses to be happy or unhappy but I certainly do not choose to be unhappy and I do not know anyone who would. I am a devout Christian and I know that my depression is not coming from God but I am letting the Devil tell me that I am depressed. Maybe God is just trying to bring me closer to Him and I need to lay my burden of depression at His foot and tell him that I cannot get through this alone, then just forget about it but for me it is not that easy.

"Hello. I am just getting over a suicide attempt, my nd. It wa extremely serious. I wa planning it for week, and when I wa fired form my job I did it the next day. I have a BS in chemistry and worked testing pharmacological products, so i knew what to take. I do not know what made me call my ex-BF. I did not speak to him for months, but I wanted him to be the one to find me. Needless to say I lived. The doctor where surprised that I did. I took things, not going to give people idea that i knew they could not do anything for because of them being together. They could not pump my stomach cause of the one thing. They could not give any antidote cause of interactions. I took well over the lethal limit. My life wa spiraling out of control since Jan of . Since then, I have had heart and cancer operations. I wa discharged from the Navy, wa an officer, because of the medical stuff. My st suicide attempt wa in the navy, they chalked it up to being stupid and not dealing with the st heart and cancer surgeries. My parent had a bitter divorce and I wa caught in the middle when I got home. My mother assumed my ID and ran up a bunch of bills. I came out of the closet. I slept around to feel wanted. Which wa not a wise choice, I gained my rd major medical situation. Not going to say what, but I am sure you can figure it out. I have a soul mate that I hurt, my ex-BF, and who know if we will ever be friend or more. wa a blur. I do not remember things, or saw thing that where not there. Like documentation, which led to me being fired. I wa afraid to leave the house, and wa even afraid of year old selling candy for the school. The good thing about the suicide attempt is there wa a proper diagnosis. I compartmentalized, and pushed emotion away. Every situation or moment had it own little box, and I put it away. I wanted to be like Spok or Data. I would put on different mask for different situations. There wa shopping me, gas pumping me, heck, i had a separate mask for every action I performed. I have abandonment issues, from how i wa treated growing up. Medicines did nothing and gave bad side effects. My depression is not chemical, but mental. I need to re-learn how to think and handle emotion and issue properly. Unemployment is running out, people are looking for money for bills. But it is better to be alive.

Then she asked me if I brought it in and I told her no that I mailed it. And she said that I could not have because it wa not scanned by the post office.

My therapist looked over the information that I sent her and she said that everything basically fit with what I am going through and DID. The problem is, she doe not treat dissociative disorder and ha no idea how to even help me. I appreciated her honesty though. But she said she know a therapist in Jeffersonville, IN..oh God..that treat dissociative patient but I do not drive and Carol is not going to take me over to Jville on a weekly basis for therapy. Also, we have never even been over there before so we would get lost. So, she then called her bos and another lady to see if they knew who else in Louisville could help me and to see if she can get some help on treating me. I also gave her more info on some of the thing I am dealing with and the voice that are going on. I even gave her the name of the two that I already know of. She said the fact that I cannot remember my childhood and that I not only lose time for minute but also for day that it is not normal and we need to figure out how to help me. I have been in the mental health system since and have had just about every diagnosis slapped on me. I hope I can finally get some help. I am honestly about to give up. She also said that she is going to see if they can take me off the Seroquel since it is making me sick and NOT WORKING. So, she asked me what else I have been on and I told her Haldol - did not work, Risperdal - did not work, Zyprexa - did not work, Paxil Paxil CR - worked for a little bit then wore off, Wellbutrin - did not work . She said that she want to try Depakote, Abilify, or another mood stabilizer. I also took those two journal entry in that I posted last week so she could read them. And, I wish I could get it scanned but it did not look right to me so I cannot show them to you that is why I just typed it and she said that one of the interesting thing that stood out about the entry is that the handwriting wa different in three places. I am a mess. But believe it or not, after today is session I am a little hopeful. In other news, Carol and I have started working on our book of poetry. We have been throwing around idea all day and working out some details. We are in the process of getting the poem we want to be in the book together and coming up with a title which we have already done . We are also working on the different category that we want the poem to fall under. I have been working around with PagePlus for a couple of hour now trying to figure out how we can set this up. She also ha a list of publisher that we are going to be going through a well. I am also still working on getting around to doing some update on my webpage and trying to budget out how I can pay for my site so I can get more space and get rid of those damn banner ads. I am moving a fast a I can but right now I am having some sinus issue again .",0.5166700000000001
"I take it that by you saying Learn to give rather than take and you will find life turn around! that you are implying that I am a taker and not a giver. And maybe that is so. Maybe all the blood that I have donated it give me a sense of purpose and sometimes it seems that the nurse there are the only one who care that I am alive, and that is only because of what my body produce or the time when I do thing out of the kindness of my heart rather than for monetary gain or a a mean to earn someone is favor or to make them somehow indebted to me like others would do, maybe doing all that still mean that I am a taker. I do not know. I have been told that my perception cannot really be trusted, but that doe not sound like someone who is a taker to me. I am . And by that age most guy have been in at least one relationship. I have not. That is why I have set the timeframe. Everyone I know ha had at least a taste of love and human companionship by the time they were . So I have decided that if no one want me, why stay? Living alone mean seeing what I want on TV..and having absolutely no one to enjoy or discus it with. That is my view of it. Pessimistic? Yes, but it is been the truth for me.

"Okay, here is the deal. I am , and I have been depressed and suicidal for a long a i can remember. See the post God Hates Me I just want to die. I hate living. It feel like no one cares. In order to combat my depression I write. To date I have written four major writing ,- page - word or more and am on my fifth. Last year, when I wa on my first major writing one of my friend asked me if she could read it. I wa hesitant because it is my soul. I take everything I feel and put it down on the page. It is all I do. i do not go out or have any kind of social life. Writing is my life. But, I eventually let her read it. She liked it and read that whole writing. Since then she ha become my editor of sorts. There is just one problem - she is not editing. You see, she is a drama geek - in play and everything - and doe not have a whole lot of free time so I understand a slow pace, but lately I have had to prod her to do anything. Even over Christmas break she did not do anything. Now, I have to call her on the weekend which is the only time she will even do it now to get her to do anything. If I do not she will forget she even ha it. Every time I ask her about it, she just tell me how busy she is and I end up feeling guilty. I feel like she is rejecting me a a person, like she is saying i just do not care about you. It hurt me so bad. It make me feel like the one thing keeping me alive is stupid. It make me want to kill myself. I feel like it is a burden to her. It hurt me so bad. It make me go home and cut myself. I have no idea how to handle the situation. I want her to do it, but I do not want it to seem like i am pestering her. I understand she is busy, but she make time to go out with her other friends. Could not she make a little time for me? Am I being unreasonable here? What should I do? Please help.",0.38164

Does anyone else is depression cause them to constantly daydream or imagine their life are a documentary? I daydream a lot about people I know in real life or situation I wish would happen. It is alternate reality I go to escape my loneliness. I sometimes daydream about being in a hotel in some tropical paradise or being in a very romantic date or just that I am in some kind of reality TV show documentary where I am the star and the narrator at the same time and everyone admires me. My mental state worsens once the daydreaming is over and I realize it is just fantasy.,0.332

"I wish people that have never experienced depression could still understand. There are those who might really care about you and want to help but they have zero clue how depression work and their mindset is basically to tell you to get over it because that is what they do. It is so fucking shit. I should be grateful I have people that care about me I know, but it genuinely not that helpful when they brush aside how shit I really feel because they do not see a reason for me to feel like this other than just being weak. It is not even their fault it is just actually uncomprehendable to some people that you would rather not exist sometimes for reason beyond your control.

I am year old and I still cry myself to sleep thinking about my mom and all the pain she is in. I think about how much of a failure I have become and I wish I had never existed.

"Getting motivated to get help I wa diagnosed with a mood disorder and PTSD . year ago. I wa getting help for a while but I dropped out of school and moved out of state so I just have not been able to do that in the past year. I live with and mooch off of an SO but I have been fairly isolated for about months. I have been doing online school but had to drop my class this semester when I started working. Now all I do is this stupid part-time job. I should probably quit because it make me incredibly suicidal. It is all so superficial. It doe not feel beneath me but I really just do not mesh with it. Anyway. Health insurance. I cannot figure out how to fill out the income stuff. A hospital near me ha people that can help but I just cannot find the motivation to even call them. It is like I am trying to prevent myself from getting help. It is not even just psychiatric reason that I want health insurance. I have a referral for a neurologist. I have been having memory issues, twitches, etc. I know I will not go without insurance. I probably could stand to get on birth control and check out some other persistent problem too but a I know I will not be taken seriously and b the only thing I genuinely like about myself is my mind so that is the priority. I am not completely not trying. I will take St. John is Wort if I am persistently suicidal but it doe not help with motivation. I have been going to support groups. I will decide to be motivated but end up collapsed and sobbing before I get out of the door. Play music, leave my phone behind so I do not get sidetracked. Tell people what I am doing so I feel pressured to keep my word. Incentivize with promise of fast food, caffeine, or chocolate. I dunno what else to do. I cannot even tell if it is laziness or depression or something else. The only thing that motivates me to go to work is fear which is also the main thing that prevents me from quitting.",0.3236

"A Letter to My Future Self Self Love Dear future B, This letter may be fragmented. This letter may be short, or it may be long. This letter may be emotional. Most importantly, this letter is to show you that you can stay grounded despite the rush of emotion you experience when you feel vulnerable and falsely unloved. Everything you thought you knew since that day October st ha become unraveled within the last fourteen hours. It is hard to find the word that can sum it all up in order to save some time and space within this letter. This letter is also not about those specific event but about you and only you, and how far you have come it all play into being able to deal with whatever the future may bring. As you admitted this morning, to yourself and G, your sense of clarity evaporates when you begin to feel vulnerable. It lead you to a self-fulfilling prophecy - the exact neediness you exhibit will do the exact opposite of what you would like it to do and will therefore lead you to feeling ever more needy. Listen to me You are not validated by someone is ability or lack thereof to love you. And again Sometimes, it is not simply not about you. So far in your healing process you have managed to understand the importance of detachment. You are making wonderful progress and I hope that at some point you are still progressing. Your existence is for you and for you only. It is not okay or healthy to live solely for another human being. Remember that you are not incomplete without someone however that someone can enhance the you that you already are. A relationship consists of two people working together a a whole yet existing a their own sense of wholeness outside of the relationship. That is so very important for you to remember for the rest of your life. Remember when you felt vulnerable just a few week ago sometime in November and wanted to dive into texting that boy in order to make you feel better about yourself? And then remember that you did not because you kept your clarity and understood that it wa a coping mechanism. Do not forget that you have done that not only once but a few time now and that is exceptional. I understand future Bri may encounter some setback and that her well-being might a well be a roulette wheel, but that is exactly what this letter is for. As you have been told, you are luminous. You shine bright. Your heart is almost too huge. You have the potential to do great things. You are not your illness and you are not your insecurities. The grave you will lay in one day will only consist of you and nobody else. If the world end and you survive, you have yourself. You have to keep this mind every single day. Work on self love and understand your worth. Yes, G make you feel like the most important girl in the world. But before you can let him do that, you need to understand that you are the most important girl in the world to yourself, for yourself. You are done putting your interest aside just to receive love for the night day. You are done with getting angry at the phone for not getting response quickly. You are done feeling unimportant or unloved because you are not someone is first priority. In the month and a half since the breakup, you have transformed. It is only the beginning but you have taken step in the right direction. Future B need to look back on this whether she is in a good spot at the time or not. She need to know that even though she may not be at a point in life she envisioned, she did something for herself. When you feel like he is pulling away, do not push harder. When you feel like you want to run to him in order to silence your overwhelmingly surfacing insecurities, understand that will not make thing better. Understand that they are amplified and you are only expressing coping mechanism in order to deal with the underlying issue. The issue is not that he doe not love you but that you make yourself unloveable. Understand that when you get into that mindset and lose grasp of the clarity, someone moving mountain for you will not fill that hole of pain. The only person on the face of this Earth that can fill that hole is you. You have the capability of moving mountain on your own when you remember these things. Continue doing your research. Continue taking time for yourself. Continue setting your phone down for hour at a time. Continue living your life out and letting others play a part and not the center role. You are the star of your life, you lead the show. Your family, friends, boyfriend, colleague - they play their role in your story. Most importantly, they play their lead role in their own story and similarly you are character. Learn to appreciate silence. Learn to appreciate a bit of loneliness and solitude. Self-love includes coming home from work to take a hot bath and drink a glass of red wine, not rushing over to whoevers house in order to feel loved by someone else. You cannot be loved appropriately if you cannot love yourself first. Is not it just like me to start taking the advice I have been given by so many people my entire life. Love yourself. Respect yourself. Appreciate your own time. Respect others. Respect other is need for space. Live for you. Again, love yourself. With love, B, .",0.2516
"I kinda like being depressed after dealing with anxiety As a lot of people, I have both depression and anxiety disorders. Basically a thing happened in July, which caused me to have constant panic attack and overall brutal anxiety until around October, when I just transitioned into deep depression. It wa however a big relief. I wa completely empty, I did not care about anything. It wa x better to me than fucking anxiety. When I am depressed, I do not feel bad . I do not feel good either, but I am fine with that. I do not feel anything, it is kinda relaxing. The downside - when I wa in the deepest state of depression I wa really close to killing myself and I also threatened to shoot up the school, after which police took me to a mental hospital. I have been here for over month now. I did some really bad things, I acted really bad, but on the inside I felt better. When I am anxious I do not do mean thing to people, but on the inside I am dying, I feel vulnerable and just want help. I understand that depression is awful and people suffer from it, I see what it doe to people on this sub. I just wanted to add my experience, since it is different to everyone else is. Anxiety make me feel like I am having a heart attack, like I am going crazy, I sweat, I shake, it feel literally like torture. Depression is the exact opposite. It is calmness, not giving a shit about anything, basically relaxing. I feel kinda comfortable being depressed. I lie on the bed and look at the ceiling, at the wall, whatever. Like I am on autopilot. Right now I have both, which just feel fucking weird, I cannot even describe that. Sorry if I offended anyone. I know some people prefer to feel something, but I am fine with being an empty shell. tlr - depression gt anxiety for me.",0.40746

I have struggled with depression for about year now and I have had my high and my lows. Recently I have been doing okay even though me and my girlfriend mutually broke up, but we are still friend and she support me. And my birthday is coming up soon so I wa looking forward to that. Today though I decided to go to subway to get a melt and I wa just standing in line when this girl walk away from her friend and up to me. I thought she wa pretty and wa nervous about why she wa talking to me until she asked Are you a serial killer? That is when my heart sank. I had just shaved and I realize I am not the best looking guy in the world, but I did not know that is how stranger perceived me. I kept a calm demeanor until I got back to my car and I just complete broke down and I wa bawling all the way home. I do not know why it hurt so much, but I felt like complete shit. I am trying to not let it affect me and not hit a low point so I hope sharing this relief me a little bit. I am nervous about sharing this though. I am just shocked that someone could say that.

"Hello, I am Yevgenny, year old, and have suffered from depression for..well..I guess a long a I can remember. I started having suicidal thought when I wa , but strangely enough, I cannot remember having at that age any concept of suicide. I have been placed on practically all of the antidepressant over the year with the exception of MAOIs , and am currently taking Cymbalta--no real side effects, seems effective enough. My father died when I wa , but that in itself wa not so sad. Last September, I had a sudden thought regarding my feeling about his death, and I found the most heartbreaking aspect was, like I said, not the fact that he died, but that the process of dying wa for him degrading and humiliating. Like me, he wa very independent--if he needed help with something, he considered himself defeated he wa content in his own world, like I am, but the magnitude of something like death forced people into his world..those intangible connection between ourselves and others, between him and others, seemed to chain him down. When I had my last breakdown in September, I could not stop myself from imagining it to find yourself suddenly and wholly dependent on others, and for them to force themselves into your mind, your world, and find for themselves some memory or happy relic to take with them such that even your most private, perhaps sacred thought and memory are wrenched from you. I thought about what it must have been like to know with certainty that death wa all that wa left, the helplessness of not being able to face your own future without someone either doing it for you or having earlier robbed you of the existential will power to do it. I attempted to hang myself after my morning classes. I am not sure how, but before kicking the chair away, I forced myself to call someone because the world is so huge, and I have only had the chance to see such a small part of it, to die then, would have been so meaningless and empty--the very thing I wa attempting to escape, meaninglessness and emptiness. The friend I called left work immediately and came to me. She cried in one afternoon more than I ever have, and she wa not even the depressed one. So, fast forward to today. Did some inpatient care. I am seeing a therapist whom I trust, respect, and have thus far been unable to outwit it is a good thing. On a physiological basis, the medication is helping. Psychologically however, I have got some work to do. Ignoring biological chemical factors, in order for me to be happy, I need to find build understand the meaning of my life. I do not believe that man is born with an inherent raison d etre, or that one is given to him by some divine entity rather, I believe that the meaning of one is life is self-constructed and in continual flux, it is something you work on, something you subsist upon, and yet is something that is always just out of reach, or one brush stroke undone. Not an easy job. But last week I wa on my front porch at around pm having a cigarette I am keeping this habit for now. Everything wa still, the air still cold with winter but with trace of spring on every tree, the cloud were lit from below and the west, it wa like a painting but it wa this oddly static scene that gave me the most lucid understanding of myself, that unstoppable, dynamic thing we call self. And so, more than ever before, I am going to take treatment seriously and honestly even if there is sadness, those chance moment of serenity that make up for in intensity what they lack in length, in those instance I think I will find meaning, no, I already have, I suppose. I apologize for how lengthy this became, but I am guessing it wa somehow necessary for me to say. I am looking forward to talking with the other member of the forum, a I do not think I have ever talked to others who were depressed. Even if I do not find much help here, there might be someone who find such help in me. Thanks! And, again, I will try to keep future post shorter, but in my defense, sometimes when I write I do not feel in control..oh, starting to go off again. Ok, I am going to stop now.",0.26964

"I do not feel well. Hey, I am a highschool freshman and this ha been the lowest I have ever been from the past three year of feeling like I should be gone. Buckle up your seatbelt because this will probably be pretty long. Since the beginning of this year, I have been wanting to die I feel so lonely and a if nobody actually care about me. So, there is my primary friendship group the people I hang out with the most. All of my genuine female friend pretty much do not give two shit about me because I tend to act really clingy to them and other people because I have been friend with them since first grade and do not want to lose them. One of my female friend is kinda popular and she barely talk to me, and I just feel like I am undeserving of her time or something she is also kinda claimed my other female friend, so I do not get a much time to hang out with them a I used to. My guy friend are also a bit popular and they also happen to be dating my two female friend lol. They do make me feel happy talking to them, and I do hang out with them a lot, but sometimes I feel like I should not be hanging out with them all that much because then I am stealing them from my friends. I also get pretty bummed not being in a relationship when my other friend are, and I do feel like I am not needed amongst any of my friends. Basically, I just feel like the rebound when one of my friend are not there . Can we actually talk about one of my female friend a bit more, actually? We will call her M and my other female friend B. We met M last year and we invited her to hang out with u during our lunches. M wa going through a tough time and we helped her out all the time and it wa great making a new really close friend. She wa really fun to talk to, but I do not know..sometimes she say some shit to me that make me kinda bummed. I remember telling her how I felt kinda depressed once, and she said something along the line of Stop asking for attention and actually do something . Another time, I wa hanging out with B is boyfriend, but the next day, M wa mad at me and told me I should not take him from B which I do get and feel bad for, but B is totally cool with it and understands how me and her boyfriend hang out Recently, I do not remember what initiated the conversation really M and I were talking which rarely happens anymore , and she wa talking about how she feel like she doe not have anyone that actually care for her, when she ha so many people that clearly do care about her and love her. Then she proceeds to tell me to actually go and make friend again. I hate being petty and talking about other people, but I just do not feel comfortable being very close to her anymore and I am not sure she is interested in talking to me either. So then that leaf like two male friends, and again because they are in relationship with B and M, I am trying to pace myself with hanging out with them so one of them do not get upset. It is also pretty hard to make friend in a school where most people are white and really attractive, or already have their place. I am a non-attractive Asian female that tends to make weird joke and seem really masculine with the way that I mainly put forward, and I just do not fit in anywhere. I have a lot of anxiety of what people think of me, so then I sometimes struggle with talking to people. I would not say people dislike me at all, it is just that nobody would hang out with me outside of school and it is hard to find people that are willing to spend time with me. There is also the problem with others expectation of me Almost all my life, I have been deemed smart , which ha caused so much pressure and anxiety throughout the years. My parent really want me to do well in school, and peer think I am so great at everything. I thought it would go away after elementary school, but even here, people consider me being so smart and able to do anything. With currently a average in my classes, it is extremely difficult to maintain that and I feel like if I do any worse, someone is going to get mad at me. People expect me and think I am so good, but really I am just average at literally everything I do. I also have no idea what I want to do with my life. I am not very good at anything, and I have so many interests, it is hard to pin down something that I should do with my time. Nothing really interest me enough to do it for like year of my life, and the thing I would be interested in have literally no way of making a living off of or is something totally unachievable. I feel like I cannot make any difference to anyone in the world, and I will die not making an impression on anyone or having anyone really care about me in the end. I have been hurting myself since about third grade, mostly from scratching myself with my nail until it leaf a mark for a few day and hitting myself on the back of the head. It is extremely satisfying and I feel like it is a good thing to punish myself for being such a waste. So that is pretty much the gist of it, I guess? Mostly just problem with self worth and having others view me a certain way. There is some other stuff, but nothing that I can really think of at the top of my head. These past month have been excruciating, and I have not gone a day without thinking I should just end it all and give up. I want to be happy, but that just seems so far away and I do not know if me living benefit anyone. Admittedly, I do not want to die, but I do at the same time? I feel like I have no place in the world and I cannot talk to anyone about how I am feeling because none of them are actually willing to hear what I have to say, so now I am just dumping my feeling on Reddit. I am tired of living and feeling like shit. I do not remember the last time I genuinely felt happy to be alive. I want someone I am close to tell me that they love me and care about me and say I am not a useless piece of garbage and that what I say is not meaningless or invalid. I do not want to feel alone. I do not ask to feel alone. I feel alone because I am alone, and I feel like I cannot tell anyone this because I do not want them to walk out of my life. I am sorry if this seemed really petty and like I am just bitching about some shitty first world problems, because I know I am. I just feel kinda down right now and I have not been able to tell someone how I actually feel in months. So yeah. Thanks for reading, stranger. Sorry for the inconvenient text wall.",0.0

"Does anyone else miss the person they used to be? I have always struggled with depression, but sometimes it is more manageable than other times. I have noticed that with every new year and myself getting older, I begin to look back on my past and long for it, even sometimes breaking down because I miss the person I used to be. I am , so still young, but I really wish I could go back and be again because that wa when I wa truly happy. I had moved out of my hometown, had lot of friends, a good relationship, I lost ton of weight and wa confident for the first time ever, I traveled and worked for fun instead of working a a mean of survival. I loved life, I had so much energy and such a bright outlook on everything and I had a lot of fun. Now, that is all over. I really only have one good friend left from those time and he doe not even live near me anymore sometimes I get really down when I think about old friend and start thinking about thing I could have said differently that might have prevented the argument we had that would eventually lead to the end of our friendship, I really never knew how much I needed them until they no longer wanted me in their lives. My relationship fizzled out in the same way and I have yet to develop a connection like that with anyone again. I have also gained all my weight back and cannot stand to look at my own reflection. I do not know how to be happy like I wa again. I look at old picture from time past with old friends, destination I went too and I want to cry because I just wish I could go back. I am so depressed and hate myself, I am incredibly lonely and am just a shell of the person I used to be. It is like I am mourning my past life or something.",0.09429
"I made a word cloud of all my depressive post over the past three years. This is based on all the post on my throwaway account this is my main account and ha too many unrelated post to sort through since . I think it is noteworthy that some of the biggest word in the cloud are negative. While going back over these post from so relatively long ago, I noticed that most of the older one seemed like they were written by a total stranger. If it were somebody else saying those thing about me, it would be called harassment, but it wa me saying those thing about myself. All in all, this ha really made me realize that all the thing I have written about myself are way off-base, and are only true in my mind during a depressive episode. I know something is wrong, but I do not know what to do about it. In some way I am sure I will always think this way about myself, regardless of what I do, but I wish there were an easy way to manage it. I used this word cloud generator. Cheers.",1.0

"What is the point in living? Obviously with the title you would think I am sad and hate myself or am severely suicidal. In reality, there is truth to that, but I seriously do not see a point in living. I have tried different thing to try and discover myself like spending dollar on camera equipment thinking maybe photography is my calling only to return it the next week. I have bought a jeep thinking maybe overlanding or off-roading is my thing and now I am in the process of selling it. I have friend that I hang out with once a month. I have real life friend that I text occasionally. I have not had a girlfriend in several year now. Mind you I turn year old tomorrow. I do not know what the next step in my life is? Who am I? Is there something more to me than just working then going home just to sleep all day? I have had a small problem with taking pain killer like oxy, vicodin, and codeine. I just do not find any joy in any part of my life. I do not want to die, but at the same time I would not mind not waking up tomorrow. I just want a passion. Something to live for. I do not want to be like this, but I have tried different thing all my life and I have lost all joy. Is there a way to discover myself? Is that even an actual thing? What am I missing in my life? I just want to look forward to living another day rather than dreading it. To clarify, I do not consider myself suicidal. I do not WANT to die. I WANT a reason to be alive.",0.21920000000000006
"I cannot seem to be happy with my current life - only the future So I wa diagnosed with mood swing mild depression quite a while ago, and have been on a small dose of Fluoxetine Prozac most of my life now. Based on looking at objective measures, I should be feeling pretty content right now, but I cannot seem to be happy about it, and only about the thing that I hope I will work towards in the future. I guess for example - I have lost a little over pound since February, the first significant time I have actually lost weight, and I am now no longer medically obese.. but I still just feel fat and have not been able to feel anything good about the weight I have actually lost. I have a great job, and am just about to finish paying off all my loans, but I do not feel any accomplishment in that either. I keep thinking maybe I will feel good when I have enough to put down a down-payment on a house, but I doubt that will be the case. I have a bunch of great friends, but I am tired of being single again. I know that I should just focus on the good thing right now, but it is not seeming to be any consolation. My faith life ha been doing pretty good recently too, especially compared to the past, but I still feel like a shitty person a lot.

"Psychiatrist of year terminated me a a patient and is refusing refill of Lamictal because I went to outpatient rehab? I have been going to the same psychiatrist for years. I have been on a high dose of Lamictal for year to treat bipolar disorder. I have gone to regular appointment and have had consistent refills. I had a period of intense depression in which I went on a one month drinking binge and went to a hospital where I wa given Ativan to deal with the withdrawal. It wa not a consistent prescription, just enough pill to ween off the withdrawal and ensure I would not relapse back to drinking. My psychiatrist just called me and told me she is terminating me a a patient and is unable to see me or refill my lamictal because I wa prescribed Ativan by another physician. I am freaking out about the effect of stopping this cold turkey. I only took the Ativan for one week, two month ago. I just want to have my lamictal refilled.

"Hi all, I am in hell of major depression. After being for over year on Elavil and Valium small dosage , with good result for most of the time, I tapered down because of the side effect and have been drug free for year. During this year the depression slowly settled in making my life unbearable lately. I do not know what to do. I saw psychiatrist within last month. One of them wanted me on Paxil and the second one on Effexor. Problem is I am so afraid of side effect that I cannot begin taking any of them, meantime my life is falling to pieces. My nervous system wa completely messed up by these medicines. I had severe fasciculation of muscle for over month after being medicine free sign of tardive dyskinesia, untreatable neurological condition and get them back whenever I try any supplement that would increase serotonin level SAMe, St. John is Wort, Rhodiola . My memory got better after I stopped the medication but now it is falling apart because of the depression I get de-realized I mean if depression will not kill me these medicine will. What are my alternative if any ? Shall I take these medicines, for the time being, endure side effect and expose myself to degenerative damage? Shall I stay away from medicine and get incapacitated by depression? Is there any alternative treatment for major depression? I would appreciate any advice. Dania",0.44318
"I do not wanna die, but I ai not keen on livin either. Sorry for the Robbie lyric. I just want to vocalize a bit before the rare fancy pass and I go back to soldiering on alone. I am sorry if this ramble or doe not quite make sense, but if I leave the stream of consciousness or reread I will probably delete because I loathe the idea of complaining to others or whinging knowing full well I have probably got it better than most people here. But a part of me want to know that someone else experience depression the same way, a some small solace. I am never particularly sad, nor do I hate or wish harm upon myself or my life or the people in it. However, in every waking moment I have a weight emanating from my core, like a gravitational pull sucking in my ability to want anything meaningful. The best way I can put it is in the title - I simply do not want to be . And that is not because I am overwhelmed by hardship or struggle, I have got it pretty good and there is nowhere I would rather be. If, hypothetically, you took me back to before my birth and laid out an incredible life for me and said alright, you are about to be born, ready to go? I would say no thanks, I am good . With a core belief like that there is no life to live. Career advancement serf no purpose but to consume more time, and I would be taking a good job from someone who actually get some personal value out of it. Romance is off the card because someone who want to date someone who doe not want anything from life, probably also is not worth being with. And heaven forbid someone should want kids! Hey Junior, daddy doe not like his existence but he had you anyway, what an asshole. I should stop before I become some combination of old man yell at cloud and whiny emo stereotype .

I will wake up one day and and have absolutely no desire to be healthy anymore and slip right back into feeling like shit and hating myself because I cannot commit to the simplest of things.

Nobody could ever convince me that it is not. This past bought of motivation, I tried to convince myself that I wa going to exercise and eat right for the sake of my health, but in the back of my mind, I knew the only real reason wa because I wanted to lose weight. And now here I am, completely abandoned diet and exercise and right back into the throw of depression. All I want to do anymore is lay in bed and try to fall asleep.
