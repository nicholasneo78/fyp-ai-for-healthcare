Just another night. Another night of feeling lonely and just wondering what I did wrong in life to deserve this unhappiness. I’ve never felt a pain stronger than being rejected by the love of your life. The person who gives you a purpose. The person who is supposed to make everything better. You would give your life for this person and they just don’t love you anywhere near the same. ,just night night feeling lonely just wondering did wrong life deserve unhappiness felt pain stronger rejected love life person give purpose person supposed make better life person just not love near same,0.5015683174133301,0.42232128977775574,0.49866577982902527
"Is it possible to fake depression? I have been feeling bad for about 7 months now. There are periods where I cry on a daily basis, I never feel like talking, I struggle concentrating and collecting thoughts, I feel such an extreme sadness inside of me also in happy situations, I am exhausted all the time even if I sleep 10 hours straight, I often have headaches, I am completely alone and I find it difficult to do anything. There are nights where it’s unbearable. I think about my situation: I am completely alone, I am failing at anything because I am so weak I can’t handle my feelings, I feel guilt for everything that happens around me, I can’t carry on anymore, I am always here in this dark place and I feel that I have no right to be like this. I used to self harm and I still have many scars on my skin, but I think to be disrespectful to those who truly struggle then I promised to cut never again. I shouldn’t have the right to do so. My life is void, I am void, and I can’t get the energy to do anything ever. I do not get pleasure from what I used to love, nothing seems to make me feel something good. I can enjoy no series, no book, no videogame like I used to. I think I don’t even deserve to eat. I am just trying to pity myself giving myself depression, but I don’t have it.

"Best moment to have anxiety It's 3:30am, I'm tired, want to get up early, and guess what ? My brain decided this : Instead of sleeping, why don't you become half crazy, thinking about your future (should I say the ""lack"" of future ?). Here, have some cravings for cigarettes, my pleasure, and of course i know you don't have cigarettes, do you think I'm stupid ? The middle of the night is the best moment for thinking of smoking when you can't smoke.  Think of your loneliness. Think of you inexistant social life. You are 25 and you have no job. You are living with your boring mother, with whom you literally quarel with every day. She probably think you are a piece of shit. You never had any girlfriend, and you probably won't. Almost 26, don't count on me to congratulate you...  Your only sunbeam will be at New year's Eve, when you will travel to see your best friends. But guess what, since you have no money at all, you probably will have to work to sell fu***ng pastries, and because of that you won't be able to see your friends.  Then you'll continue to argue with your mother. Living on the couch. Selling pastries. In entire loneliness. God only knows how long.  The funny thing (say my brain) is this : ""you are a loser, you lived and worked on your own not so long ago. But you are a child, you have the power to do what you want, where you want. You're 25, for God's sake, so why don't you move your ass ?""  Leave me alone brain, I already know all that. I would be a king if I could. But I won't. Funny how despair can suck the marrow of your life, how even when you are ready to fall in the deepest pit, you have absolutely no will to catch the rope.  TL ; DR : FML.

"I was just curious what your feelings are on long-term outcomes for depression. A little background for me: I've been on and off medicines for several years. I was always depressed as a child, but didn't really seek professional help until maybe 10 years ago. I originally went on medicines. for severe pms prescribed to me by my ob-gyn. I just kind of continued on with it because it made me feel ""leveled out"". Then I had issues with sleep apnea, joint pains etc. My neurologist put me on Effexor. Every time I tried to go off that drug I was dizzy and had bad side effects. Finally, I reduced the dose myself and weaned myself off the Effexor. I had gained a tremendous amount of weight. I was off all medicines for 8 months and then I really feel into a dark depression. It was then that I sought a therapist, etc. I have been on medicines ever since...since June of 2004. I had lost 40 pounds by going off the medicines, but then became depressed again. following several deaths and major life events. I was put on Lexapro and gained weight. Not wanting to gain weight again, I hated being on the medicines. He kept saying it will stabilize. I told him that the weight gain was making me more depressed. Finally, he changed my medicines to Wellbutrin. We talked about trying to go off medicines when life events settled down...my main reason to go off was the weight gain. Immediately the weight came back off. That was a year ago. Now a year later, I am still losing about a pound or two a month. The last time I went in, he didn't say anything about going off the medicines. How long do people take medicines? Is it just better to stay on them and not fall back into the hole? Are there any long-term use side effects to be concerned with? Is this something I will probably be on forever? It just seems like I will always be like this. It just seems like depression is always just standing back in the shadows. I go for a very long time and feel fine and then I have a week where I get very down and know that if I wasn't on medicines. it would be very bad. I haven't gone to talk to my therapist in a long while. When I am having these bouts of depression, should I call and say I need to go in for a ""check-up"". I don't really have any specific issues to discuss. The big thing right now is I just feel down because I have lost my closest friends and don't feel like I have any friends to do anything with. I feel so isolated. Would it be good to just call and go in? I just feel stupid saying I feel sad because I don't have any friends. Are there any good books that you can recommend on self-help--esp. negative thinking, understanding why I think the way I do, etc. I found Dr. Phil's book on Life Strategies to be very helpful in discovering that there are reasons why I do things and think.",just curious feeling longterm outcome depression little background me medicine year depressed child did not really seek professional help maybe year ago originally went medicine severe pm prescribed obgyn just kind continued feel leveled out issue sleep apnea joint pain etc neurologist effexor time tried drug dizzy bad effect finally reduced dose weaned effexor gained tremendous weight medicine month really feel dark depression sought therapist etc medicine sincesince june lost pound going medicine depressed again following death major life event lexapro gained weight not wanting gain weight again hated medicine kept saying stabilize told weight gain making depressed finally changed medicine wellbutrin talked trying medicine life event settled downmy main reason weight gain immediately weight came off year ago year later losing pound month time went in did not say going medicine long people medicine just better stay not fall hole longterm use effect concerned with probably forever just like like this just like depression just standing shadow long time feel fine week know not medicine bad not gone talk therapist long while having bout depression say need checkup not really specific issue discus big thing right just feel lost closest friend not feel like friend with feel isolated good just in just feel stupid saying feel sad not friend good book recommend selfhelpesp negative thinking understanding think way do etc dr phil book life strategy helpful discovering reason thing think,0.5278440117835999,0.4051368832588196,0.49002590775489807

"Hello out there.... Ugh. I battle with depression, anxiety, bulimia, OCPD, BPD, and some physical health issues. Not so sure about battle right now. Maybe more like grudgingly coexist with?   I'm 42. I've never held a job with the same company for longer than 3 years, and that was just once. A few times (I think) I've made it to the 2 year mark with a company. 1 year is a bit easier. I had to quit my last job because it was too easy to use the job to fuel the eating disorder. (I lost 40% of my starting weight in about 7 months, before I switched phases and ended up with a pulmonary embolism from refeeding syndrome.) Right now I'm in the initial hurry up and deny me so I can get an attorney phase of applying for disability. Thankfully I have a sister who is letting me live in her house, so at least I'm not homeless. (TBH, most of the time she's out of the country, and when she is here, she's just as selectively social as I am.) Because of waiting to get on disability, I'm off my medicine. I can't even afford the cheapest ACA insurance, and even if I had that, I couldn't afford the copays for my medicine. I'm not eligible for Medicaid in my state until I get approved for SSI/SSDI.   I'm not too worried about not having my antidepressants right now tho. This is probably the most pleasant major depressive episode I've ever had. It's not so much feeling horrible psychic pain as it's just been a gentle bleeding out of the vibrancy of life. I sleep as late as I can every day, (usually until around 1 or so), hang out in bed playing games, reading, or watching videos, and only really waking up and being willing to be awake around 7 in the evening.   I don't feel like I'm living anymore. I'm just in a holding pattern. I think back to what my life was like, even 8 months ago, and I mourn for it. At least I'm not suicidal. I think I just need a place where I can come every so often and unload my mind.

I was going to lurk for a bit before I posted, but there's so many of us, (I mean, I knew. but I didn't know.. you know? :) it seems like the thing to do. I'm a 24 year old male and I've had problems with depression for as long as I can remember, though it's become worse over the last year or so. I was pretty heavily involved in music and martial arts for years, but I'm no longer motivated to do either. I'm still going to school, though I have no real direction and I'm afraid that my lack of motivation is going to cause me to screw that up too.  I started having anxiety attacks about a year ago and they've increased in frequency the last few months. They're (not to sound melodramatic) the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with. If I'm in panic-attack mode, any slight pain or discomfort quickly becomes a life-threatening illness that is surely going to kill me in the next few minutes. As ridiculous as that sounds, it's absolutely real when it's happening and I live in almost constant fear it's going to happen again. I have a hard time even driving anymore (especially on the freeway) and increasingly rely on my girlfriend for menial things like going to the store. She is very supportive and is aware that something is wrong, though I don't think she understands to what extent. I've started completely avoiding any situation in which I have to meet new people and have a hard time even talking to people I don't know on the phone. These symptoms have been increasing in intensity over the last 6 months or so and exponentially for the last 3 weeks (I just lost my job). It seems like quite a few of you have been dealing with these sorts of things for much longer and I'm sorry if my posting here so soon seems insensitive, but its already getting to the point where I know I can't handle living like this for years on end. I've suffered from depression for (relative to my age) a long time and the anxiety attacks are absolutely terrifying (a little redundant, I know). It feels like the last year is the beginning of everything completely falling apart. I guess my posting here is a way to get the ball rolling towards getting some help. I don't have health insurance anymore and I'm not sure where to go from here. I've been medicated in the past, but I haven't taken anything in a few years. Though, without insurance I'm not even sure that's an option. That's enough for now. Thanks for providing a resource like this.

"An Open Letter Dear you,  It's been three years since we decided to go our separate ways. We both had different goals, desires and aspirations. We were perfect together, but just at the wrong time.

In the end, you found somebody new, which is fine. I chose, whether consciously or unconsciously to stay on a different path. I've tried new women. Many beautiful on the outside, but they aren't you. Oh no, no, no. They all don't have what you had.   Not even close.  Maybe one day I will end this crusade against myself, against the past. I can't change it, I can't alter the story, I can't lie to myself.  I wish I could tell you I'm sorry. But it wouldn't change anything. For you it's a battle that was fought long ago.

I came out of the closet the summer going into my freshman year of high school, dealt with a (simply put) shitty childhood while growing up in the Bible Belt of northern Florida, with an abusive father and worrying, even at the age of 7/8 about how my future would play out in this. My mom divorced and remarried a man that doesn’t accept my sexuality personally but supports my life decision  and says he loves me. We moved to Montana (my mom, me and him) and I began to feel like I did have a purpose when I was introduced to acting onstage at a local theatre that I fell in love with. Life, for a few years, was amazing but my high school at the time was having a crisis. Unfortunately four students had committed suicide between my freshman and junior year and, with the help of many, started a suicide awareness program in the city and lead that for a year or so. My senior year, literally three days before it started, my military brother committed suicide on base, it was suspected it was also his sexuality. But also in my senior year, near the end of it, I met a man whom I fell in love with (which is what I am getting too, just bare with me). We were able to spend a lot of time together for a month or two before he had to leave to Portland (before I had gone) for a work internship where he would go back home to Brazil once completed. He treats me like gold, and I really mean that, he has been nothing but amazing to me. He flew me out to Portland so I could visit him for two weeks where we fell even more in love. Everything was shattered when he left for home and I also left for an adventure.   After I graduated, I had the amazing opportunity to go to the BEAUTIFUL island of Taiwan, where I spent an amazing year learning Chinese (Mandarin), meeting people all around the world, experiencing a new culture for the first time, it was indeed a life changing time for me. But it wasn’t easy for my boyfriend and I. We fought in occasion, texting makes it really hard to communicate emotions, and we only had about two hours out of our days to talk due to the harsh time zone differences. The year went by quite quickly and he surprised me with yet another plane ticket to Portland where he would also land only two hours after I did and we would be together again. It was only for two weeks again but I felt complete... He even proposed on the Fourth of July. He was yanked away from me again soon after and it tore me down. My heart crumbled.  My next chapter in life had started once I arrived back from Taiwan and had seen my boyfriend again. I had decided I wanted to move to a Portland permanently, found a decent student housing apartment, enrolled for school, I was excited... now this is where things become a bit much for me and why I’m here today.   My, now fiancé, was able to stay with me for a full month this time. Now at this point I’m sure you wonder (if you are still reading), “why doesn’t he move here?,” or “why don’t you move there?”  Here’s why: He was on an exchange program when I met him that the Brazilian government paid for. The requirement for that visa is that he must stay in Brazil for two years before he can legally move back into the USA. In other words, he is stuck there while I’m stuck here both separated and both in fear of him being rejected. We applied for the fiancé visa and now we are waiting for the approval. I refuse to move where he lives because of how high the crime rate is and due to Brazil’s economic status, we both agreed it would not be good for a white American target to live in a high crime area.   I know I have talked a lot about my fiancé but here is also what is going on on my hands as well that I just was not ready for. Before I moved to Portland, I had to go to urgent care because I had no primary doctor and no money, only Medicaid, which they took. I went three times for small bumps on my hands that turned out to be stressed induced and all three times I went the doctors said “I have no idea! Try using lotions and see what happens!” Nodded their heads and left. Very pointless but when I got the bill I was shocked and confused. I thought my Medicaid had covered it, which it did not because while I was out of country my Medicaid had expired and no one told me about it, therefore I was left with a $600 bill. I heard it off for a while because I had other things to deal with than the bullshit that the hospital was giving me about it. Around this time as well, I moved in with my best friend due to a dispute I had with my parents, which really crumbled me, but they still don’t know how upset I am about it.   I moved to Portland... and now I believe I’m regretting it...   I moved with that same best friend where we would also share the space with two others, a couple from Hawaii. We had Skyped then ahead of time in our excitement of moving and we were all excited to meet each other. I had a job lined up for me as a barista, I had a savings plan lined up for what I could and couldn’t spend for money, school would be starting soon, things were looking pretty nice!   Well... it’s not nice. Not nice at all.   The Hawaiian couple does not like my friend and I. They stop our oven mittens and tried to say they were there’s and hid them from us, refused to let us use the garbage can in the kitchen, and held little meetings about what it is we were doing wrong and how we could fix it.. I was so thrown back I ignore them at any chance and even had to take time out of my life to tell them how upsetting it is we had reached a level where they had to actually put sticky notes on things we could touch and could not touch. I find myself to be quite tidy and clean and fair but I guess there are two sides of the story always.   That’s the first thing.   That job I had lined up as a barista? Big joke... I met with the boss who said the store isn’t open yet and asked if I wanted to be a cashier for the university instead. I said why not, the pay was amazing at $12.75 an hour and had benefits. I did my on-boarding and was quite interested. First day on the job however they lied and put me in food service where I was demanded around by two chefs and four managers who didn’t know what the fuck they were doing. One of the chef’s actually spilt boiling grease on my foot and didn’t even apologize. The other chef was racist and talked bad about the Indian workers so much I had to leave his presence. It was a toxic environment. Income tax in Oregon was so high I wasn’t able to afford my apartment and realized I need to be working minimum wage to sincerely support myself here. I left after a month and am now struggling on finding a full time again. On a side note, because of costs and issues with finding a co-signed for a loan, I had to pull my enrollment for school as well.  That’s the second..   When my fiancé came to visit me for a month, my best friend/roommate was very difficult... it’s a harsh word to use but she has a lot of learning to do. I have been on my own since I was 16 in doing things myself (with the exception of paying my phone bill and buying a car). Taxes, jobs, appointments, etc., were all me. She needs some help getting there and she has done and amazing job to get there but... every opportunity I hand her to take one more step of becoming independent she rejects and shuts down completely. The whole month was very hard for my fiancé and I over how jealous and upset she got and it was too much. Currently she is back home for Christmas and I am alone and quite frankly I needed it. I just don’t know how to handle that situation. It was as if she was using her emotions against me and it was poisonous. It go so bad my fiancé and Igor an Airbnb our last two nights together so it could just be me and him.   That’s the third..  I had to go to the emergency room as well when my fiancé was here due to yet another kidney stone. I got one in the 7th grade, near the end of my exchange program and one in a restaurant where the pain was so bad I needed to call an ambulance... more money on shit I can’t afford.   I can go on and on with these stories but I need to get to this... it’s my anxiety. I was diagnosed with depression in high school but was taken off of medication. I was doing actually quite well! But most recently, with everything that’s been going on, it’s gotten really really bad. I am constantly anxed about everything.. when I walk down the street, I fear what people look at me as. Now I’m not fat, I’d say I’m average but my cheeks are so puffy and it really embarrasses me to even look in a mirror. I am constantly wondering why my fiancé wants to be with me, if he is cheating on me, lied to me, etc. I over stress about the smallest smallest things. Example: I cried and broke down because I failed my drivers test for the Oregon license. I physically felt like I was going to die or the end of the world was happening... why? Why was that happening to me? Why is this ALL happening to me? I miss my fiancé, I can’t get stable, I now starting out as an adult isn’t supposed to be easy but guys... this is really hard. I spend any day I have off in bed and I have only had one meal within two days. I know I need help but I don’t have the money for it or the time. I have never felt this insecure about my life, future, body, everything. I feel like I’m climbing up an escalator that’s going the wrong way, and no amount of running will get me to the top.   I don’t know where else to go or who to talk to. I feel like I’ve annoyed everyone already enough about me that I no longer want to talk to literally anyone. My fiancé sometimes even.   Well if you’ve made it this far I thank you sincerely... I just really needed to vent.

"My dad died today So I’m 16, coming on 17 next month.   Today my dad died at 42.   He hasn’t been doing so well for a few days. Yesterday his legs gave out and he was stuck on the bed with his lungs in pain if he lay on his back. For 24 hours, no sleep, food, or drink. Many more problems that I cannot remember, and he’s been feeling like shit emotionally too due to family issues.   My mom went to check in on him before going to the store. Since yesterday she’s been trying to get him to go to the hospital but of course he’s stubborn. When she came back from the store, she decided she’d have the ambulance come and pick him up because he REALLY needed to go in. Slurring his words, despite actually being sober in the mornings. When she went back to get his consent over phone to get picked up for the ambulance, he was out cold already. Lips purple, cold, lifeless. It had been only 30-40 minutes since she last saw him, alive, or whatever was left of his life.   I was there to see a fresh dead corpse.   My dad. My *dad.*  To say my world is crashing around me is an understatement. I’m just a fucking kid, going through my own battles with myself and now my dad is just *gone.* I didn’t have the best relationship with him but he was a really, really good guy and this stings like a bitch.

"Constant battle between ambition and not wanting to live. Since I was about 12 I've had recurring suicidal thoughts. The thing is, I don't have low self esteem or anything of that sort, it's actually quite the opposite and I always joke about being a narcissist. I may not be an actual narcissist, but I've always had a slight superiority complex.  I don't hate myself, but I just hate my life and the continuous chore known as living. On the outside, I've always been the life of the party, but deep down I don't ever remember being happy. As someone who's highly ambitious, it feels as if there's a never ending struggle between wanting to be successful enough to be well known or have an impact on the world, and wanting to stop existing. Yet with the prospect of the latter, comes the failure of the former. I know that if I lowered my expectations in life I would be mildly happier, yet the thought of settling for mediocrity gives me horrible anxiety and fills me with dread.   Recently things have gotten worse due to my university workload. I've been having trouble completing assignment and functioning in general. I've considered getting help but I feel deeply uncomfortable at the thought of opening up to someone, since I'm not a very emotional person. I've come to accept that I will probably never be happy. I've always wondered if I would be more likely to actually commit suicide if I ever attained the level of success I desire since I would have then achieved my goal in life, or if that would finally bring me the contentment I seek. I suppose it would be the former since I can never be content.

"A letter to … my sister, who has conquered her depression The letter you always wanted to write...  Family stuff happened and those wounds in you festered and festered. No one knew at the beginning. You hid it well under your sleeves and at the back of your eyes.  Before it all happened, I sometimes looked at you and thought that this would happen to you. It is the way you used to hold your emotion. It is as if you were full to the brim with it, but you forced it down, shoved it into a box  and hid it away. It was strange, but I was too young to understand. And then, slowly but surely, it took you over. You were so young. In my worst nightmares I imagined finding your lifeless body. I couldn’t wake you up. You wouldn’t wake up. My darling sister, even now I still imagine your cold body. How can such a deathly and frightening disease exist? You wasted away. Your cheeks were concave, and you didn’t even have to bend over for every bone of your spine to be visible. Your sharp wit and intelligent mind dulled. Your eyes were dark holes in your face. They were so empty. You slept all afternoon and night. I would lay my cardigan over you so you wouldn’t get cold. But I don’t think it made a difference. You were lost to us, floating in some different universe with no anchor or thread holding you to us. And then you tried to end it all. Multiple times. When I think about it, I blame you sometimes. But I know that the blame is not really towards you. It is towards me, of course. I am your sister. I should have been your protector. Is it OK if I say that I couldn’t really do anything but stand there and watch it run its course? Or is that just an excuse?  You are my best friend, even though I am not always yours. I wish I would be kinder to you, but I probably will always hold some of myself away. Maybe I am punishing myself. I don’t know. No one can say it didn’t take a toll on all of us. You probably don’t remember, but we were going to the corner shop together once. As we chatted, you were vehement that you were a failure. I asked you, what on earth were you a failure at? What life had you lived that you possibly could have failed? And you said: “I failed at life.” So what was the alternative, my dear? Death? I’m telling you, I lived those few years in the fear that you would be taken away from us by your own hand.  Even as I am writing this, I don’t know where to start or end. In my mind, it is such a mess. It doesn’t matter because you are well now. I have never seen someone work harder.

"Falling back into it I'm 16, and this weekend, I got into a big argument with my girlfriend of 7 months. We hadn't seen each other in 2 weeks, and our plans to see each other fell through. I tried to save our plans, but she seemed disinterested. I was so distraught and caught up in sadness and self-hatred that I, wanting to distance myself from the situation, not just leaving it alone, told her I wanted to break up with her out of sheer emotional irrationality. It turns out I was sadder without her, and she reached out to me to talk soon later. We got back together, and she said she was okay. The way she described the whole situation let me know she understood my plight completely, but I ruined her that day and she's been off ever since. She painted her nails black, screamed at her parents, texted all her friends to tell them how much of a terrible person I was, wrote ""Anon is a piece of shit cunt"" in her bathroom mirror in sharpie, and cried all day from the story she told.  I've fallen into a depression of guilt to a magnitude that I haven't experienced since I was a self-loathing near-friendless 7th grader with pent up emotions drowning it all out with video games while tanking his grades, watching the few distant friends get reward after reward, trophy after trophy.  I feel like I'm a piece of shit that doesn't deserve to breathe the air on this earth, and I don't know what to do. My parents are very unsympathetic and judgmental and my brother is borderline abusive. My girlfriend is the only one left who understands me. At this point, it's just me who has the problem, as she's gotten over the whole debacle, or so she says. Her mom even said ""ehh, you two were just stressed out teenagers"", but I'm still not convinced. I feel like there's something deeply wrong with me. Is there any advice or words of wisdom that I need to hear? I want to get back to normal.

"I’m losing the girl I’ve been with for 7 years and it’s because of my drug use, really bummed I’ve been with this girl since 9th grade I’m now 23 and I can honestly say I love her with my whole heart. I’ve been abusing drugs of all variety since I was 15, herion, meth, pills, uppers, downers, alcohol, marijuana, research chemicals, it doesn’t matter, but I prefer if it fits into a syringe. I have been to rehab 9 times since I was 15 I’d get sober then relapse sober then relapse sober etc.. I have had legal trouble and been in and out of jail she has been with me through it all, she has always been my better half. No words can explain how blessed I’ve been to have her. This past relapse I was clean for two years before hand and our relationship had never been better we were both happy we both trusted and we both loved no matter what. She helped me get my g.e.d. And she helped me through my grandfathers death (he raised me). I had subtle depression over it I felt like that was normal losing a loved one and all, but I eventually stopped doing the things I was susposed to to maintain my sobriety, I felt like I was cured and no longer needed all the recovery stuff. I was wrong. So one day I decided to take some benzodiazepines and that made me go straight to crystal meth in the time frame of a week I was back shooting meth spending all of my money on it and staying up for days. When on meth I have serious delusions I accused her of cheating on me I actually believed these delusions with my whole heart I felt so betrayed and hurt, I wanted to die. What I feel like really did it was I accused her of cheating on Facebook. Even after multiple people telling me I was wrong I couldn’t believe it, I just KNEW everybody was out to get me especially her, I was very unfair and called her names and called her at all hours of the night, completely out of character of me. After being the good loving boyfriend she knows and loves for two years I suddenly became a monster. I totaled the vehicle I owned and went to jail for possession with intent (Benzodiazepines) possession of marijuana and dui. I sat there for two months (thank god) while I was in there she told me she just couldn’t do this with me anymore and told me she has somebody else in her life, this crushed me. I contemplated suicide while I was in there fought anybody that even remotely rubbed me the wrong way and lost my appetite couldn’t sleep. So I get out and I know that I should just stay away from her because I love her and I don’t want to hinder her pursuing something else, I respected her decision to move on, after all I did publicly humiliate her. So right now I have been sober a month and I feel good in a clear minded healthy way, but I have this hole where she used to be I find myself riding around for hours thinking and crying. I’m very upset that I let this happen, currently I just can’t keep my mind off of her I just want our love and friendship back. I am very depressed and lately I have thought about using again but I would rather kill myself before I do that, I can’t get high anymore I would honestly rather be dead. I’m going to NA meetings, going to church, praying all day, but I can’t seem to ever feel better about losing her no matter what positive things I do. I’d rather be dead then to live without her and I don’t know what else to do.",losing girl year drug use really bummed girl th grade honestly say love heart abusing drug variety herion meth pill upper downer alcohol marijuana research chemical doe not matter prefer fit syringe rehab time sober relapse sober relapse sober etc legal trouble jail all better half word explain blessed her past relapse clean year hand relationship better happy trusted loved matter what helped ged helped grandfather death he raised me subtle depression felt like normal losing loved all eventually stopped doing thing susposed maintain sobriety felt like cured longer needed recovery stuff wrong day decided benzodiazepine straight crystal meth time frame week shooting meth spending money staying day meth delusion accused cheating actually believed delusion heart felt betrayed hurt wanted die feel like really did accused cheating facebook multiple people telling wrong not believe it just knew everybody especially her unfair called name called hour night completely character me good loving boyfriend know love year suddenly monster totaled vehicle owned went jail possession intent benzodiazepine possession marijuana duo sat month thank god told just not anymore told somebody life crushed me contemplated suicide fought anybody remotely rubbed wrong way lost appetite not sleep know just stay away love not want hinder pursuing else respected decision on did publicly humiliate her right sober month feel good clear minded healthy way hole used riding hour thinking cry upset let happen currently just mind just want love friendship back depressed lately thought using kill that high anymore honestly dead going na meeting going church praying day feel better losing matter positive thing do dead live not know do,0.4059869050979614,0.43041282892227173,0.36085134744644165

"I have no idea what to do My husband and I got into an argument last night that has lasted until this morning. Through out the entire argument, he has called me horrible names and hurt me deep. I thought i was almost over my depression, I thought i was getting better, but the things he has said has taken me from where I thought I was all the way back down to extremely emotional and having suicidal thoughts.  The argument started because I was talking too loudly to his son while trying to correct his behaviour. I am 38 weeks pregnant, and lately have been easily annoyed and upset by the boy not listening to me. My husband called me a bunch of hurtful things because I tried to explain why I was so upset. Later on in the night he told me my mom and oldest sister were no longer allowed to visit me for the birth of our child. Then he spent several more hours talking about how they were ""rot gut whores"" and how he doesn't want them around HIS son all because 2 years ago my sister invited me to a christmas dinner she knew I wasnt going to show up for and didn't specifically include my husband in the invitation. Yet his mom is coming a few weeks after, and she had left him and his brother to fend for themselves in a trailer in the middle of a forest only showing up to bring them food when they called her and begged her for it. But because she ""hasn't done anything to offend"" me, he is totally ok with her showing up.  Now he's talking about how if I want my mom to be here so bad, I can leave with her when she visits. And I've fully expressed how depressed I am to him and he isn't even worried in the slightest. He just keeps refering to my past as a teen who would sleep with practically anyone to try to get some sort of pleasure out of life, saying he bets I want to go back to that, that i would treat his son better if he were black, and that i would try harder to not upset my husband if he were black.  Part of me hopes something goes REALLY wrong in the birthing process and that I will die or be put in a coma from it. I've never felt so useless, stranded, and alone in my entire life.

I recently opened up about it to my girlfriend and she encouraged me to open up about it to my mother. I told her about almost everything. The one thing i did not mention to her was the... suicidal thoughts. Now, for our family “feelings” isnt our thing. We keep everything closed up and then repress it all. Thats what i have been doing for years not just with depression but everything. Now, these past three days have been brutal on me. I had no want to leave my bed or eat or even sleep. I just lay there and listen to music. I have been having suicial thoughts here and there these past three days. I will have happy moments here and there. But it doesnt last (shocker) and i just go back to feeling like pure awfulness. So, I am a 17 y/o male and I start senior year in August. We are a military family. My dream is the military. Thats all i have ever wanted. I want to follow my brothers footsteps because he is a total badass. All ive ever talked about to people, when they ask me what i want, to do is how badly i want to join the military. I do not think, with my current mental state, that i should go to the military. But i also fully believe that if i dont go i will disappoint everyone around me and they will be disgusted in me and i also believe that i will fall deeper into this dark hole i have been in.

"Does anyone else get very angry at just stupid little things?  It seems like over the last few months everyone around me is getting all they want out of life, and I am suffering with depression.  Which, of course, makes me feel worse and then I feel guilty for not being happy for them.  BUT, I also get angry when they ""flaunt"" their happiness around me.  My roommate just started seeing someone she met off eharmony.  We both signed up at the same time for fun, and while I was rejected time and time again, she was SO picky and then started seeing the first guy she went out with.  I am happy that she found someone and she really deserves it, but I get so ANGRY that she is constantly doing things with him.  It's like I've been replaced.  I feel like a 5 year old for thinking that, but I just can't help how I feel.  Today, for example, I asked her if she wanted to watch a movie I had gotten off our digital cable.  We have it until 9 tonight and she said she'd like to.  I was pretty excited seeing as how I hadn't been invited to a couple of events this weekend in lieu of ZACH going.  Well, she just came down stairs and said that Zach is going to be  coming over now.  This ticks me off because she broke our plans, and I don't have a way to ""escape"" when they are here.  I'm sure she's going to want to watch that movie with Zach, and, I know I'm being selfish, but I don't WANT him here tonight.  I haven't gotten to see Angela all weekend and the one night we have before going back to work HE is going to be here.  So I have to put on my happy face and pretend that I am glad for her and happy that she has someone and engage him in conversation when all I will feel like doing is crying.  It's unfair!  Why does it seem like when you are depressed, everyone around you has these GREAT things happening in their life.  Angela just got a promotion, a new car, and now a new boyfriend.

"this is my first post.  I am 27, 5 and a half months pregnant dealing with depression / anxiety.  I have taken antidepressants off and on for a few years but stopped this summer because my husband and I were trying to conceive.  My pregnancy has been pretty rough this time around ... (I have an 8 year old son).  I've had joint problems, severe morning sickness ... and terrible depression / anxiety.  My husband just doesn't understand what I'm going through ... he thinks that I'm being hateful or sad on purpose.  He contributes to a lot of the way that I feel.  He told me early in the pregnancy, that if something was to happen and I lose the baby or it was born with something wrong with it, he would have a hard time not blaming me for it even if the doctor said that nothing could have prevented it.  This was said to me because I wasn't taking my prenatal vitamins at the time because of the morning sickness.  I could see if I were using drugs or drinking but I do not do those things.  I don't understand his thinking on that subject.  My mother in law is another person getting on my nerves.  She comes over uninvited and gives out unwanted advice.  She also has a way of making me angry with her thoughtless comments which are hurtful and unnecessary.  I can't talk to my husband about this because he would see me as the ""bad guy"".  Sometimes I just want to be alone ... away from people ... I feel like I don't have any privacy anymore.  My husband always makes me feel worse when I talk to him about how I feel.  I don't know why he aggravates me to talk to him then always says .... ""Well, you ought to be thankful ... rrblah rrblah rrblah"".  It isn't like I don't know that I could have it worse ... but he never cares what I feel at that moment.  I guess I better shut up ...

"I am lost. I do not know what to do. Hey guys. This is my first post here, I made this account because I need to vent and I have no one else to listen to me.

I have considered quitting but I cannot justify saying no to the money. I am scared that if I quit to try to focus on myself, I will just eat more and more because I will be less busy.

"Hi everyone! I've been trying to find something or someone to help me out depression for ages, but I'm not an open person and it's been very difficult for me. I was never happy with my life and been just running away from problems. I left home when I was 18 and went to London. I wanted to start new life, but moved 11 times since then and always hoped I'll be happy in the new place. But it's getting worse and worse, I'm back home now, and start to realize, that I have nowhere to run and I'm getting old for that. I had a best friend in London, but she just used me and left when my ex went to jail. I have no one to talk to and I found so difficult to find new friends. I never talk about my problems, just to myself, when I'm with people, I'm completely different person, I'm so shy and I hate it. I hate it when I want to say something, but my mind doesn't let me and I'm just upset on myself. I don't remember the morning, when I woke up with a good mood or without headache. I've been thinking so much, that even when I stop I still feel this horrible pain in my head. I tried to bring my confidence up with drugs, but they just made it worse and I feel even more depressed. I've been thinking everyday. What am I going to do? and what is the worse about all this is that when I decide something what I feel is right and in few hours or minutes I think about it again and my feelings change and change again. ...it's driving me crazy.

"I've had a rough time of things lately, which is partly what made me search for this site. I've had recurrent unipolar depression since my mid teens with an associated anxiety disorder and a panic disorder that took root 5 years ago after I beat a drink problem I had at the time (between the age of 22 and 25 I used alcohol as a bit of a crutch which was a huge mistake). Anyway these days I am teetotal, on anti depressants and only really get a bad time with my depression A during the winter months or B if something triggers an episode (circumstantial). Usually it lifts up in the summer months (I think I might get a bit of SAD) but last year my mother passed away on the 23rd of March and it caused a huge crash in my mood which never lifted in time before the winter episode took hold. I dealt with it by comfort eating (I do comfort eat at times, but I also get bad food cravings in the winter for foods such as chocolate, cheese and carbohydrates, so pizza and chocolate ice-cream became my regular fodder for a while). Anyway that lead to weight gain which is besides the point but which I was planning on correcting (as I have done before) this summer when the food cravings wear off and my mood lifted. Unfortunately it's not lifted as of yet due to recent circumstances. Not only did I have the first anniversary of my mother's death to deal with, but my partner whom I loved very much decided that this would be the best time to dump me and completely rip me to shreds in the process. He basically emailed (he lives in another city) a few days before the anniversary of her death saying he wanted to end it. I tried to contact him but he wouldn't talk on the telephone or by voice, and would not respond to any emails I sent him. He then contacted me by IM on the day of her anniversary (23rd March) to rip me to shreds and tell me that he couldn't love someone like me before posting publicly on his journal running me down before posting disturbing replies to some of the posts on my journal anonymously (but I recognized his ISP number so I know it was him even though he denied it) making it sound as though the whole thing was deliberate. I wouldn't mind but it came out of the blue, the night before all this started he was discussing a work transfer to move to where I am and signed off with 'I love you'. Next day, wham. I'm social phobic so don't really have many friends I cant talk to about this, my mother was usually the one id turn to but she isn't here anymore, so my mood, although it usually lifts at this time of year, has taken a nose dive and I'm having trouble getting myself motivated again. The emotional pain I felt on that Thursday was like nothing I had felt for years, I just literally felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest. I couldn't sleep and I couldn't eat for the best part of that week, although I'm eating and sleeping again now. Am I over reacting to what he did, because I'm hurt as hell and completely and utterly infuriated with him at the same time? I know I can be slightly prone to being a bit of a drama queen at times (over reacting to stuff) and I can sometimes be a little paranoid. But the whole thing felt deliberate as though he intentionally intended to hurt me, and even now when I try to contact him to get answers he is being spiteful and running me down. Of course after this I spat a whole load of vitriol at him and now I'm being painted as the one that was in the wrong, and he is saying he did nothing that warranted the vitriol and is the innocent party in all of this. Of course he also interprets home truths as vitriol, and I tend to be very open and say things as I see them, to the point of lacking tact now and again. But whilst I'm willing to stand up and say I made a few mistakes and apologize, he is acting as though the blame is all mine and he did nothing wrong. I just can't seem to make him understand that the way he went about ending the relationship was one of the most hurtful ways anyone could have done it. I know he claims to suffer from bipolar disorder which he wont get treatment for, and I know that can make him highly moody, but I cant understand why he doesn't understand the hurt he caused me, or if he does, how someone who professed to love me, doesn't even seem to care. He seems totally and utterly cold, so cold it's chilling. I know he gets periods of emotional flatness because he told me, and he also told me he hears voices as well. Could he be suffering from some kind of depression related psychosis? One post he made to my journal was: Wisdom comes only to those who seek it, and sometimes to those who deserve it regardless of perfection, intent or even understanding. The common denominator though, seems to be deed. For one must do, or be done to, in order for wisdom to take root. Am I misreading that? Or reading into it? So am I over reacting?

"Going to bed in the morning, waking up at night. For about a year now, I've been going to sleep in the morning when the rest of my family is getting ready to start their day and getting out of bed in the evening/night.  It started because I transferred to online school and I thought it would be fine to stay up until 3 am or so, but it's gradually gotten worse and worse and as I'm typing this it's 9 am and I'm just now getting ready to sleep. I'm guessing I'll wake up at about 3 pm and actually get out of bed at 4.  It's really screwing with my coursework and making my mental and physical health worse.

"I'm a 23 year old female who has suffered from depression for the last 3 years. I remember having bouts of it in high school, hating myself and thinking i was ugly and worthless, but it generally passed and things got better. Then all of a sudden when i was 20, i just started crying constantly, feeling out of control, wanting to dig a hole and bury myself, not knowing what to do with myself, feeling hysterical. I went on medication after a few months, and things improved, but it's something i still deal with every day.  I am at university full time, as well as working part time, and just feel like i'm constantly on the edge of going insane. I just moved to a new city, and feel so lonely, wanting attention but i feel like no one's interested. Worst of all, i miss so much university (because i can't get out of bed in the morning) that my tutors regard me as a bad student, which makes me feel so bad, because i know i'm smarter than most of the people in our class. I just want everyone to know i'm not lazy and boring, i just feel like my body is made of lead and i have no energy and no drive to get up in the morning. I have just started seeing a psychologist and she is really great, but it's so expensive i have to work extra shifts at work just to manage, which makes me even more stressed out!  I don't want to take time off university because i took last year off and it made me feel worse.

"Hi, I'm pretty sure I'm suffering from depression, and probably have been for the last 18 months or so. It's only been lately that I feel like the rug has really been jerked out from under me, though. I think it started in mid-2004 when I became seriously ill. Between June and September 2004, I spent three weeks in the hospital, umpteen visits to the E/R, and finally, major surgery to correct the problem. Physically, I'm fine now. But we had no health insurance (long story), and when the hospital bills started rolling in, we tried our best to pay the bills, but there was just no way. We ended up filing bankruptcy, I lost my home business, and we very nearly lost our home. Ever since then, I've felt like I'm falling down a dark tunnel, even though the bankruptcy is over with. I was drinking part of this time, but have stopped, thinking that may have been causing the problem. But it's actually become worse since I've stopped.  Here's my ""symptoms"": I don't usually have trouble falling asleep, but I can't seem to stay asleep for more than a couple of hours. It's hard to go back to sleep, so I usually just get up. Weight gain because I find myself eating even when I'm not hungry. The ""comfort food"" thing, I guess. I tend to be a ""stress"" eater, and goodness knows I've had a lot of that lately! I used to enjoy camping and reading books (etc.), but I don't care about any of that anymore. I couldn't sit down now and read a book no matter how much I wanted to. I get through 5 or 6 pages, and totally lose interest. That's depressing in itself, because I used to love reading so much. I have no desire to get out and do anything. I literally close myself up in my spare bedroom every waking hour, only coming out to use the bathroom and to fix supper for my husband. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I'm not happy, but I can't pinpoint exactly what would make me happy. I honestly can't think of anything. I have no energy whatsoever.  I've been dealing with a TON of guilt over the bankruptcy. After all, the bankruptcy wouldn't have happened if I hadn't gotten sick, you know? I feel horrible for dragging my husband's credit down along with mine, but the way things were, I couldn't file bankruptcy by myself. Our credit was PERFECT until I got sick. My husband sold a bunch of his personal belongings to help pay bills, as did I, but it was so unfair for him to have lost his stuff on account of me. He's never once complained, but I still feel terrible. I've also been kicking myself for the loss of my home business. I can't help but feel like if it hadn't failed (I couldn't keep up with it during my illness), that we wouldn't have had to file bankruptcy. I've never been a crier, but I sure feel like it sometimes. I can't seem to do anything ""right"" these days. Irritable!!! Throwing stuff, being unreasonable, getting mad about petty things. The one thing I haven't experienced (thankfully) is suicidal thoughts. A few random ""morbid"" thoughts here and there, but nothing I'd ever act on. Last night I took several online self-tests, and all of them said I had mild to moderate depression. One even said severe. I guess the next step would be to go to the doctor, but I don't have a doctor. My sister is taking Zoloft for panic attacks and a PMS disorder, so I guess I'll ask her who she's seeing. What do they do ... just ask questions similar to the online questionnaires? Or? I've been reading about all the different kids of medicines, and found the information about Wellbutrin to be the most interesting. Obviously the doctor would know what I need better than I would, but I sure don't want to take something that's going to make me gain even more weight or feel like a zombie. At least one good thing, though. We do, thankfully, have insurance now. Another issue is my husband and family. To them, depression is something that people should be able to ""just shake off"". They don't understand that I CAN'T seem to ""shake it off"", otherwise, I gladly would. My husband is supportive in other ways, but he scoffed when my sister started taking Zoloft. To them, if they can't ""see"" the problem, it doesn't exist. I'm sure they don't mean to be ""mean"", but they just don't understand. Sorry for rambling.

"How's it going, all who read. My name is Greg, I'm 19 and have had depression for basically as long as I remember. Here's a brief history of my journey through depression and the treatments I have endeavored. I began on lexapro. It seemed to be helping and then it quit on me (or perhaps vice versa). After that I tried zoloft, and wellbutrin, but to the same effect. Then I turned my world to narcotics (mainly, marijuana and DXM). They helped ALOT, but because they are illegal, I felt a constant public stigma and guilt. I couldn't take it, despite the amazing effects of both drugs. I'm now taking Paxil CR, but I'm going to quit it because it isn't working. I'm beginning to lose hope altogether. It seems apparent to me that SSRIs just aren't for me, or maybe I just haven't found the right one. The real problem with depression is that you have to wait a month on each drug just to see it it's going to work. Those months can feel like years. Anyways, that's who I am. I hope to make a few friends here, and a lot of advice as well. Does anyone one else share these symptoms (if so, and if you think you can help contact me please): Chronic fatigue, lack of motivation/desire, inability to enjoy life, insomnia (including the other obvious and supplementing symptoms) The real killer is I know I have the potential to be someone great, but I have to become happy first...Greg",going read greg depression basically long remember brief history journey depression treatment endeavored began lexapro helping quit or vice versa tried zoloft wellbutrin effect turned world narcotic mainly marijuana dxm helped alot illegal felt constant public stigma guilt not it despite amazing effect drug taking paxil cr going quit not working beginning lose hope altogether apparent ssri just not me maybe just not right one real problem depression wait month drug just going work month feel like year anyways am hope make friend here lot advice well doe share symptom if so think help contact please chronic fatigue lack motivationdesire inability enjoy life insomnia including obvious supplementing symptom real killer know potential great happy firstgreg,0.4309194087982178,0.4155498147010803,0.4807421565055847

"Maybe They are Wrong About It All We are always told ""when you are depressed, your brain is lying to you about how bad everything is"".   What if they are wrong?  If someone is piss poor and starving, can't pay their bills, replace their moth-eaten clothes or go out to do interesting things, surely their money situation really IS as bad as all that.  If someone has no family, no friends and has been bullied/abused by everyone they've met in life, perhaps their social situation really IS as bad as all that.  If someone has had lots of physical health issues like cancer, chronic pain, obesity etc, maybe their physical woes really ARE as bad as all that.  Some people go through all of the above, all at once. So maybe life IS as bad as all that for them.  The whole ""your brain is lying about how bad things are"" thing often just feels like ""you're just imagining your problems"".

Where I work now one of the first friends I made was a gentleman who has since retired. He told me that he didn't read the news, watch TV or listen to the radio (except for light jazz) because he found that to do so was just too much pain, it did not ""serve"" him to subject himself to that kind of pain. He seemed to be generally very happy and upbeat to me so there must be something to it. As for your friend - that's a tough one but maybe since she is your friend she might understand if you explain to her how incredibly painful her TV choices are on you. Does she ever read or post here? Anyway, it is GREAT talking with you again and I look forward to the next chat.

"Get myself to be more active/alive? So, my depression is getting worse and worse since a few years. I'm in law school and I'm in the last year of preparation - in our country, this is THE BUSIEST TIME ever for those students - like, they start studying at 7 in the morning at stay until 11 in the night at the library. nonstop studying for 1-1,5 years in preparation for the big exams.  I started last october. it's july. I have maybe studied on two or three days, seriously. the other time, I just sit at home, in a kind of weird freeze. I'm BORED out of my mind, my brain is longing for some activity, and I actually really want to be all busy and studying and feel like I have a purpose.

It feels like it's too late for the studying thing (exams are in spring and I have no idea about the subjects and skip all classes I'm paying for) and I have no idea what else to do with my time.

Any idea how to get myself to get up and DO SOMETHING? The sitting around is what is probably making me most depressed, because I watch my life burn down and kind of can't do anything about.

"Yep - I know this all too well. And it is a sad state of affairs. But you are aware of it. Best you know what is going on than be surprised. SN, I hear what you are saying about not being able to weather another strike against your stability now. And I hope you do not have to go. I will pray with you that you are spared from the cuts this time, but while you are praying and hoping, consider the issue of your personal power. If you are feeling shaky in other areas of life, I doubt that you feel that you have any. I have been in that situation over many things. Remember the difference between what you DO have control over and what you do NOT have control over: you can control the way you approach this job, your punctuality, your diligence, your politeness to other workers; you CANNOT control the decisions made on the top and how they will affect your status. I have been reading a book called ""Corporate Confidential"" by Cynthia Shapiro. She was an HR manager for her whole life and spills the beans on how companies decide who will stay and who will go. It was an eye-opener for me. Perhaps it can help you at this juncture. In your own prayers, remember to ask God not just for the optimal decision to be made on your behalf, but for the power to see where you do and do not have control and for help taking charge of the areas that you actually can control. When you are in a phase of instability, it seems that more and more garbage gets thrown your way. But a turning point comes when the indignation of being tossed on everyone else's sea propels you into action. That turning point came for me about 9 years ago when a really awful roommate had to be ejected. I felt a power I had never felt before - the ability to take charge of my own life, not waiting for someone else's decision to tell me whether I was going to be OK or not. I am trying to find my way back to that point. I hope you do too.

"For those on antidepressants, is it working? Alternatives to antidepressants? Okay so I’m going back to a psychiatrist next week for my depression. I’ve been going since high school and over the years have had depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, lack of motivation and interest, high anxiety, numbness, hopelessness, etc etc. recently it’s been coming back.  I’ve been on Zoloft which made me feel like a numb zombie and bupropion which I didn’t feel was working. I’ve also tried Xanax (made me calmer but high) and a mood stabilizer that didn’t really help. I’ve since gotten off medication by my own choice but the problems are coming back. Generally I don’t like rx drugs and would rather do it naturally but it’s not going away.

"I've posted a few times on these forums and everyone has always been so helpful and supportive, so I'm hoping I can get some help with this.  For the last few weeks, my depression has been so horrendous, worse than it's ever been, that I have not been able to go to work.  I keep calling in sick, and then when I can finally make myself go, I hide in the bathroom crying or go to an empty office (not in my cubicle) and call my mother and cry to her.  I've been in touch with my pdoc, who is in the process of passing me off to another doctor.   Granted, it's at my request, as he is not on my insurance.  However, he's not willing to put me on any other types of medications since he won't be seeing me regularly.  I've spoken to my long - time pdoc from Dallas, my hometown, and he knows me very well.  I trust him more than any other doctor, which is not saying much, but he says that I'm unipolar, aka major depressive disorder, and a mood stabilizer would be the next best thing to try since all the antidepressants are not working.  (was taking 30mg celexa, just upped to 40mg when this all started.)  I'm seeing a new pdoc that's covered by my insurance on Monday, so maybe things will move forward.  Ok, so back to the work thing.  My supervisor is not sympathetic to my problem.  In all fairness, I have not told her details.  I find that most people do not consider mental disease a real medical problem.  She suggested that I talk to Human Resources about taking some type of leave if I don't know when I'll be better.  I'm working on that and hoping one of these doctors will sign for me.  The biggest problem I have is the guilt over missing work.  I never imagined that the depression could get so bad that I couldn't just suit up and show up.  That's been my motto every time things get rough.  I guess I'm looking for validation here.  If I really do have it in my to get to work, I certainly can't find it.  I'm a very responsible person, so this is not like me.  The only time I've ever called in sick is when I was having depression issues, but never more than one day.  Everyone gets a sick day, and I never get the flu or anything, so I don't feel guilty about those days.   What do I do?  Am I looking at this the wrong way?  It's so hard to be objective when you are so low.  My saving grace is that my parents (who are far away in Dallas) are being the most supportive people in the world.  They believe me when I say I just can't get to work, since that's not like me, but that's not like them either, so I know they want me to get there if I can.

"Hi, after 2 posts on the DF I'm finally beginning to work out the format. Excuse the typo's as going through Prozac withdrawals and kind of shaky! I'm 27 years old, I live in the UK, Studied psychology, trained psychiatric nurse, behavior family therapist, and trainee CB therapist. Not sure if I can go back to my CBT course as I have missed so much time from university due to my current episode. This is my worst episode ever. I have had depression for 8 years, and have been ashamed and embarrassed by it. As my life seems to be ebbing away, I have come out with it and seeking psychiatric help. My problem has been that I work in psychiatry and have feared loosing my job/career. It means everything to me. It's the only thing I have and couldn't bare seeing it go down the toilet. Friends don't understand and know how to discuss the topic with me. My family doesn't know as it would devastate an already broken family. For 8 years I've suffered in silence, cried silent screams, been tormented by my own brain. I hate imagining living a life like this especially when the long term effects I'm reminded of every day (my patients). The only person I had was my ex girlfriend, we split last year. CAUSE? me. Stress got the better of me, my thinking became screwed and I've lost her, for life. She was the only one I could talk to, some one I had known for, 12 odd years. Depression has ruined my life. This episode has been an eye opener. This is the first time planet earth is hearing about my struggle. Something, which may have otherwise been lost. My secrets buried with me. Don't confuse this as a suicide note. It isn't. It's me talking about things in this way for the first time. I'm over the crisis point but nowhere near my usual self and need to sort my medicines out with my doctor as soon as possible. I've had a brave chat with my boss who is going to sort out a psychiatrist in the next 10 days, all being well. I have only taken one OD in 1998 with a serious intent to kill myself. Doctors said I survived as I woke up. For years I've avoided talking about it, never wanted to see a psychiatrist but realize now (well for now) that there is 2 people inside me. One is me, the other is depression and to stand the best chance of staying well and keeping well then I need to face I have a problem. Around 3 weeks ago I was so actively suicidal, I was thinking of jumping off a bridge into the river, i searched the internet for ways to kill myself. I'm out of that acute phase but don't trust myself. I have tried SSRIs but they just don't agree with me so it looks like I'm going back on Mirtazapine. I stopped taking it sometime ago as I put on weight. Since last year I've lost 2 stone through diet and exercise. In the last 3 weeks I've lost 4 lbs as a result of depression. Right now my mind's blank. I've never chatted to anyone on this forum before but I know you guys know what I'm going through. My life has never been the same since 1998. It never will be. My dad died in 2002 since then things have worsened. I have so much to say I could write on but going to leave it for now. You guys are the first to hear my full (well pretty full) story. I have never had the courage to speak like this before.

"10 years I've been managing depression and I was doing well, until last Monday. Quick back story: 38/m/Ireland. I was a competitive Powerlifter and represented my country on 2 occasions with great success. My life was lifting; setting goals, reaching targets, smashing PBs...all helped with creating a future for myself.  I started to feel unwell around December 2016 and developed a persistent, non-productive cough. Series of tests led me to an echocardiograph where it was discovered I was suffering Heart Failure. Dilated Cardio Myopathy caused by a viral infection, left my hearts function at 20%EF.  Apparently I had a few months to live if I hadn't caught it. Ironically, now, I wish they hadn't discovered it. My world flipped upside down. No Powerlifting, no excessive exercise, restricted fluid intake, no over exertion, meds for the rest of my life, regular reviews in my heart clinic, multiple ambulance emergency rides to A&amp;E when my heart goes irregular. Hospital, pharmacy, hospital, pharmacy... Seems to be my life for the past year.  Last Monday I snapped. It hit me. Everything I lost came crashing in on me. I got in my car, picked a place I knew well to ram my car into at 120mph. I was screaming at myself to do it. My left hand steering towards the end, my right hand steering me to survive. An image of my dog in my mind kept me on the road. I knew she'd miss me too much.  I'm still very low now despite all my meds. I still wish I had gone through with it.

"I'm Weakest At Night... I don't understand the reason for this, but for as long as I can remember I've always been weakest during the night time. I feel weak mentally, emotionally, physically, internally... I feel like I can't go on, like I can't keep fighting, like I've had enough... I freeze over, my body locks up, my fear paralyzes me, and my mind becomes my enemy...     Night seems endless because I can't see much of anything no matter where I try to look.

And yet, though a part of me yearns for light, for the warm comfort of the sun, it only depresses me. In the light I can see what I truly am, I can see a reflection of something I've grown to hate. When I look at my reflection I want to smash the mirror so I can no longer see the truth of my insignificant existence. In the light I can see everyone else, either continuing on with their lives without a thought of me or a second glance. Or I see other people like me suffering and it both hurts and gives me a strange, and possibly, a cruel comfort.

"I just told all 100 students I teach I have depression in an email about finals week I'm an undergraduate TA at a university, in an interdisciplinary class about the brain. I absolutely love being a TA, but admittedly this quarter it has been a struggle mentally, I often feel anxious that I am doing a horrible job.  I sent out this email to all 100 of my students about finals:  Hi everyone,  These next two weeks will be a really, really tough time for all of you. I know how incredibly hard you all have worked this quarter, and how hard you will push yourselves during this final stretch, but there are 2 other things I want you to know:  1) I, the other TAs, and our professor will not be disappointed if you do not perform as well you want, so you shouldn't be either. Tests and grades are not always the best reflection of you as students/scientists, and they are most certainly are not a reflection of your worth as a person. All a test assesses is how much content you remember and how well you can take a test at a certain time on a certain day. It is simply one data point, and as you should all know by now, 1 data point is not representative of the population. For many of you, you have other finals/presentations/responsibilities going on, and it'll be difficult to find time to study. For others, you may want so badly to study a lot, but can't because you are so stressed and anxious. I personally deal with anxiety and depression, and I know how utterly frustrating it is when your mind doesn't work as well as you want it to.   2) Take care of yourself. Eat good food, get some sleep, spend time with people you love.   So, while you prepare for finals these next weeks, keep these two things in mind. You are all incredibly curious, kind, intelligent and important people. I brag all the time that I get to work with the most amazing group of students who bring unique and valuable contributions to this class everyday, and inspire me to be the best TA I can possibly be.  Cheering you on!! ~austen1996  (I can't believe I just told all my students about my mental illness, but it honestly feels so liberating to do so. It also feels so hypocritical of me to send this, because I attribute much of my self-worth to academics and don't practice much self-care.....but I felt like this needed to be said).

"Hello Tommy! to DF! I'm glad you joined! This board is a great place for information and support. Take your time browsing through the topics. I'm sure there will be lots of things you can relate to. When you feel comfortable enough, feel free to share any of your thoughts, questions, concerns, experiences, etc...Congrats on taking your first steps towards recovery! I think it takes a lot of courage to start treatment. I know it took me quite a while to admit to myself I couldn't handle my situation on my own any longer. I think you did great starting on both talk therapy and medicines! I hope you find therapy useful and that you and your therapist can work towards better skills to cope with the stressors in your life. Concerning your medication. There's a room dedicated to your antidepressant Prozac. You'll find lots of information there. Check it out sometime. One of the downsides of antidepressants is the fact that it takes a while for them to kick in. You only started about 10 days ago so you'll have to give the Prozac some time to be able to fully benefit from it. Meanwhile I hope you're not having too many side effects! Tom, thanks for joining.

"I've really hit a new low I cannot believe how depressed I am right now, I am just imploding. I got fired from yet another job for being incompetent as usual. Usually I'm pretty good at bouncing back but this job just broke something inside me. I'm a damn failure. Three attempts at college. Flunked out after the first year. That's ok, college isn't for everyone. Try a bunch of min wage jobs. Get fired or quit with in the first month or two. I can't do damn thing.  I have no motivation to do anything at all anymore. I used to clock around 3-4 hours a day gaming because it was something I genuinely enjoyed. I've gotten 30 minutes in an entire damn week. I literally just can't muster the strength to want to do it. I've been pulling away from people because it's just exhausting to talk to them. I literally just get tired after five minutes of conversation. It's insane. We'll barely be through the how's your day been going before I already want to go somewhere else because it's so draining.  I've hit a complete rock wall in therapy. I tell my therapist nearly all of this shit and she helps me as best she can but there's only so much she's able to do. She has no magic way of instilling me with motivation. Like... to put it into perspective. I stared at a wall for 2 hours today. Because I just was to tired to anything else. 2 hours! I wasn't thinking about anything. I wasn't being bored. I just don't have motivation to do anything!  But what's worse is the moment I start thinking again is the moment all the sadness washes over me. It's like I'm in the middle of a vast, dark ocean and can't find shore. I swim and I swim and I swim but salvation is just nowhere to be seen. And I'm beginning to grow tired.  I have no future ahead of me. Nothing to look forward too. I go through thousands of career tests and applications and all I see is that I'm either not interested enough or not good enough for any career. And I can't simply work for money. Money in and of itself just isn't good enough for me to work at a job I hate or am completely uninterested in. That's the strain of these minimum wage jobs, some of them I've had to quit because they've literally made me suicidal.  I'm so lost right now. The world looks like a very dark place where I have to suffer in agony just to get by. I'm so tired of fighting. I'm so tired of trying. I'm just. So. Tired. It has been a very long time since I've been this low. I feel like I'm doomed. Like this is all the happiness I'll ever be afforded.

"Girlfriend attempted to break her arm to avoid going to work My girlfriend began her summer job in a hospital earlier this summer where she mostly cleans and prepares meals for the patients. She has been pretty upfront about the fact that she is stressed during the days and doesn't want to go to work most days. Since we don't live together we see eachother about three times per week although less during summer since work prohibits that to an extent. She has never during our two year long relationship showed any signs of self harm nor depression. However, today i saw her for the first time this week and I noticed bruises on her fore arm. She unwillingly explained that she had tried to break her arm in order to not have to go to work anymore for the rest of the summer. She said that she had had a panic attack and in desperation smashed her arm into a metal pole  in order to break her arm. She promised to let me know if she felt that way again but I am not sure if she is going to. She also made me promise to not tell anyone about it.  How can I help prevent her from harming herself another time? What other things are there that I should be aware of concerning her well being?

"I joined yesterday and have been reading through some of the posts. Thought I had better introduce my self.  I live in the UK.  Looking back on my life I think I have always had depression. It got worse though, 3.5 years ago after the birth of my son. I though i had PND at the time. I was always crying, felt really low and would panic if I was left alone with the baby. It put a huge strain on my marriage and lots of arguments because my husband though I had gone off him. I went back to work put couldn't cope, lack of motivation etc. but like someone said below I put on a 'happy face' to make people think that I was OK. I muddled through for a year then went to see a GP who put me on Prozac. Stupid me came off it after 2 months thinking I was OK. Slowly the depression came back, I wasn't coping with my job, the simplest tasks at work and at home were impossible to face, I couldn't concentrate or make decisions. Last Spring it all got too much. I was getting up crying every morning, I became agoraphobic. I phoned in work and said i couldn't go in. I saw the GP and went on Prozac. I took 2 months off work. I stayed on Prozac until last September. And then, guess what, it all came back with a vengeance a few months ago. This time I was also feeling suicidal which really scared me. So I am now back on the Prozac and determined to stay on it.  I think I have generalized depression made worse by circumstances. The birth of my son, trying to keep a job down and be a Mom, and my husband. Last year my husband really turned to alcohol and ended up ill in hospital. He has been on incapacity benefit ever since, so our relationship and our finances have really suffered. He has changed to. Even though he says he loves me he gets angry a lot, shouts at me, criticizes me, puts me down. I don't know how much more of it I can take, without leaving him. I make excuses for him, that it is his illness and lack of earning power that make him like that but it is no excuse to turn me into a nervous wreck who is scared to say anything in case he shoots me down. The Prozac has reduced but not removed my depression and I still have the odd day where I want to run away. I keep thinking 'will it go away if I leave my husband?' I no longer love him but life has dealt a difficult blow to us both recently and maybe one day when the stresses have been removed I will love him again.  Anyway that's my story (sounds similar to Vanyas who i have PM'd).

"Rolling down hill Hi all,  It all started last year when I quit my bachelor in Physical Therapy. That study didnt seem right for me and I dropped out in feb 2016. From februari till september I've worked a depressing job in an order picking centre to pay for my next year of college. But after that there wasnt any motivation for anything left over in me.   This year I started a new study, lifesciences. It started all fun for the first two months. Because we had the basics of chemistry, anatomy, algebra and physics. But in the beginning of november the second semester started and thus I had tests from the first semester. Failed them all. In the weeks leading to the tests I couldnt concentrate or motivate myself to do anything. I was just at my room doing absolutely nothing. 14 november was my birthday, turned 19. Everyone forgot it except my gf (for 2,5 years). Was a fun day and made me forget the test results and gave me a little hope. Today she told me she was seeing someone else for the last 3 months because I had too little time to see her, because I was always busy with school.   Im feeling that everything is worse. My job sucks but I have to keep it as I got to keep up with school costs. Already got pretty hefty debt from those two halve years of university. I just feel that everything that I do fails. Like the last 2 years I've accomplished nothing. I would like to travel if I'm going to have my second gap year but my funds wouldnt allow it. Working would be my only option but the only jobs that are available will push me over the edge.  But there is something good at the horizon; there is a small chance I'm getting accepted in to the police academy, but that's only a small chance so no big hopes as that makes it worse.",rolling hill hi all started year quit bachelor physical therapy study didnt right dropped feb februari till september worked depressing job order picking centre pay year college wasnt motivation left me year started new study lifesciences started fun month basic chemistry anatomy algebra physic beginning november second semester started test semester failed all week leading test concentrate motivate anything just room doing absolutely nothing november birthday turned forgot gf for year fun day forget test result gave little hope today told seeing month little time her busy school im feeling worse job suck got school cost got pretty hefty debt halve year university just feel fails like year accomplished nothing like travel going second gap year fund wouldnt allow it working option job available push edge good horizon small chance getting accepted police academy small chance big hope make worse,0.4578801095485687,0.47484657168388367,0.3163507878780365

"I am overwhelmed by guilt over my boyfriend's sexual assault of my once-best friend. My boyfriend of 2 years and I both suffer from mental health issues and trauma. I found out somewhat recently that months ago, when my then-best friend was sleeping over we were both asleep in the bed and he touched her sexually. Apparently he was stoned and thought he might start a threesome (it was casually mentioned as a possibility earlier).  I know what he did was horrible. It makes me sick to my stomach to think that I was there and couldn't help. It makes me throw up and stay up at night knowing that I stayed with him. On the other hand, he himself is absolutely sick with guilt. He's been having non-stop anxiety attacks, crying spells, and moments of catatonia and he can't stop saying how horrible it was that he did that and how he wants to be a good person. I believe he is genuine and my first reaction is to make sure he gets treatment so nothing close to that ever happens again. He checked himself into a psychiatric ward last night.  I'm also so overwhelmed by guilt by how selfish my internal response has been. He has cheated on me before multiple times, and I can't help but ruminate on how if I were prettier this wouldn't have happened and how it effects me. One recent (smaller) time just happened and I've had to take care of his emotions while being angry about this main terrible incident and that one. Furthermore, I'm selfishly worried about how badly this is affecting me. One of the few (maybe only?) things going right in my life is school and this is affecting me so negatively in my inability to concentrate or motivate myself. I'm also upset by how critical others have been of me in this even though they are at least partially justified. He posted his story to Reddit and got mostly cautious support. I posted mine and got a lot of messages calling me a pervert, an enabler, a shitposter, and a terrible person. He told his parents and one of the things they said was ""all three of you made mistakes"". Unrelated, but last night he posted a photo of us in the ER and a girl who hates me replied ""ew you're back with her? Nonono what are you doing.""

"The world needs more ""lollipop moments"". Back in middle school, I was helping out at a sunday school, tutoring primary kids. There was this adorable little girl who was struggling to sing the right tunes of a hymn. Even though I have absolutely no musical background, I tried to help her get her vocals and lyrics right by singing the hymn together. Eventually, I told her to continue repeating it herself and that every practice is an improvement from the last.   She would call me frequently just to sing her new hymns and I would challenge her to learn a new hymn every week, this routine went on for quite a while between ourselves...  Fast forward to today, I'm currently a struggling undergrad students coping with depression and stress and well as deteriorating health due to extreme fatigue. Bad grades and crippling financial debt are the least of my concerns. Many days I would feel tired and unmotivated to do anything... and barely making it to lectures only to zone off. At days I would think of suicide as well. There was nobody I could turn to that I felt I could relate to or even understand me...  It was not until a few days ago I received an email from the girl's mother, the girl was unfortunately diagnosed with an illness that made her lose up to 90% of her hearing. However, she was recently accepted to a prestigious musical academy, and sent me the audition tape of her performance thanking me for my encouragement. That song that she performed, was the very first hymn she struggled when I first came up to her.   Knowing that the girl went through so much hardship just to chase the dream I stimulated her from her youth gave me so much hope at the darkest point of my life. Knowing that I had the capacity to influence a big change in a little girls life gave me the purpose to live. Even though I had to wait for 8 years for this news, it was worth it.  TL;DR  We all have the ability to give small act of kindness which goes a long way.

"Post-Graduation Depression I recently graduated from college, and over the past couple of months I’ve grown increasingly depressed. I feel this profound sense of loss and it feels as if the color has drained from the world. What’s shocking to me is that I honestly hated college - I was either working or studying 24x7. I rarely had a single moment for myself or friends and was constantly exhausted and anxious. Now, I have a great job, live with my girlfriend, have almost no debt (thanks to working so much in college), and live in my ideal area. My life is comparatively so much better, but I feel this knot in my stomach as if I just finished a good book or beat the story of a video game and now I’m finally seeing how much of myself I’ve given up to get to where I am. Life feels devoid of adventure and I feel like I have no passion left. I’ve struggled with depression for a long time, but it’s weird to have it catch up with me at the point in my life where past sacrifices were meant to mitigate it.

"Finding it difficult after college Hi. Im 23 and lately I've lost interest in everything. It kinda started last semester, I finished my masters and missed out on a 1.1 from a bad assignment, can't find any jobs relating to my degree and am currently stuck in a miserable retail job. Since the new year started everything has been getting tougher. I've been applying for PhDs, science jobs and anything that i could use my degree for, and everything Ive applied for I've been rejected from. My supervisor I was applying for scholarships with has kinda just abandoned me because I was declined from a competitive scholarship he wanted his project funded for. I feel like everything relates back that I narrowly missed out on my top grade so I'm basically an idiot. Since then I'm in a retail job where I get shouted at by customers every day. My roommate and best friend landed me saying she was leaving our apartment and ringing the landlord-literally out of nowhere-, so I've to leave the city and move back home.

"Advice on where to post for advice on taking antidepressants. Hi, UK based poster - I've recently taken my Doctors advice and got a prescription for antidepressants. I've been in-and-out of various states of mild to severe depression throughout my teens &amp; twenties, but I've always figured this is just something everyone has to deal with at some stage or another, so I've never sought help even when falling off a proverbial cliff edge. After much deliberation, someone I care deeply about got me to try counselling, but I find that I'm really not getting much out of it right now, as I don't have the will to try, and my focus is all over the place (I'm being tested for ADHD too, but I'm still awaiting the results). My Doctor suggested trying a combination of antidepressants and CBT (the latter of which I am currently attempting to source a support group for), however I have an underlying phobia of long-term medication after seeing several people close to me, use it as a crutch and just become something wholly unfamiliar to me as a result. I've been prescribed Citalopram (Celexa for those stateside) but like I said - I have deep-seated reservations about taking them and before I tried, I wanted to see if there was anywhere/anyone I could talk to about their experiences on the drug and any perhaps any suggestions they could offer about managing short-term (6-9 months) antidepressant medication?

"I seem to have depression the worst, first thing in the morning lately.  Just started with a new pdoc after 7 months. with another pdoc since this latest episode occured.  My old pdoc thought I could have a mild bipolar disorder but wasn't sure.  My 20 mg of prozac had stopped working after several years of keeping me stable.  She started me on lamictal and I am now up to 100 mg / day.  Stopped the prozac in early January and got worse, but not right away.  I was having a good week / bad week type pattern depending on where I was in my menstrual cycle while I was on the prozac.  I have battled depression on and off for 20 years.  Particularly bad postpartum and this recent episode.  I am 41 years old and haven't felt this bad since I had my daughter 8 years ago.   My new doctor thinks I don't have an ounce of bipolar and that I am just in a depression (I tend to agree with her).  We decided together to add Lexapro to the mix and see if that helps me level out all the days of the month.  I have been on it almost 2 weeks patiently waiting for some results - I am well aware of the waiting game.  I am also taking Xanax XR in the evenings for sleep and to avert morning anxiety.  I take my Lamictal in the morning and a very small (half of the lowest dose of xanax) as well.  I seem to get moving and can be quite productive during my day after I take the Lamictal / xanax - don't know if this is a placebo effect??  My question is, has anyone experienced this a.m. depression that seems to lift a bit later in the day?  Also, does anyone take Lamictal for unipolar depression?

"Martin Luther King Jr. And depression ""As my sufferings mounted I soon realized that there were two ways in which I could respond to my situation -- either to react with bitterness or seek to transform the suffering into a creative force. I decided to follow the latter course""- King JR. Today got me thinking...We need to figure out how we can turn our discontent, anxiety, anhedonia, insecurity, self hatred, and the meaninglessness that we all feel into real world change that we can see, touch , and feel proud of in a tangible form. We need to figure out as a community, how we can re-direct our negative feelings into helping  others, and maby in the process we will be helping ourselves. I think alot of us feel meaningless, and have a hard time creating motivation to get us out of bed, besides our rare and far between moments of clarity. If we could find a way to re-direct our negative energy and encourage eachother to work towards causes we believe in, we could change the world while at the same time changing ourselves.At this point in my life, I have a ""good job"" and financial security, but I still experience horrible depression and that underlying feeling that im a failure and living a ""meaninglessness existence"". I have come to find that the only time I really feel ""alive"", or any feeling remotely resembling happiness is when I am either on drugs, or when I am helping people and making a difference. The latter of those two has actually improved my life, and I am hoping that as a depression community, we can motivate eachother to help re-direct our sadness to further causes that are meaningful to us, and hopefully squash our cynicism.

"[F17] I really need someone to listen This is a throw-away, because I don't want anyone in my personal life to see this. Let me preface this by saying I've been diagnosed with bipolar tendencies (i guess you can't diagnose bipolar disorder until you're 18), severe depression, chronic anxiety and body dysmorphia. I've been hospitalized for a suicide attempt almost two years ago, and I've struggled with self harm since fourth grade. I was bullied relentlessly throughout elementary and middle school. Thankfully, i've been clean for a year, and after the hospital I got on medication and things started to get better for a while. My senior year has been great so far but it's starting to get bad again. I used to be a social smoker, but now I'm completely dependent on marijuana for everything. I'm not hungry unless I smoke and I can't fall asleep unless I smoke. I need it to get through the day. I can't go to college, because I can't afford it and my mom says she can't consign on a loan for me. I totally understand that too, because if my dad were to die she'd be in trouble and in tens of thousands of dollars in debt. I'm just sad because I want to go away like all of my friends but I can't. My dad is most likely going to lose his job soon apparently too, which is going to put us in poverty. My mom and dad fight all the time, and hate each other. They've both talked about getting a divorce to me exclusively. I pretend like it doesn't bother me, but it does. My dad is addicted to prescription painkillers, and locks himself in his room the minute he gets home. He comes to my choir concerts, plays, and musicals but leaves almost immediately after it starts, which hurts me a lot. I pretend like I don't care about that either. The thing that hurts me the most now is my dog was put down today. She was my first dog. I was allergic to dogs when I was way younger. I grew out of it and it took so long to find her, because my mom was set on picking the perfect dog for us. We found her, and now she's gone. I was the one who stayed in the room with her, because my mom couldn't do it. I pet and comforted her while she died. I've never had to cope with someone dying before, and it's so hard. She was just a dog, but I still loved her so much. I want her back so bad. My problems are so minor compared to some people's, but I'm so sad right now. I don't know what to do. This is the first time in a while that I've wanted to kill myself, but I don't want to go down that road again. I just don't know how to cope anymore.

"My Boyfriend Talks Daily About Suicide -- Won't Go To Hospital Hi guys, I'm really just at a loss for what to do. I am absolutely gutted.  My boyfriend has pretty serious depression and is in dire need of help. I won't be able to get him in to see a therapist until next week. He has recently become quite down on his luck and he hates himself for it. His anxiety stopped him from going to work, and he was fired. He has a new job now, but he hates it as it is a factory job where he works 60 hrs/week.   Any time I try to help him find a new job so he can leave this job, he completely panics and shuts down and I can't say anything or else he yells. It has gotten so bad recently that I dread waking up in the morning because of the psychological warfare with him. He will do things like saying he wants to self-harm, or he is going to jump out of the car while I am driving.  I have been with him for years, through thick and thin. I have had to bring him to the hospital before, and he did get better for a few months. He told me tonight he doesn't want me to pick him up from work, and that he wasn't going to come home. At this point I feel completely lost, and I know calling the police won't help.  I feel trapped and I need to get out for my own health, but I am deathly terrified he is going to kill himself if I leave. He told me I am the only thing holding him back from killing himself. I'm scared. He is such a good person when he isn't feeling this constant depression. I don't know how to get him to understand we just want to help him. He shuts me down every single day, and it hurts knowing he has given up on himself.   What can I do to help him until he can see his therapist next week?

"Finally got a job, but don't really care. So, finally after about 10-11 months, I got a job. The job isn't a bad one. Quite the opposite, actually.   They specifically hired me saying that they weren't looking for someone to just stick for a year and move on; they wanted to hire someone and essentially keep them/train them eventually up to management level in the course of hopefully a year or two depending how well I take it. I said yes... though, mostly out of seizing a good opportunity.  I'm not happy, or excited. I just don't care, really.  &amp;nbsp;  First and foremost, I'm a minimalist. The urgency of ""I need to save and buy a house"", or ""I need a secure career/future"", etc.. is non-existent in my life. Everything I own could fit in a van, and there would still be space left. I'm not exaggerating. I've even contemplated living in one; build some insulation to the walls, lay out some flooring, and call it home. I'd be absolutely 100% comfortable.  Anyway~  My point is I actually have no reason to be taking this opportunity. The only thing that really ran through my head was ""I'll probably kick myself in the ass in the future for not taking this"". Considering this is a job that'll eventually lead to a solid annual salary within essentially no time, and requires no degrees or fancy stuff, it was kinda hard to say no.  But it was also kinda hard to say yes.  I don't have an endgame. I don't have a goal. At best, the closest thing to a goal that came to mind was ""Eh, I'd probably get back into riding, and buy myself a motorcycle or something"". That was it. My mind literally blanks after that. Nothing else is there.  &amp;nbsp;  I'm not suicidal. I don't go to sleep hoping that I'll never wake up again (though I wouldn't be upset by it), and I don't wake up upset that I'm alive for another day in life. If I had to describe how I feel right now...  Everything is in a very, very quiet limbo.  It's a very passive depression.  &amp;nbsp;  The best way I can summarize it is that this world has so much ""noise"", and it's exhausting for me. I get exhausted just from thinking about it. I wish people could just relax, and stop stirring so much motion around. It's always been like this for my entire life. I'm so tired. Everything/everyone has to move around with such haste, but all I want to do is stop. I just want to appreciate the colors. I want to laugh. I want to be happy.  But in this world, you *can't* be happy looking at the colors.  &amp;nbsp;  *You just.. can't.*  ",finally got job not really care so finally month got job job not bad one quite opposite actually specifically hired saying not looking just stick year on wanted hire essentially themtrain eventually management level course hopefully year depending it said yes though seizing good opportunity not happy excited just not care really ampnbsp foremost minimalist urgency i need save buy house i need secure careerfuture etc nonexistent life fit van space left not exaggerating contemplated living one build insulation wall lay flooring home absolutely comfortable anyway point actually reason taking opportunity thing really ran head i probably kick as future not taking this considering job eventually lead solid annual salary essentially time requires degree fancy stuff kinda hard say no kinda hard say yes not endgame not goal best closest thing goal came mind eh probably riding buy motorcycle something it mind literally blank that there ampnbsp not suicidal not sleep hoping wake though not upset it not wake upset alive day life feel right now very quiet limbo passive depression ampnbsp best way summarize world noise exhausting me exhausted just thinking it wish people just relax stop stirring motion around like entire life tired everythingeveryone haste want stop just want appreciate color want laugh want happy world cannot happy looking color ampnbsp you just cannot,0.39706772565841675,0.4131782650947571,0.4041595458984375

"Just venting Not sure the general gist of where this post is going but I just kind of want to write down my thoughts. I tend to feel better after I do so. Maybe along with that I can have the added bonus of affecting somebody else in a positive way with what I say or that someone else understands what I'm saying.   I'm alone as I type this. I'm sure many people who frequent this sub would describe themselves in that way. I feel over the years I've been getting more and more depressed. I was depressed when in my teens then I hit a lull in my 20s where I just didn't care about much and put things out of mind. Now, I seem to be at a combination of both. A kind of dead, feel nothing type of feeling mixed in with depression. I've been getting angrier as well. Bitter and resentful. I feel like when I was a teen I just thought strongly that I wasn't very great in the general sense. I feel like I now know that to be true. After enough life experience and enough time with yourself you start to see who and what you are.   Needless to say I don't like who I am. Maybe you don't either. I'm not as strong, wise, caring, compassionate, friendly, hard-working, courageous, generous, et fuckin cetera that I'd like. ""Well, why don't you change?""  Cause I clearly don't fuckin want to.   Maybe I enjoy being depressed? Because obviously I've laid out terms, so to speak, for me to be depressed. Not courageous, hard enough working, kind etc etc. Yet, I don't do shit about it. So why complain as if I'm depressed because of it? I think that's where the day to day numb feeling comes in. It's like ""I am this way. I don't like being this way. I don't change being this way. Why tf are you even upset?""   I really don't feel I deserve what I have in my life. Like the organ donor program I feel I'd want to give my body to someone else. Maybe they can make better use of my fully functional legs. My vision. Ever see those people do an absolute fuck ton of things with their life? Those people who are so driven to accomplish a b c d e f g... Every day of their life and they only have 1 limb? Are blind? Live in abject poverty?  I have NONE of these fucking hurdles. I, in fact, don't have anything anyone would legitimately call a hurdle in life and yet I feel depressed.   It's probably justified that I feel this way. I don't do anything to try and feel better and I don't capitalize on advantages I have in my life to make things better. To grow as a person. I don't do that for myself let alone for other people. And yet I want to have success.. I want to have profound love. Meaning and purpose. What a joke Just wish I could hit the fast forward button on this shit and get through with it. Oh right.. There's suicide. But even that holds it's own unique stigma to it. Next to no one would recommend you do that. It's not an ideal solution. So on and so forth. But you kind of have to admit that those that do go through with it... It's as if you can't question them. You can't question their pain. Can't question their sense of guilt or anguish or depression and sadness. They solidified it and made it real moreso than practically anyone could ever do when alive.   Sometimes I wonder if those that commit suicide do so because it's either a) the only perceived way out of their grief or b) that it effectively proves to others beyond a shadow of a doubt what kind of hell they had been living through in the years leading up to doing it.  You can never question someone who killed themselves as to whether their pain was real. Not just in the sense that they're no longer around to ask but that no one would ask what everyone inherently knows. Of course they felt pain. I feel that might be suicides greatest allure. It effectively puts a stamp on your sadness as legitimate.  I've thought about it a lot throughout my life. I don't think I'd ever have the stones to do it. Maybe my life or state of mind just isn't that bad. Not yet anyways.

"My Story - There is hope. **TRIGGER WARNING - includes graphic language.**  Hi there, first time posting. I see a lot of posts from high school/college aged people, and being through that myself, all I want to do is reach out and hug them and tell them how special they are. Instead of writing all the typical stuff ""you're so young,"" ""you'll grow out of it,"" ""go see a therapist/take medication,"" etc., I thought I'd share how depression affected me mentally &amp; emotionally and my journey through college. I got to the point where depression was life threatening, and I had given up all hope. I was lucky because my mom (and my dad) were 100% committed to my recovery, even if it meant I deeply hated and resented them at the time. I realize not everyone has that, but in sharing my story, I hope that maybe certain aspects can resonate with people going through the same thing I did and help them not feel so alone.  **How Depression Affected Me**\- trigger warning  It finds a way to connect to memories. To healthy feelings. And twist them into something dark. It craves uncertainty and pain and tells you that you deserve only that. It makes you seek out the deepest crevices of your mind and get lost. To the point where you don’t even know what’s you and what’s the sickness anymore. It almost feels good to indulge because it’s so familiar. We’re taught that enduring pain is somehow one of the most beautiful things a person can do. But what if that pain isn’t real?  In college, I was so afraid of being alone that I wouldn't want guys to leave my room. And there were a fair amount of them. I'd beg them to stay longer and tell them I had separation anxiety. As long as I was focusing on them, I didn't have to focus on me. I justified it by saying that I was 'enjoying' my college experience and 'exploring' my sexuality.   I thought it was normal to not see color, to not ever be excited, to want to drink until my body was as numb as my mind. I wondered how other people could live life with relative stability and thought I was weak for not knowing what they knew. To me, it seemed like common knowledge that life was pointless and ultimately a waste of time. I didn't understand why I was the only one that couldn't cope with that fact. When I was home over a break, I told my mom that I had accepted I would never be happy. When my mom said she was hurt by that, it didn't even occur to me why. I thought I had learned the secret that everyone else knew, the secret that let them go to class or work or see friends or make friends.  Even though by the end of my freshman year, I was cutting myself and promiscuous and drank with the purpose of blacking out so I could have even just an hour of relief from myself, I couldn't admit that I had depression. I thought I felt and acted like that because I was lazy, stupid, slutty, weak. Every semester, my grades slipped a little (or a lot) at a time, and my parents grew more and more disappointed in me. I had been a star student in elementary school, frequently getting the highest scores in class and got into every top middle &amp; high school. I felt like such a failure. At this point, my parents sent me to a very expensive therapist, which ultimately was a waste of money because all I did was bend the truth to hide every aspect of myself and life. I don't think I could have even been honest even if I wanted to at this point.  The first semester of my junior year, these thoughts grew too heavy. I didn't want to be there anymore. I wanted to be nowhere, not awake, not asleep, not alive, not dead. I spent my time with people that encouraged all my doubts, and I pushed away people that cared. I rarely went to class and even if I did, I scraped by on the assignments. I lived for the moments of escape when I could go to parties and drink and hook up with guys, no matter how repelled I was by them. Outside of those few hours of escape, I couldn't sleep. I never went to the cafeteria with friends or even to get a real meal. I only ate Lean Cuisines that my parents had bought me at the beginning of the year. When I ran out, I ate solely Pizza Rolls and peanut M&amp;Ms. I didn't do laundry once in those few months and barely took showers. The only time I put any effort into my personal appearance was when I went to a party because all I wanted was to be perceived as ""carefree"" and ""sexy,"" not the lazy slob that I thought I was. Even then, I wore wildly inappropriate clothing compared to what everyone else at my college wore - one time a girl yelled out to me, ""You're going to get raped!"" Another said judgmentally to a friend, ""She's not wearing pants."" (I was wearing sequined booty shorts, okay). My only happy moments that semester were with a boy that then tried to sexually assault me with a visiting alumnus. His excuse was that he wanted to get into the alumnus' frat by impressing that brother. When he tried to apologize the next morning, I told him he shouldn't apologize. I was so disconnected from my body, I didn't even view it as mine anymore. After that, I didn't blame him and still spent most of my 'free' time with him. (Free meaning when I wasn't laying on my bed trying to gather enough strength to even leave my room, going to a party or the rare occasion I went to class or very very rarely attended a sorority event.)  My last night at that school, my theory that I had borderline personality disorder was weighing on me. I had been thinking about it for a couple of weeks after I had finally figured out that my behavior and thoughts were not the typical college experience, thanks to my extremely honest roommate &amp; sorority sister. She told me that other girls in the sorority thought I was trying to ""fuck with their guy friends"" and slept with too many people. I tried to go to the student health center earlier that day. When I stated, ""I think I have borderline personality disorder,"" they just said, ""What do you want us to do?"" The only action they were equipped to take was to call the on-duty counselor who had to drive 40 minutes to get to campus. When I told her about my self harm and drinking and promiscuity she replied, ""How does that make you different than any other student?"" This further cemented my past notion that I was just weak: the numbness and loneliness - the desire to feel anything at all - was normal, and I just had a huge character flaw by not having the strength to be 'normal.'   That night I got wasted and tried to swallow a whole bottle of caffeine pills at my friend's house. My intention was to induce a heart attack. He was one of the only people that I knew understood what I was feeling, but I never got a chance to tell him how close to the edge I was since his freshman girlfriend and two of her friends were with him that night. Not that it was his responsibility, but I just wanted confirmation that something wasn't right with me. While I was at his house, I tried to stay true to my 'carefree,' 'fun' person that I tried so hard portray while his girlfriend and her friends complimented my shirt and hair. It made me feel like such a fraud. Towards the end of the night, after I had swallowed those pills, my friend tried to get me to throw them up and then drove me to my dorm where I couldn't even find my room. I stumbled around and ran into the RA that had just gotten out of the shower and clung to him. I was scared and confused and felt so alone. I eventually got to my room and started cutting my already scarred wrist with baby scissors. I tried to cut into my femoral artery with those scissors as well, which was entirely unsuccessful. I settled for cutting my knee. At that moment, campus safety knocked on the door. I kept calm when they asked their usual questions, ""Have you been drinking tonight?,"" etc., until they asked me to show them my wrists. That's when I panicked. Started screaming and crying uncontrollably. They escorted me to their office. I later learned one of the officers asked my roommate if I slept around. While I was incoherently yelling, an officer handed me a phone. It was my mom, and I cried that a death of a young man I knew in high school was my fault, and that I could have done something. (Background: His death wasn't my fault in any conceivable way. He OD'ed. I barely knew him &amp; didn't even know he was an addict, but I had a huge crush on him at the time and never acted on it. Through my warped logic, if I had been braver and talked to him, I could have 'saved' him.)   The next day she was at my school ready to pick me up. She had flown on the next available flight to get to me. When I returned home, I went through months of therapy and psychiatry and yoga and meditation all arranged all by my mom. In the beginning, I was okay. Broken down and exhausted but seemingly on the mend. On some level, I was relieved that I had finally been diagnosed with something (went from depression to bipolar II to a depressive mood disorder). I worked really hard with my therapist to understand my guilt, disgust and trauma, which ironically had been entirely driven by ways I tried to cope with my depression. However, fully expecting to go back to college for the next semester, I was informed that I was not allowed to return yet. When I chose to leave in the middle of the semester, the dean didn't share the information that they had never let a student return from health leave until after six months of treatment. I had withdrawn from all my classes and sacrificed a semester's worth of my parents money thinking that I would be returning shortly and only a semester behind.  After that initial blow, my parents eventually gave me more freedom, I met and got involved with a guy that got me more into substances. He was going through issues of his own, which is why I connected with him. One morning, my parents tried to wake me up but couldn't. No need to go into further detail, but it was one step forward and two steps back (I no longer wanted to be 'nowhere' but was now using... alcohol... frequently). Despite alcohol being one of my main coping mechanisms, I was fortunate not to develop any dependencies or addictions.  A handful of months later, after my parents had taken away my phone and forced me to be supervised by them every night, I was accepted into a local university. I had also found a new therapist and psychiatrist. Their words stuck to me: 1) ""Depression sucks and it most likely will be with you forever but there are ways of treating it."" and 2) ""You get to a point in your recovery where you can't blame your depression anymore. You just have to stand up and do your homework/go to your job/go to class."" I was also lucky enough to have a couple professors that understood on a basic level what I was going through. One told me to show up to class no matter how miserable I was. I didn't bother to explain that depression wasn't about being miserable, but from there on out I did everything within my emotional power to go to class, even if I had drank before (that happened a couple times) or didn't participate (happened almost every time). I ended up getting a C or D in the class, but I take that as a win since I easily could have failed. Another professor asked student services to reach out to me after I hadn't shown up to class a couple weeks in a row. I learned there will be a lot of people that don't get it and don't want to get it, but the one or two that do make all the difference in the world.  Throughout my time at the new university, there were a lot of ups (meeting a close friend and actually making personal connections with people, excelling at the courses in my major) and downs (failing multiple classes and having to proactively withdraw due to 'special circumstances,' finishing an entire bottle of wine in an hour, crying and writing gibberish about how guilty I felt then inviting some random 30 year old I had met on Tinder over to my dorm room), but slowly I was piecing it together. I eventually got an on-campus job, then a full time internship then a full-time job.  While I'm not perfect these days, I've been at a job I never would have dreamed of for the past two and half years and have gotten a promotion.  Still, sometimes when the depression gets the best of me, I think that’s who I really am. This broken, beaten down person that's ashamed of basically her entire young adulthood. I fear that I don't want anything of substance. That I can’t find anything of substance. That I don't even know what I want. No path. No passion. When it gets that bad, it takes every ounce of strength I have to fight it.   Even on good days, I can feel like it's in the back my mind. I'm terrified that it will come back, and I won't be able to control it. I'll give in to the thoughts that say I'm not good enough. You'll never be good enough. Everything you've dared to want will slip through your fingers, and you won't even know. All I do is think about how far I've come from that girl who swallowed a dozen caffeine pills. That girl who  thought she'd never be happy. And it gives me just enough strength to deny those feelings and smile.  I hope this wasn't too personal, but I wanted to be as raw and honest as possible.

While sobbing with my hands in my face, trying to figure out who would take care of my son and my unpaid debt, I looked up to see my cat staring at me.

My step dad raped me for 8 years, since i was 8 years old until a few months ago. Why didn't i tell anyone? why couldn't i speak up? ..... because he told me they wouldn't believe me, it would ruin the family. my mom would hate me. well he was right about one thing it did ruin the family, but they did believe me and my mom still loves me. it ruined the family for a better cause. i don't ever have to see or talk to my step dad ever again. so why do i still feel this way?. ...... because my mom still loves him, she is torn between us and she never really took my side and helped me through this. For 8 years of my life i had to pretend to be happy and normal. i had to push everything in the back off my mind and cry every night. i had to wonder why he was doing this to me, i thought he loved me. He had been my father since i was 2. how could he betray me like this and hurt me. how could he take away my childhood. from that i learned that in the end everything will be bad and nothing is ever what it seems. I had to grow up so fast, i had to realize how the world really was. i had to lie and keep secrets. I learned to hide everything even myself, even my soul. It took me 8 years of pain and suffering. of growing, thinking and knowing. of wishing, hoping and dreaming. to finally speak up. To finally show myself. to make my soul vulnerable. To cry a million tears that i could never cry before. but now that i can be me and show myself, i don't like myself. All the pain and misery. the secrets and lies. the memories and nightmares. this all was building up inside of me for 8 years. Now its showing and I'm a bitter and sad person. I was on the verge of exploding and now its taking me along time to get all this build up out of me. I've never really discovered who i really am. I pretended for 8 years and now all the hurt and bitterness is showing. When and if that's all gone what will i really be like? i can't even picture myself being happy or excited. I can't picture my self in color when everything around me including me is gray and bleak. Will anyone ever love me?

Basically I joined this forum so I can realize for myself I'm not the only one with problems. My depression has gotten a lot better over the years as certain situations got better too; I have a loving boyfriend whom I have been with for 14 months now, which I'm extremely sure that he has helped me. Next year, well in the fall I will be moving away to college, which I actually think will be a good thing for me. I am also a cheerleader at my school, which doesn't help with my depression I am constantly under pressure about that. I'm also a dancer, my parents have this thing where they like to find every little thing I do wrong. It seems as if nothing I do is good enough or right. Which has lead to my wanting to be alone and not eating. With the stress of dance and cheerleading and my parents constantly telling me I'm fat has lead me to only eat once or twice every other day. I know it is not healthy and I know it is not good, but I personally think its better then cutting and better then trying to overdose on pain killers and every other pill in the house.

My biggest struggle is with my family, the only person that is there for me is my Step Dad... No one else seems to get it? My mum is always telling me to not keep secrets and that I should tell her how I feel coz if she doesn't know everything how can she help me? But I don't want to have to tell her everything (Because she says hurtful things back at me once I tell her and she won't even hug me) but if I don't tell her she makes me feel so bad and so I do tell her how I feel and then she shoots me down! She tells me to snap out of it and just get on with it and to stop being so stupid... every time I talk to my mum I cry coz she hurts me so much! And then she gets all down coz she makes me down which makes me down!!! I JUST CAN'T WIN! These days I only have to say something like ""oh that sucks, no milk"" and she tells me to get over it or get lost! And all I did was say something. I can't even really explain it? It's like she won't be happy until she hears what she wants to hear... I have tried talking to her about the way she makes me feel and all I get is ""that's just life"" or she starts telling me how she buys me things and that I should feel like this coz she has brought me things and let me use her car, etc, etc... The other day I was haven a really bad day and I asked mum for a hug and all she could say is ""No..."" she says she doesn't want to feed my sadness BUT instead of doing happy things she just tells me to get over it! And she won't listen when I say stop...She even told me to pack my bags and leave once if I didn't get over whatever it was I was going through! If I didn't have my step dad I wouldn't be here today... I love him more than the world and he is the only one that shows me that he loves me... I just need help...

"I don't know how I'm gonna do it. I'm 27. I lived alone, had my own stuff, my own life. I gave up everything to join the military. I went to live with my parents again until I left for boot camp.   I went to boot camp. I got hurt and it stopped my training. I was heartbroken. I had to come home and move back in with my parents because I had nothing to my name.   Now, I'm stuck with them for at least the next 3 months. I've been back from boot camp since late September. They want me to show them my bank account once a week. They have an amount of my own money that I earn that I can spend every week. I want to leave, but my credit is crap and it won't allow me to get my own place just yet as most places do a credit check. I'm getting my own car here shortly.  I recently had a really bad breakup with a woman who I had spent almost 3 years of my life with. I'm heartbroken and absolutely lost. She was my world. She told me I was her world.

I don't have any control over my own life. My folks don't want rent, but they control every aspect of the rest of my life instead and every time I walk in the house, I can feel the tension and I get talked to like a child whenever I don't follow their rules.

"Emotionally offline I shouldn’t be writing this, I have three final projects due in the next couple of days and I haven’t started on any of them. But I don’t have the energy to even get started...I don’t know what to do. It’s too late to ask for extensions but I don’t want to fail my classes (that mean nothing to me). Whatever...I guess I’ll turn out fine because I was doing well grade-wise up to this point, but it’s gonna be fucking painful.   Over the course of the last couple of weeks, I feel as if I’ve gone emotionally offline. I feel like a shell of myself. I’m not sure what happened. I think the real downturn started when I was walking on campus two weeks ago and saw my ex-girlfriend of a few months with her new boyfriend, but that’s definitely not the only thing that is bothering me. It might have been a death-by-a-thousand-cuts situation because if I take an itinerary of what’s going on in my life, there isn’t much there.   If my life had a thesis statement, it’d be that I have nothing to look forward to. Hardly any aspect of my life can bring me out of the apathy that I seem to be stuck in every day. I don’t find any of my classes enjoyable, and now the thought of doing it as a career is starting to give me nightmares. I have “friends” but I don’t much enjoy hanging out with them, and overall, any attempts to meet new people just seems to amount to nothing. I have no dating life, and I’m still admittedly stuck on the aforementioned ex-girlfriend (who has completely moved on) that I dated for seven months and have been broken up for the same length. All I can think about is that if she saw me today, barely able to get out of bed and go to school, I’m also certain she would feel even more justified in breaking up with me. I keep thinking about this new person she’s dating and in what ways he is likely a complete upgrade. I don’t even know what their situation is, I am just inventing scenarios in my head. I need to stop that. Fuck.   The only thing I have is that I’m in fairly good shape and my GPA is 3.8 (although that’s certain to go down after this week, which scares the ever-living shit out of me because it feels like the only real thing I can put on my resume). I’m also fairly consistent with working out; it’s not a huge part of my life, but holy shit, if I didn’t do it I can’t imagine how depressed I’d be. Right now, all of the emotional energy I have for the day goes to getting myself to the gym at the least.   With my career, I’m interested in how technology affects people and society; like internet addiction, social media, artificial intelligence, etc. That is kind of what drew me to my major in the first place, which is User Experience Design. However, I do little of that (the research side of things, which includes talking to people and learning their stories, then coming up with conclusions based on that data on how you can improve a digital service) and more the design/development side of things (like visual/graphic/UI design and web development, just building the fucking thing), which I’m good with, but it both stresses me out and bores the shit out of me. I think it’d be fulfilling to be a UX Researcher for a popular social app just because I would be able to study how people interact with it. Or do that for a consultancy/agency or something, and start a blog/podcast about technology+society. I kind of largely detest the Silicon Valley tech utopianism that’s sweeping the country, it seems to be making everyone I know (and myself) unhappy in really subtle ways, but it’s become almost a cult of sorts. I could turn what I learn about user research to that.   But if I want to keep pursuing this path, I have to keep doing the parts that make me depressed (design and coding) for a significant amount of time so I’ve just kind of lost motivation to try at all. I know I should just push through, but I’ve pushed through my whole life and honestly, I’m tired of fucking pushing. Everyone is telling me to keep moving forward because I show talent in it (the design/code side of user experience) and it’s lucrative but fuck man I can only do this for so long. I’d rather use my creativity on music or writing. I have three internship interviews this week which isn’t good to have hanging over my head when I’m asking all of these questions.   I constantly wonder if there is a better, more fulfilling, and less depressing route to the other side of all of this.   The social life issue is more simple, I don’t even want to write about it. I need to be more vulnerable to people and go outside my comfort zone, and that’s gonna take a ton of work no matter how you spin it. The first part of this video with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem is basically my entire life in a nutshell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYCz06bS380. Ditto on the dating life, although that might be a little more complicated. I’ve only even felt attracted to one person since my breakup, so I guess there is more going underneath the surface there. I can’t imagine dating anyone in my current state, but man, the ever-present loneliness really drains me.   Isn’t it ironic though? I want to go into a career where I study people all day, yet I struggle to actually build and establish friendships. I’m like a people’s introvert, it makes no sense.   I seem to use daydreaming and fantasizing as an escape. I spend an embarrassing amount of mental time each day imagining myself as a frontman for a successful band; I really look up to someone like Father John Misty, I feel we have similar sensibilities on a lot of things. And there is just something about pouring your emotions and thoughts into an album, performing it live and connecting with people through that authenticity, that really makes me regret not taking learning music seriously up until this point in my life. I could really use that sort of emotional release right now. Same with writing, when school isn’t consuming every moment of my waking day I like to read a lot, so I’d like to write a book one day on something I care about.   I’m reading what I wrote and it’s kind of frustrating. I clearly have dreams and desires, why can’t I manifest them into anything that makes me remotely proud of myself? Like am I even depressed? I feel like way too many people here have it worse than me for me to complain about my “depression.” Maybe I’m just a shitty person looking for an excuse not to do anything useful with my life.   I’m just trying to make it to Friday. My favorite band is coming to my city and it’s the only thing I’m looking forward to. Its the only reason I am ignoring the thoughts of suicide...I need a break from all this bullshit.   I’m gonna schedule a doctor’s appointment today to get a blood panel done to see if anything’s happening there. I might look into SAD because depression always seems to historically hit me around this time (although this time last year was the happiest I’ve ever been, so I’m not exactly sure). I already see a therapist weekly but I might look for a new one because I’m not sure if we’re making any progress. I’m gonna try to get back into meditation if I can find any time.

"I'm actually feeling a little bit like a fraud at the moment, because I've read so many different topics today and realized that there are people who have suffered far more than I have. I've joined this site, to start to try and get some help for myself and to talk about the things that have caused me to feel like this over the last few years. My doctor has told me that I'm depressed and prescribed tablets, but I refuse to believe this and have not taken them. I know that this is wrong, but I hate the idea of being labeled depressed. Before I went to university, I was happy, adventurous, nothing could keep me down. I was in a fantastic relationship, but then I moved into halls, in a flat with six others, who I absolutely adored. One of them in particular, who I fell in love with. Little did I know that he had also fallen for me in the same way, but we were both so shy and I was in a relationship, that neither of us did anything about it ...... until we moved into a house together in our second year with 3 others. This is when everything went wrong. We were always close, really close in fact, and I admitted to him that I kept getting urges to kiss him, hold him and never let him go. He felt the same way as I did, but still nothing was done by either of us. Then one evening we were both out, getting drunk with friends, we found ourselves alone when we got back to the house and kissed. I've never felt like I did that night since. I didn't care about anything around me. We were the only 2 people in the world at that moment. The next morning, we were both a bit bemused and didn't know what to say / do, so pretended like nothing had happened. The end of term came and we had just moved in to another house with the same people, but were all going home for the summer. I was devastated knowing that we wouldn't see each other until september. I began to resent my boyfriend who I was still with and my family were going through problems because of my father. When september came, I went straight onto my final teaching placement, which meant up at 530 work all day, home, eat ,work and then in bed by 11pm. I was tired all the time and didn't have the energy to go out in the week, but He was always there for me, and yes, we were still pretending like nothing had happened. After the christmas of my final year, I decided to party like never before. It was great, but there was still the issue of him. By now I had been trying to convince myself that I was still in love with my boyfriend, purely because I didn't have the guts to leave him and be on my own. How pathetic was that. Anyway, we went out to the union for a major drinking session, danced like a couple, felt like a couple, got back to the house and one thing led to another. We ended up sleeping together in his room, he initiated it. It was amazing. However the next day we were so confused that we didn't speak for 2 days, until I told him how I really felt. That I had been in love with him since my first year, but couldn't do anything about it, that I was going mad inside because I wanted him so much. He returned my feelings. From then on, we were inseparable, but to anyone who saw us together, we were just 2 very very close friends, who lived in each others' pockets. We were having an affair of sorts and living a lie, but we found comfort in each other and couldn't let it go. I know how wrong it was, believe me I do, and I would be devastated if it ever happened to me. We left university in the june of 2004. It was the worst time of my life. I felt like I was losing part of me, and was never going to get it back. Before we left and before the lie really started, I had agreed to move in with my boyfriend in leeds for his final year. I didn't want to do this anymore, but was too chicken to say no, so this went ahead and for the last year, july 04 until now, I have been living with my boyfriend. Things have not been good and I have still been seeing Him (from university) as often as I can. The most recent one was a couple of days ago. We have both joked about running away, children, marriage, but neither of us has got the guts to do anything. It is so wrong and has made my life so difficult, putting on a brave face for friends and family, pretending that I'm happy all of the time. I don't think I can do it much longer. One last thing, while all of this was going on in my life, my dad was causing mayhem at home. I was being pushed and pulled between the 2 people that I thought could get through anything and that were truly in love. How wrong can you be. I was like a piece of meat being fought over by 2 animals. They constantly bitched about each other to me, leaving me with no - one to talk to. I found myself being dragged further and further down in to a pit which I can't get out of. I'm in love with Him, but will not leave my boyfriend for fear of being alone, I resent my father for what he has done, I resent my mother for being callous, there is no - one that I have told this to over the past 4 years, nobody who I felt that I could really trust. I don't know what to do anymore. I cry at the smallest thing, hate things changing at all, but most of all, I can't see the point of going on anymore. I just want these feelings to end. My one savior has been my work, teaching children. caring for others and helping them make the most of their lives makes me feel like I'm doing something worthwhile.

"I would love to talk about dreams. Only thing is for every dream, there can be a hundred interpretations. Or so has been my experience. I always say that I will keep paper and pen next to me at night, so when I have a dream I want to remember (like last night)... I'll write it down so I won't forget. But I don't do this because when I wake up I think I can remember...no problem! After all, a lot of these dreams are so profound that how could I possibly forget them... guess what??? I almost always forget the words that meant so much to me in the dream. I remember the subject matter, but it's the words many times that I want to remember. So here goes my dream from last night (or early this morning)... A little background first for those who don't know or remember who I am... my mother died quite suddenly from her leukemia in April 2004. We were at odds with each other at the time. I started taking care of my elderly father at the time and he died this past August 2005. I've been wanting to dream about my mother and feel her presence and love since she died. I've only had a few dreams about her, maybe 4... And they have all been upsetting, never ""nice feeling"" dreams. Last night I had a dream of my mother. She was pregnant and ready to deliver her baby. She looked younger (she was almost 82 at her death) but in the dream ""we"" knew she was older like she was alive today. She said ""I'm ok now I'm going to have a baby At least I think this is what she said. My dad was in my dream as was my dad's cousin, who is also deceased. My mother's cousin-in-law was in the dream and she was sobbing. This same woman was crying out of control at my mother's funeral. We were at a hotel in Disneyland. Ok everyone.

"Is it okay to be tired of pretending everything is okay to spark optimism? So I have alot going on in my life -- too much for me to want to spend five hours writing about it for this post. What's bothering me is that lately, things have been weighing down HARD. My patience is paper thin from years of abuse and I feel like in these last few months, I'm receding into myself because I don't have patience for even reasonable flaws in other people. I'm tired of being stepped on and dealing with the hand I've been dealt in life (I am CLAWING my way out of poverty ALONE, caused by a narcissistic parent kicking me out and attempting to kill me at 17 -- just made 21). I finally told my boyfriend today, not mincing any words, that I'm so fucking tired of being optimistic. That I'm tired of pretending anything is going to be fine because alot of the times I feel like it won't. ""Faking it till you make it"" has worked for me in the past, definitely, but being optimistic to KEEP myself from being depressing/depressed is not fucking working for me. It's idiotic. It's not that I think things are 100% pointless -- I'm working on a set of skills right now to get myself out of my minimum wage job to get a much better one.   &amp;nbsp;  But I'm just exhausted from trying to not worry other people and not expressing how fucking done I am with everything. Is this normal? Is this healthy? Like I said, not giving up. I'm working forward. I just feel like the fake optimism is an extra step and a formality at this point and honestly complaining today made me feel better, not going to lie, as I do my best to not do that because I feel like I'm ""pushing myself on others"" (my situation is so bleak that people almost never know what to say in response anyway because there is nothing close to an immediate solution). But I feel angry and spiteful that people who have been given everything or that can recieve assistance from family telling me how I have to ""perk up"" because It's ""what they do when things are hard"" when their ""hard"" is ""I stayed up all the time in college to study and it's hard"" vs ""I stay up all the time to study my new skillset AND risk my life every day on a chinese scooter that gives out at times to do deliveries in all of the elements to make a wage that isn't even livable, having one or more panic attacks a day because of dangerous drivers"".  &amp;nbsp;  I also feel bad because my SO is always trying to be an optimist. He's somehow perfected this even being depressed himself. Sometimes that bleeds through but he's usually hyper optimistic and it's exhausting. We've gotten in arguments in the past when he was less acquainted with my depression because if I wasn't immediately cheered up by him making jokes while I'm crying to make me laugh (let me work through my emotions, damn... It works sometimes but not ALL the time, seriously), he'd get insulted and take it personally that a single joke was not enough to change my outlook on life and fix all my issues. I feel kind of like I got a little snippy with him when I complained earlier and kept cutting him off and telling him how hopeless I felt and telling him, emotionlessly, ""I just don't care to be optimistic. I don't give a fuck. What's that going to do? I'm already tired, it's just going to make me more tired"" because I had a feeling that that was where he was going to go with it. I feel bad because he's just trying to help. But I am so fucking tired. So tired. I have a hard time doing anything if I don't think it has a point (Even if I hate a job, I'm still getting paid, and there is therefore a point to it) and I just didn't see  the point of doing all this. I think I do to make him happy and worry less about me. But I'm so upset that I don't have the capacity right now to do more things to emotionally keep him comfortable. That's stupid.

"Help: ruining my University course Second year student here in a UK university.

So at the time I felt terrible, but looking back on it from second year I had some good memories.

"No one has a monopoly on suffering.  We keep living our lives because depression is pain and illness is suffering, but both don't happen without something happening to us. It is at these times that we are changing in some way...Suffering can give us greater empathy and understanding.  It can strip away all the other stuff.  So many say they will always be depressed ... that may or may not be the case but everyone has right to live their lives ... suffering included.  However, there is a vast difference between simply suffering from depression and finding the courage to live with long term / cyclical depression.  You can, learn to live with depression.  It may profoundly change your life ... take much away from you, but you can learn to live with it.  Long term depression isn't static ... like any illness, it changes.  But we know depression is different because it so cruelly takes away our hope of a brighter future.  But be stubborn and it will change again. To state in a forum like this, that you want to end it all is a big responsibility to place on the shoulders of other people.  It hands the possibility of that personal choice on to others .... which is unfair. Genuine suffering can bring more empathy and awareness of the plight of others in similar situations. There are times when i feel like ending my life and the thoughts nudge at me constantly but I recognize them now for what they are: the depression talking.  With each episode I have learnt new ways to try and tag these thoughts.  Ultimately ... the illness is happening to me / the thoughts happen to me.  But I would not burden others with the knowledge of their presence.  It is only afterwards that i might mention that i had these constant thoughts, because to tell them in the middle of the depression would only darken their lives as much as the depression is darkening my own. Please think before you make threats of suicide in the chat room or forums.  There is an increasing number of people using this technique of gaining attention but it is unfair.  by all means we can talk about it .... but saying : ""i'm going to do it."" is simply selfish and smacks of attention seeking. Such behavior is destroying the integrity of genuine sufferers of depression in the eyes of so many.  It is eroding the help which is so lacking for so many ... and is probably the reason why the mental health hospital near me is a relic from the 60's and yet the cancer department is brand new and state of the art.

"I found out  I  had depression about 10 years ago. But looking back I had it since i was a teen.  I've tried suicide about 4 times. As you can see that didn't work.  I have 2 kids, one is 21 and the other is 14. I've been married for 11 years this year. They know I have depression, but it's my problem not theirs. I wake up every morning thinking about killing my self and I go to bed thinking about killing myself. I sit around and cry all day. I don't like to leave my house, and I don't unless I really have to. I am overweight, 39, and very alone in this world. My family tries to stay away from me, they don't talk to me unless they have to. My 14 year old is totally afraid of me, I can see it in her eyes. My 21 year old is bipolar, which makes him more screwed up than I am. He throws me into a panic attack every time I get around him. I have been on all of the medications out there, nothing seems to work for me. They just make me sleep a lot. I went to therapy for about 7 years. That really didn't work either.

"Alright, this is a bit weird to explain, but I am having a lot of trouble making this decision so I am going to try and write it down. If anyone has any suggestions or advice to offer I would appreciate it. A while back my brother and I let a stray cat in and fed it, and we got really attached to it. It is probably the most needy animal I have ever met and will sit with people all day, loves it when you pet it, and I really like the cat. I wasn't thinking at the time, but later I realized I needed to pay a pet deposit like the rest of the people in my complex, so I could keep the cat. So my mother called up our landlord's office and they said that we could not have the cat. It seems really unfair to me that everyone else is allowed animals, but for some reason we are not. I don't think there is anything I can do about this and it makes me really sad. We didn't want to get rid of the cat so bad that we decided to hide the cat away, letting it inside only at night, and living in my brother's van in the day while we were looking to see if there was somewhere else we could move to. The problem is, I think I would only barely have enough money to move and I think it would be too risky that my family would lose our assistance if we were to go through with such a thing. Not to mention that I keep my spare money around in the case of emergencies and if something bad were to happen, I wouldn't be able to deal with it financially. So the only option I know of that is left is the animal shelter and I really do not want my cat to be locked up and possibly die alone in a cage. I know that it is getting old and that people take younger cats from animal shelters much more often than older ones. I want my cat to have a good place to live and don't want it to spend its final years in a cage, without loving owners. I am having so much trouble making this decision... I love my cat a lot and want it to be taken care of well and to be happy, but I am endangering my family the longer I try to hide it. My mother and brother keep telling me that it is my decision to make and I just keep procrastinating. So I posted this here because it is making me depressed and stressed out. Are there any options I am leaving out? Do I either have to spend all of my money to move or give it to an animal shelter? They both seem like such terrible options",alright bit weird explain having lot trouble making decision going try write down suggestion advice offer appreciate it brother let stray cat fed it got really attached it probably needy animal met sit people day love pet it really like cat not thinking time later realized needed pay pet deposit like rest people complex cat mother called landlord office said not cat really unfair allowed animal reason not not think make really sad did not want rid cat bad decided hide cat away letting inside night living brother van day looking to problem is think barely money think risky family lose assistance thing not mention spare money case emergency bad happen not able deal financially option know left animal shelter really not want cat locked possibly die cage know getting old people younger cat animal shelter older one want cat good place live not want spend final year cage loving owner having trouble making decision love cat lot want taken care happy endangering family longer try hide it mother brother telling decision make just procrastinating posted making depressed stressed out option leaving out spend money animal shelter like terrible option,0.45776331424713135,0.4913119375705719,0.41775238513946533
"Hey, I guess this is the place to post this. I don't really know if I'm depressed and if I am I'm not sure how to go about getting help for it so I figured you guys would be able to help me out a bit. For the past year and a bit I've been feeling really out of sorts, pretty down and kind of lost in general. I left school in July 2004 and started a year out before I went to university. That's when I started feeling strange and I put it down to (and still believe it was) just a weird kind of feeling when one leaves school and their life changes forever and it's the beginning of being an adult which is a scary time for anyone. Over the year I'd go through different stages where for a few months I'd feel really positive and enjoy spending time with people and then for a few months I'd feel lonely and sad and not go out with friends for months on end. Then I went to university in September 2005 and felt very very sad. I think it was the shock of leaving home, living away from everyone I'd ever known and also the feeling of being back at school. I knew immediately that I'd made a terrible decision starting university, it wasn't what I wanted to be doing with my life and for the 6 weeks I was there I would stay in bed pretty much all day and not eat much. I think I lost about a stone and a half and even now, 3 months after dropping out and moving back home I'm still half a stone lighter than I was last summer. So now I'm back at home and I've started a job cleaning tables in a cafe where I got on with the people I work with and I'm back in the same city as my girlfriend again and things should be ok but I keep dropping into really low moods.  A few weeks ago I thought that maybe it was depression and so I took some tests on the internet with what seem to be the basic questions. I tried to answer as truthfully as possible, you have to understand that depression is not something I want to have, I've known too many silly teenagers who think that having depression makes them interesting to other people and so they exaggerate emotions to try and look sad to find it appealing. So even though I found myself answering questions that I knew were making me seem depressed I answered the anyway because it was the truth. Things like a lowered libido, I find myself wanting to have sex with my girlfriend far far less frequently than I used to and to be honest a lot of the time when I'm having sex I feel that I'm just going through the motions. My sleeping which has always been a little odd has become increasingly erratic and I've found myself thinking about death a lot. To be honest though I thought that everyone thought about death and dying and that it was natural. I fin myself becoming very easily bored with people and situations and where I once used to enjoy writing stories I can't being myself to do it anymore. The worst thing though is the mood swings I have and the low moods I find myself in quite frequently. When I feel like this I don't want to be around anyone or have anyone talk to me and I can't stop myself thinking about bad things that have happened to me or could happen on a personal level and making myself the centre of blame for them. So am I depressed or is it just, as I'm leaning towards, a natural part of growing up and finding myself in the world of work and adulthood and trying to adjust to it. And if I am depressed how do I stop myself being this way? The thought of going to my doctor and sitting there and saying ""I think I'm depressed"" doesn't make much sense to me. I've always thought that with problems of that nature you must be told that you're ill and not decide for yourself that you are. Sorry if this has been very long and poorly punctuated, I wrote it all fairly stream of consciously. Any help at all would be very much appreciated, I'm feeling pretty vulnerable and down right now and don't want to feel this way anymore.",hey guess place post this not really know depressed not sure getting help figured guy able help bit past year bit feeling really sort pretty kind lost general left school july started year went university started feeling strange and believe wa just weird kind feeling leaf school life change forever beginning adult scary time anyone year different stage month feel really positive enjoy spending time people month feel lonely sad not friend month end went university september felt sad think shock leaving home living away known feeling school knew immediately terrible decision starting university not wanted doing life week stay bed pretty day not eat much think lost stone half now month dropping moving home half stone lighter summer home started job cleaning table cafe got people work city girlfriend thing ok dropping really low mood week ago thought maybe depression took test internet basic question tried answer truthfully possible understand depression not want have known silly teenager think having depression make interesting people exaggerate emotion try look sad appealing answering question knew making depressed answered truth thing like lowered libido wanting sex girlfriend far far frequently used honest lot time having sex feel just going motion sleeping little odd increasingly erratic thinking death lot honest thought thought death dying natural fin easily bored people situation used enjoy writing story anymore worst thing mood swing low mood quite frequently feel like not want talk stop thinking bad thing happened happen personal level making centre blame them depressed just leaning towards natural growing finding world work adulthood trying adjust it depressed stop way thought going doctor sitting saying i think depressed doe not make sense me thought problem nature told ill not decide are sorry long poorly punctuated wrote fairly stream consciously help appreciated feeling pretty vulnerable right not want feel way anymore,0.5270795822143555,0.45521873235702515,0.4682827591896057
"Hi everyone. My name is Charlie and I have suffered from occasional bouts of depression for a while. Something that has recently taken my interest is the inferiority complex and how this affected my perceptions of things. I first got onto the idea through a page called Depression Hurts at a Hypnosis site 121 hypnosis (its worth plugging as I have found it useful). It took a while to admit to myself that I was afraid of not belonging, being criticized, sarcastic remarks at work etc and it stems back to horrid teachers and kids at school. This has been a turning point for me though - working through the false learnings and memories, so I thought I'd share it in case it resonates with anyone else. I've since recognized symptoms of inferiority in others (and they vary widely from conceited arrogance to total withdrawal), and it's been really great.",hi everyone charlie suffered occasional bout depression while recently taken inferiority complex affected perception thing got idea page called depression hurt hypnosis site hypnosis it worth plugging useful took admit afraid not belonging criticized sarcastic remark work stem horrid teacher kid school turning point working false learning memory thought share case resonates else recognized symptom inferiority and vary widely conceited arrogance total withdrawal really great,0.41695690155029297,0.4415035545825958,0.4332524538040161

"I'm a 23 yr old university student and I think I'm getting depressed again. One of the debates I'm having with myself is whether or not this is really depression. I was diagnosed with it about 2 years or so ago (although it wasn't my first bout of feeling low) and was put on a high dosage of medications (which I took). Things got better after a few months and so of course I stopped taking them cold turkey. Obviously not the best idea in the world, aside from this being one of the worst things to do because of the possibility of reoccurrence, my body went through heck and I had some pretty nasty side effects (even worse than when I was actually taking the meds). Fortunately, it didn't reoccur and I've been feeling fine until the past couple of months. I think I'm feeling the warning signs again: low energy, crying, circular thinking, apathy towards everything, skipping school, sleeping all day, anxiety ... I just feel like maybe this isn't really depression, maybe I'm just a person who doesn't handle stress well. Jeeze, when I read this it sounds so ridiculous. Part of me knows I'm being illogical but another part is just blaming me for being weak and not being able to just sit back and enjoy life. Why can't I just be happy? Why do I have to be so moody? Why am I so weak? It's stupid but I keep blaming myself. I don't think I'm bipolar since I've never experienced real highs but every couple of years or so my lows get really low. Last time was by far the worst and I wouldn't have been able to get through it without medications and I don't want it to get to that point again but ... I guess I still feel a lot of shame about it. It still feels like depression is being weak. I know, I know it's just like having diabetes and your body needs the chemicals to be normal but *sigh* I still blame myself. Last time I told my teachers and some friends and it's like they look at me as if I'm contagious or insane. I don't know if I can go through that again.

"Difference between antidepressent starting side-effects and hypomania? Hey all,  So I've read about how SSRIs can send bipolar people who are misdiagnosed with unipolar depression / anxiety into hypomania or mania. I've also read that SSRIs can have activating effects during the start up period (including insomnia, restlessness, distractibility) that sound similar to some of the symptoms of hypomania.   So if someone starting and SSRI experiences trouble sleeping, restlessness, increased energy, increased distractibility, periods of euphoria, spends money like it's nothing, increased pressure to talk/sing/dance, increased responses to music and caffeine, starting up old hobbies, etc.,  how can they know whether it's a combination of start-up side effects of the SSRI + feeling (much) better from the SSRI (or maybe placebo / excitement from doing something about the depression) or an antidepressant-induced hypomanic episode?  I know it's a question for a professional but I like to hear experiences also.

"I'm new here. But, I would like to know how to tell if I'm in depression. I have no idea where to post this at, but since I'm new here I guess this is the best place. Plus I can't start a new topic so... Well, anyway, here's how it is: Some days I can go without thinking about her, but at night, when I rest my head on my pillow, she eventually runs across my mind. When I say she, I mean my ex. More like.... I'm her ex. But eh... this took place a while back. Maybe like.... a year and a half. I met her 3 years ago in High-school. She was my very first true girlfriend and I didn't want anything to mess that up, but somehow I did that myself... or something along those lines. After a while of missing someone it doesn't really matter who was the blame for what. Sometimes when I make music I sing lyrics about her and how I want another chance and whatever. I'm not really obsessed with her or anything, but I sometimes want to just forget about her all at once, or wish I could go back 3 years. I guess that might be linked to regrets? Anyway, this whole thing is sort of an ON-OFF type thing, where sometimes I can't help but think about how it was, and sometimes, she's that last thing on my mind. Sort of like I put her on the back of my mind not to think about her, and save my hurt of later?? ... If that sounds right... Maybe I need a shrink. Who knows.... maybe i just need another girl.... But I'm pretty sure no other girl is going to want to listen to me talk about my past relationships.

"I'm new to this forum and actually to the whole talking to people I don't know online thing.  I've been looking around a lot online to find somewhere I can talk, but all the chat rooms and forums say they're about one thing and then you get inside and everything's about sex.  Then I stumbled into this place.  I started reading postings and everyone seems so concerned about everyone even though they have never met these people.  I haven't struggled with depression my whole life or anything like that.  I am only 22 but feel so old.  I am very, very recently separated (let's face it broken up) with my ex-fiance.  We have dated for almost five years and have a son together who will be two on Saturday.  He hasn't treated me the best (never hit or anything physical like that just never around) and he's really not what I want my husband or even the father of my children to act like.  He does have moments of goodness and this is what makes it so hard because why can't he always act like that.  I know he's capable of it.  I told him we should separate but I know he's been thinking it for a long time.  He's been forcing things because of his family and because he feels ""respect"" and blah blah for me.  I stayed around because he's the father of my child and face it it's hard to find someone new when you're a woman and you already have a kid.  I love him very much and I guess I was just expecting him to wake up one day and say man I need to change or I'm going to lose this great girl.  I wanted to separate because I think that's the only way he's going to realize how good of a girl I am and how good I am for him.  Now I'm scared though that he'll never come to this realization or meet someone else.  He says he's not looking, but let's face it he's a man.  He says he needs at least 6 months to find himself.  It makes it hard on me because we have a son together and for this reason my ex is always coming around and actually now that we're not together we probably see him more.   I have no family where I live and the last 5 years have been devoted to my ex and son.  I have managed to lose contact with any friends I had and never made any new ones.  I am now completely alone except for my son, which I feel like I can't take good care of because I'm always crying.  I'm a high school teacher and I had to take a couple days off this week because I'm so touchy and can cry if the wrong thought pops up in my head.

"I'm 46 and have been depressed since I was maybe 5 years old. I was emotionally abused by two confused parents. Depression & alcoholism runs rampantly in my family - fortunately I escaped the alcoholism. I was diagnosed as having major depression when I was about 25 and I've been on medication since then. I've also had intensive psychotherapy and done lots of research on the subject. Nothing erases the stigma!! ""Depression"" is misnamed. It should be called serotonin-deficiency disorder or something long and fancy so people will respect it. Too many say, ""Depression? Snap out of it!"" Or ""Do something to cheer yourself up."" What bunk. It affects every part of your body. Last year I realized that some of my depression was caused by kidney failure. I escaped dialysis and will probably be OK. But what a relief to have something ""serious"" to blame my problems on! Everybody respects kidney failure as a ""real disease"". I had to disown my brother last year because his reaction to my failing health was to call me a loser and an embarrassment. Very typical reaction from him, although the rest of my family were supportive. I now have no brother. I should have done it a long time ago. It takes such a long time to come to a point where you believe you deserve something good in life. I'm intelligent, employed and don't do drugs or alcohol, never have, but sometimes I feel like a bum, a worthless waste of space, not worth the effort. I have to argue myself out of that mindset every day, and it's so exhausting, and people wonder why I'm tired all the time and have no energy. I'm very angry, too. I have never had a successful relationship and don't believe I ever can. I don't even believe it exists. No kids, either, but maybe that's a good thing. They take a lot of emotional energy.

"I’m working on a new app/startup to help you guys. Please read this, I would really appreciate any help/feedback. Hello everyone! I’m a current sophomore in college studying Computer Science and this summer I decided to work on a new app that caters to depressed/suicidal people who are going through bad times. I want this app to connect depressed users to people who are volunteers at crisis centers or just regular people in general that are willing to devote their time to helping the users. This app will be similar to twitch where the volunteer will go live (and you can see their face) and any user can instantly connect with them. First, the user will enter their information like: what their favorite tv shows/movies/music artists are, where they’re from, and what type of gender they’d feel most comfortable talking to. All this information gathered will be used to connect the user with a volunteer that closely fits those preferences (the user can swipe through all of the options that are given to them and they can actually add these volunteers to a list that they’d like to come back to). I want it to be a one on one session where the user can decide to turn his/her camera on, or if not, just use the microphone, or if they don’t want to do either of those options, they can just use the chat box provided. I want it to be a social platform where users can connect with other users and see what they’re doing. Basically a user is becoming friends with their “streamers”/“volunteers” and other users as well. Also, these one-on-one sessions can be changed to a room where there can be 4 users to one volunteer and that way more people can connect with each other with like a “chaperone”. I wouldn’t dare dream of making any money from this app and I know I need funding from VC’s to get this thing skyrocketing. That is why I am getting all the resources I need from my school’s entrepreneurial program and they are going to connect me to the people I need to know. I hate to say it but if I need to make shareholders money, then I’ll do it, but I don’t want to make a single dime off of an idea that caters to people who are struggling through something so drastic. This may sound far fetched but my biggest dream for this app/company, is to have a box filled with goodies being mailed to users when the holidays/Valentine’s Day/ birthdays come around that include: letters/voice messages from volunteers saying “Happy Birthday!” Or “Merry Christmas!” Or “Happy Valentine’s Day!” followed by more messages that has to do with the user. This box will also include a lot more goodies that has to specifically do with the user.   I used to be like you guys. I can’t say that I suffered as much as you guys but I came to this sub a couple of times when I had no one else to go to. I had no shoulder to cry on in my freshman year of college which is why I think this app could actually mean something to someone. Please, we need to try and put an end to the huge suicide rate among children/adults in America. Please provide any feedback, whether good, bad, or helpful. Anything helps, really.

"Aha! moment during therapy So I've been meeting with a therapist about once a week since October of 2017. It's been really great, and has helped pull me from the brink more than once.   Background: I'm gay, and was raised Catholic in the 90s. Guess what happened next!   Spoiler: I was bullied mercilessly. If I wasn't too gay, I was too fat, or too tall, or too weird or too unpopular. You get the gist. It it wasn't my hair, it was my mannerisms; if it wasn't my high voice, it was the dark circles under my eyes. (Gee, what could have caused me to be losing sleep?)  Flash forward to today:  My therapist guided me through a meditation today that instructed me to visualize and speak to a younger version of myself. I described what I looked like, what characteristics defined me, and how I saw myself. Then I was instructed to, as myself as the adult I've become, speak to that child and tell him what I was feeling.   I spoke with kindness and compassion and love and respect for that child, and told him everything would be alright. I told him that all of that hatred was wrong, that it was incorrect and that those people who say all those nasty hurtful things, they probably aren't even going to remember saying it, so don't waste your time holding onto it.   And it got me thinking about all of the baggage I've he'd onto my life. All the glances and side comments and nasty, hateful things. And how I've internalized it, and believed it.   And that's when the Aha! moment came.   *All this time, I've been so worried about all the bullying that other people did, I wasn't even thinking about all the bullying I did to myself.* https://media.giphy.com/media/12KiGLydHEdak8/giphy.gif  All this time, *it was me.* Sure, it was other people who planted those seeds, but it was me who perpetuated it, who told myself that they were true. After all, if you say something enough, it might as well be as true as anything else.   So there it is. There's one step. It might just be one step, but it's a step in the right direction. There's my holy shit moment of the day, and I just wanted to share with you all. There is hope. There is progress. There is love. And I hope you all are able to find it.

"Im wasting my life As a 15 year old currently, I feel like i'm entirely disconnected from every human soul on this planet. I cannot properly have social interactions with others without me overthinking stuff that person says. What I mean is, if a ""friend"" tells me i'm dumb jokingly, I take it at heart. I take everything too literal, I cannot properly talk to others without me being awkward and silent. I cannot talk to people if I have ignore them constantly, if someone addresses me so they can talk to me, I sometimes ignore them and pretend like I never heard them. If a person says hi to me, I stay silent. I'll never get a girlfriend, i'll never feel a girls hand, or the feeling of affection, comfort, and attention. I never even got to talk to a girl before. Seeing everyone at school socializing with their girlfriend, hugging them, doing everything for them, absolutely destroys me as a person. I can see why I got bullied. Those times I was called ""Pussy"" ""Weak"" ""Retarded"" turned out to be true. The physical bullying I received, when they pulled my hair and embarrassed me in front of everyone in class by flipping me off my chair. I understand now, the stuff I deserve. I can see why my dad abondoned me ever since I was born, he was never there for me, I don't know what type of man he is or how he looks like. The brothers and sisters I never met, which I dearly wish I could. They're all so young, I wish I could have been a big brother for them. I hate living in isolation and loneliness. As if I wasn't lonely enough at school, but now at home. Everyone takes their brothers and sisters for granted, but a person like me would love one of those. My grandparents and mom say they love me, which I do believe, but I still feel no more or less that same, it doesn't matter in the end. I cannot do simple activities at school that involve groups, no because a person could possibly screw it up for us, but because I need to socialize. I cannot do sports because it involves me being around people and I absolutely despise it. What am I so afraid of? Being judged? Why am I here? What am I? It doesn't matter, I still die in the end anyways. Maybe taking my own life is the answer, it resolves all the pain I have received. Who cares what my so called family feels? They must know its for my own personal benefit, they should realize that when I do eventually end myself, that I will no longer feel the pain I once received. I never have felt an emotional connection between any of my family, they're doing their own thing in their life. Nobody at school would care, I only have two friends. Ones I hold dear because they understand my pain. Looks are deceiving aren't they? A lot of people in my school consider me attractive and cute, but good does that do me? I won't get any benefit from it either way.  A bit of a description of how I look like, long hair, feminine face, a thin appearance (not super thin, I weigh about 130). But anyways, I simply plan on ending my own life sooner or later, I don't know how long I can last. We have no value, no significant purpose of existing, so might as well end it now. I constantly wear this mask where i pretend i'm happy, when i'm not.  The only thing I do with my life is listen to Joy of Mans Desiring in bed, contemplating my existence.",im wasting life year old currently feel like entirely disconnected human soul planet properly social interaction overthinking stuff person say mean is friend tell dumb jokingly heart literal properly talk awkward silent talk people ignore constantly address talk me ignore pretend like heard them person say hi me stay silent girlfriend feel girl hand feeling affection comfort attention got talk girl before seeing school socializing girlfriend hugging them doing them absolutely destroys person got bullied time called pussy weak retarded turned true physical bullying received pulled hair embarrassed class flipping chair understand now stuff deserve dad abondoned born me not know type man look like brother sister met dearly wish could young wish big brother them hate living isolation loneliness not lonely school home take brother sister granted person like love those grandparent mom say love me believe feel same doe not matter end simple activity school involve group person possibly screw u need socialize sport involves people absolutely despise it afraid of judged here i doe not matter die end anyways maybe taking life answer resolve pain received care called family feel know personal benefit realize eventually end myself longer feel pain received felt emotional connection family doing thing life school care friend one hold dear understand pain look deceiving not they lot people school consider attractive cute good doe me not benefit way bit description look like long hair feminine face appearance not super thin weigh anyways simply plan ending life sooner later not know long last value significant purpose existing end now constantly wear mask pretend happy not thing life listen joy man desiring bed contemplating existence,0.4635297358036041,0.4193249046802521,0.5849159359931946

"I have a gripe about pharmaceutical and insurance companies.  You can take up to 450 mg / day of Wellbutrin XL.  The manufacturer makes 150 mg and 300 mg pills, but not a 450 mg pill.  OK, so just take 3 of the 150's, right?  Well if the doctor prescribes it that way, at least one insurance company won't pay for it.  The doctor has to prescribe it as one 300 mg pill plus one 150 mg pill - thereby making the patient have to pay 2 co - payments for what should be one prescription.   Why doesn't the manufacturer make a 450 mg pill?  And how can the insurance companies get away with forcing doctors to prescribe in what is really a stupid manner?

" First I want to introduce myself, I live in Arkansas I am 39 and a mom to 4 (18, 15, 8 and 3) I have been on and off different antidepressants for almost 4 years. Started out with celexa after I had my last baby, went through some ppd and haven't been the same since. I was on celexa for 14 months then stopped for 7 months, then went back on it and totally had a bad reaction. Then came zoloft, that lasted about 3 months sent me in to some sort of mania, then there was wellbutrin, wanted to drive off the road in to the lake on that, then came effexor which I thought worked but apparently I also was going through rapid cycling, I kind of liked that. I spent 3 months on that and about a month on the wellbutrin. Then came paxil cr, was on that for 6 months but I just cant get past these mood swings and outbursts. So now I have been on Lexapro for almost 3 months, today the doctor decided to increase me to 20 mg and add lamictal for my mood swings. I am a little nervous about starting this new one. This rash I hear about sounds scary. I also take 1 mg of klonopin as needed(everyday) I just wonder if I will ever feel the same again, but then it has been so long that I don't know if I would even know what that feels like. Sorry to ramble on, but that's my story. I am to start the lamictal tonight. wish me luck!!

"Tomorrow the world will go on like always I've never been here... this wasn't a part of ""the plan"" but I said why not leave something somewhere since no one else will be receiving anything. I have lived 20 years by myself, no relationships, no close friends, and the memories of being taken advantage of in my youth haunt me day in and day out. I run away through drugs but my depression is beginning to break through my facade of confidence. No one knows who I am and even if presented with a companion I don't know if I could ever explain the scars. I hate who I am and how I act, I feel though it's not even me. Social anxiety makes me act in ways I can't even understand and the repetition of ""I'm okay"" is getting old. I've tried to make friends but no one seems to want to know me and it's left me feeling like a sociopath. Insanity overcomes me as I scream, clenching a blade that can no longer quiet my mind. I've tried so hard to not be ignorant or selfish but I can't handle this anymore. The need of hospitalizations and psychologists remind me of the freak I am. I strive for perfection but am the opposite of it. I have so much love that I want to express but have no place to put it. I was raised religious but have so many doubts, my problem maybe isn't ignorance but overthinking, I hope... Nobody seems to understand subjectivity/relativity.

"When I was twelve, one of my younger sisters got leukemia. Despite my failing memory I can still remember a lot of what happened back then. I can remember being picked up at the park where I was playing to rush to the hospital where my sister had been getting tested. You could say I was whisked away from my innocence, but you're pretentious and I'm not. I can remember how my mother broke the news to me. And how her voice cracked a little when I asked how bad she had it. I can remember sitting in the front room of my grandparent's place, where I was staying so my parents could be with my sister in hospital, speaking to my cousin and saying that I felt it was somehow my fault. What followed was roughly a year of total disruption. My sister became the focus, understandably, while the rest of us learned to cope with the cloud hanging over us. Where a small rise in temperature could send hearts racing. But that has mostly been forgotten. Not blocked away, just forgotten. It was another age and doesn't feel real anymore. In the past few months the hospital has been doing a study of ex-patients and their families. Tonight it was my turn to do the phone interview. I'd been avoiding it, mostly because I'm lazy and I only ever seem to do things that I feel will be enjoyable to me. Anyway, so they called through and I spoke. I don't think there were really any surprises, although it was bizarre when I became conscious to the fact that I occurred to her getting cancer as it or that.

"Now this stupid posting thing is screwed up - I can't do anything right      Got the old depressed suicide bug again.      It's funny because last night i read some articles I had written  regarding death and suicide, many about saving other depressed persons from killing themselves, recognizing the pain that the survivors go through, and not wanting it to happen to my family. And then the thought rears its ugly head, it would be so easy to let myself go, go into that peaceful night, waiting until my mom dies first (soon - natural causes) and then doing it. Because I am a failure, I can't do anything else but fail at my job. I used to write in a cave type place - a place where my writings would be secure and it's going away. That's how come I looked at my writings.      I had told my therapist that it seems sometimes I feel angry and selfish and that's one of the triggers that trigger the thoughts of suicide. I have run out of visits covered by insurance I could pay for more but there is no need for visits - I've almost stopped talking. I feel like going home, crawling up on my bed with the teddy bear my husband hates and crying. At the cave web site, the others don't like to hear about suicide so I've stopped writing there (it's another site for depression type people - no one goes there now). I keep talking about death and suicide to my husband and my kid - and I feel guilty but the words and my thoughts are obsessed with death. I can make the decisions about my mom and my kid, but this halfway limbo concerning my states sucks.       I guess this is just venting. My mom has at least another week to live ....

"Things seem to follow you everywhere, things such as thinking of suicide and almost doing it. I did these things a few years ago well in a term of service with the US Army and was put in a ward for a few weeks and then released without even a proper name for what ever I was suffering from, and was sent to Iraq a week after leaving the ward. That as I said was a few years ago and I really never wound up in a hospital again yet, after I returned home and since it seems everyone knew I had one little problem. A problem that seems to plague me even to this day for I am now in the reserves and was yet sent to go back to Iraq but I was sent home due to on going mental problems from a few years ago. What I really want to know is there something really wrong with me or is this just a huge joke. I have been to doctors more then once and just with really nothing to go on but a shaken head. so I just was hoping someone out there knows or been though this really, as for my feelings inside it is hard for me to express I do not like to talk much of what goes on up stairs do to at times I don't really understand why at times I either feel like hurting someone or just having that lump in my throat feeling like I am going to cry but I cannot.

"Hi everyone, I'm new, and feeling kind of lost and shy. To introduce myself a little, I'm a 28 year old female. Up until about a year ago, I'd never had any problem with depression or any other mental illness, though all of the other women in my family have depressive tendencies. Suddenly, I started to feel differently in my mind - a feeling which has gone on getting worse and worse. The last four months in particular have been a downward spiral. I moved house from a big city to a small village late last year, and I'm not dealing with the change well. I don't know anyone in my local area, and I don't drive so I'm stuck in this little isolated world (I work from home). I lack the energy and the confidence to go out and meet new people. I tend to organize/run everything in our household so basic routines have just fallen apart, and my long-term relationship is under strain. My partner doesn't understand how I feel, while I resent the fact that he's making no effort to recognize the problem and take some action to help. My family and friends are 300 miles away, and I don't feel able to talk to them. This last week, I found out my Mum is having tests run for breast cancer. I know it's early days but it's just the last little thing that has pushed me over the edge. I am walking around either in a state of complete, grey numbness or in a state of unutterable misery, unable to react to anything in a rational way. I haven't left the house for days, because I hate the village where I live and being there just sends me into a blind panic attack. I've had an initial assessment for counseling in a city near where I live, but it'll be weeks before I can get an appointment. I know that I need to go and see a GP and get some medication, but I don't have the energy even to pick up the phone and talk to the receptionist, let alone to walk on my own through the horrible village. And I'm just so exhausted all the time. The internet's my only point of contact with the outside world at the moment. If all this sounds familiar to anyone, please reply - it would be a lifeline for me. Thanks Wizzy.",hi everyone new feeling kind lost shy introduce little year old female year ago problem depression mental illness woman family depressive tendency suddenly started feel differently mind feeling gone getting worse worse month particular downward spiral moved house big city small village late year not dealing change well not know local area not drive stuck little isolated world i work home lack energy confidence meet new people tend organizerun household basic routine just fallen apart longterm relationship strain partner doe not understand feel resent fact making effort recognize problem action help family friend mile away not feel able talk them week mum having test run breast cancer know early day just little thing pushed edge walking state complete grey numbness state unutterable misery unable react rational way not left house day hate village live just sends blind panic attack initial assessment counseling city near live week appointment know need gp medication not energy pick phone talk receptionist let walk horrible village just exhausted time internet point contact outside world moment sound familiar anyone reply lifeline me thanks wizzy,0.35003897547721863,0.4494912326335907,0.31168487668037415

"Hi - I am ""dad"" a new member today (12/18/05) I like what I have seen so far and have a need to express myself and get some feedback from others. It is so hard to look at yourself..... especially when wearing the ""dark glasses"" of depression. I am a man in my late 40's - educated, with family- wife and two great, smart, loving kids, 15, and 13. I will try to summarize my story. About 5 yrs ago, I was laid off (tech field)...it was very hard to find another good position. We were so spoiled, I was making 70K - 100K in the past few years. We took it for granted. We built (4) new houses since 1989 - and did well. We enrolled our kids in a private Christian school (a high priority for us) THEN - My wife was in a auto accident and has spinal damage. She is ""mobile"", but has chronic pain. She is also suffering from depression. I managed to find another job, but it was a very dysfunctional place. I had to take a few leave-of absences - then I became ""pegged"" as a weak person. They eventually let me go for ""too many LOA's"" I'm paying $800 for COBRA - we can't do this forever....the pressure just adds to my anxiety. After seeing my psychiatrist, he took me through MANY medicines and even ECT's.... we tried for three years to find the most effective drug. Presently I take Zoloft, Cymbalta, Lamictal,Xanax & Valium for anxiety. I also have osteopenia (bone density loss), so I take, fosamax and Tylenol 4 (narcotic) for back/joint pain. Lastly, I use Soma for muscle strain. I don't know if the medicines are helping me or adding to the problem....? I admit I ""lean on"" some of the medicines as a coping mechanism. I have had so many situational events in the last few years, I suspect my depression is more environmentally caused...? I seem to ruminate on the ""bad events of the past"" too much. I am ""stuck"" - and just can't seem to get aggressive at my job hunt. We just sold our 6 bedroom house and are now living in a three bedroom apartment. I feel guilty that my family has to go through this. I know that I have skills and experience; but I don't have the self confidence - my ego is ""on the floor"". My sleep pattern is crazy and my appetite for food (and sex) is GONE. My wife is getting frustrated with me and doesn't always ""build me up""... Her depression has her down too.... With two depressed parents,it is very difficult to support each other. I feel ""stuck"" and don't know what to do....sometimes I just feel like giving up.... Any comments or thoughts would be appreciated!",hi dad new member today like seen far need express feedback others hard look yourself especially wearing dark glass depression man late educated family wife great smart loving kid try summarize story yr ago laid tech fieldit hard good position spoiled making k k past year took granted built new house did well enrolled kid private christian school a high priority u wife auto accident spinal damage mobile chronic pain suffering depression managed job dysfunctional place leaveof absence pegged weak person eventually let too loa is paying cobra foreverthe pressure just add anxiety seeing psychiatrist took medicine ect is tried year effective drug presently zoloft cymbalta lamictalxanax valium anxiety osteopenia bone density loss take fosamax tylenol narcotic backjoint pain lastly use soma muscle strain not know medicine helping adding problem admit lean on medicine coping mechanism situational event year suspect depression environmentally caused ruminate bad event past much stuck just aggressive job hunt just sold bedroom house living bedroom apartment feel guilty family this know skill experience not self confidence ego on floor sleep pattern crazy appetite food and sex gone wife getting frustrated doe not build up depression too depressed parentsit difficult support other feel stuck not know dosometimes just feel like giving up comment thought appreciated,0.38980743288993835,0.4483368992805481,0.30797460675239563

I have been failing 2 of my most important classes and I just have no reason to keep going to them. It’s finals week and I’ve been stressed about finals since school started. I don’t even know if I want to stay in school anymore because I don’t want to feel like this.  I’ve also been slacking off so much on homework.

"Hello everyone. I'm here because I'm starting to have doubts about my mental health... First off I'm a 21 year old male college student, and up until about 2 years ago I think I've been fine...but lately I'm not so sure. For one thing I can't seem to concentrate or focus on ANYTHING anymore and it's becoming very frustrating. I find myself daydreaming or pacing only minutes after I sat down to do something important and because of it I can't get anything done. I can't even focus on things that should be fun, or the things I used to be dedicated too. I've also become very philosophical. I always find myself spending a lot of time thinking about life and death, the nature of existence, etc...But it seems like its becoming an obsession. I always feel like I'm wasting time but I can't bring myself to do anything constructive. Sometimes I'm disgusted when I realize how much time I spend simply pacing back and forth. I also can't fall asleep at night anymore...I just lie awake thinking and I can't make it stop. I also have constant fears about becoming old and having regrets about how I lived and what I accomplished. I also have constant regrets about the past. It seems like there's nothing I can do in life to satisfy myself and it driving me crazy...especially because for all the ambition I have I have no motivation whatsoever anymore. Also it's hard to explain, but I get the feeling that I can't feel life, if that makes any sense? It's like time is moving so fast that I can't even realize it.  Anyway, I was never like this before and I have no reason to be like this now. I don't have relationship problems or family problems and I'm not religious. This all just came out of nowhere with no apparent cause. Basically it has come to the point where I know something is wrong with me but I don't know what. I've kept telling myself this is nothing but its getting more intense and now I feel like I'm spiraling into a void or something. I guess I'm simply here to seek some opinions on what my problem could be. Thanks a lot for taking the time. PS I may have posted this in the wrong place but its my first post so I'm not sure...",hello everyone starting doubt mental health year old male college student year ago think finebut lately not sure thing concentrate focus anymore frustrating daydreaming pacing minute sat important done focus thing fun thing used dedicated too philosophical spending lot time thinking life death nature existence etcbut like obsession feel like wasting time bring constructive disgusted realize time spend simply pacing forth fall asleep night anymorei just lie awake thinking make stop constant fear old having regret lived accomplished constant regret past like life satisfy driving crazyespecially ambition motivation whatsoever anymore hard explain feeling feel life make sense like time moving fast realize it anyway like reason like now not relationship problem family problem not religious just came apparent cause basically come point know wrong not know what kept telling getting intense feel like spiraling void something guess simply seek opinion problem be thanks lot taking time p posted wrong place post not sure,0.39977407455444336,0.3299711346626282,0.3915852904319763

"Severe Ibs and depression combo is a death sentence Hi   I posted a few times on this forum last year April sometine due to my depression and I'm posting again because well, it's back. So I'm just going to write a few things about myself and why I'm posting here.  Im a 20 year old guy from London, England and I've been depressed for about 2 years now. I was also diagnosed with IBS about 7 or so years ago.  I was at university for digital media and I finished. My first year but  when the second year started my IBS symptoms got worse and I was I physically unable to go. thankfully the university gave me a year off and said I can start my second year next year after I get better.   However it just seems to be getting worse not better. I can barely go outside without going through severe anxiety attacks which leads to horrible pains in my stomach for which I need to go home to go toilet for, when it was really bad I would feel very faint and start having panic attacks.  It reached the point where I was practically housebound. I spent like 3 months playing games, watching anime and TV shows and the pains started to get a bit better.  Then 2 days ago I went toilet and it happened again, severe pain, feeling very uneasy and then boom out of nowhere crippling depression, the waves just hit me.  I began feeling hopeless again, I felt unsatisfied with life. Not just my life, but life in general. Thanks to my love of Anime, Webnovels, Games and Movies I started to wish my life was like that. I know it's childish, but deep down it's just how I felt. I couldn't accept reality, it was too mundane for me and I wasn't satisfied just sitting there everyday just watching or reading things. But I couldn't do anything about it because everytime I try to do something my IBS kicks in and basically cripples me. And I know that even if I try and do something, it's not really what I want. I don't want my life to be normal. All I would really be doing is trying to avoid the pain that it will never happen.   I know this is long and it might be hard to emphasize with me if you don't really understand it. But I just felt like I really wanted to say something and see if maybe there were other people like me. I guess you could say I'm looking for friends who can understand me, I'm hoping that maybe it will make living a little easier if I have people to talk about the things I love with who also understand what it's like going through depression.   That's the conclusion I came up with anyway  Thanks for reading",severe ibs depression combo death sentence hi posted time forum year april sometine depression posting well back just going write thing posting here im year old guy london england depressed year now diagnosed ibs year ago university digital medium finished year second year started ibs symptom got worse physically unable go thankfully university gave year said start second year year better just getting worse not better barely outside going severe anxiety attack lead horrible pain stomach need home toilet for really bad feel faint start having panic attack reached point practically housebound spent like month playing game watching anime tv show pain started bit better day ago went toilet happened again severe pain feeling uneasy boom crippling depression wave just hit me began feeling hopeless again felt unsatisfied life not just life life general thanks love anime webnovels game movie started wish life like that know childish deep just felt not accept reality mundane not satisfied just sitting everyday just watching reading thing not everytime try ibs kick basically cripple me know try something not really want not want life normal really doing trying avoid pain happen know long hard emphasize not really understand it just felt like really wanted say maybe people like me guess say looking friend understand me hoping maybe make living little easier people talk thing love understand like going depression conclusion came thanks reading,0.5384615659713745,0.3644774556159973,0.6039822697639465

"I've been in a constant rush to try and get on my feet for the last three years, but I always end up doing nothing about it. I've forgotten what motivation is all about.  Hey there, I just turned 22. And this is my situation:  About three years ago, I used to feel excited about everything. Finishing school, starting my studies at a university, being self-sufficient, finally doing what I thought was my future career.  I'm not sure what happened, but I started losing my drive. Things didn't look as exciting, nor entertaining. Never having even kissed a girl, I felt alone and loveless. Still, I felt motivated enough to start working on my social skills, met a few people over the Internet, even got a girlfriend. (Thanks to the Internet I have a social life, as ironic as that sounds, even though it's not that good).  Fast forward to this year, I was able to date a couple more girls, had a good time but they all ended too soon. I've never been able to have sex with the girls I've been with because I lost my sex drive in the course of these last years. Also the extremely low self esteem and self hatred don't help. Today, I find myself unable to even have a conversation with someone, mostly girls. I can't come up with anything to talk about and I feel like all the things I learned about social skills have gone away suddenly. How do people have such natural conversations with one another? How did I manage to do it before? I feel like I want new friends, I want to have a good time, but can't figure out where to go, or what to do to achieve that. Regarding my studies, this year was a slow one. In the time I should have completed 50% of my career, I only completed around 20%. I started visiting a psychologist because I can't get myself to study for my exams (I'm not cooperating much with him), and all I do is worry about it though I never take up the responsibility.   I am fully aware of the fact that things don't come if you just sit and wait, but I can't bring myself to do anything other than complain. Meanwhile I feel like my mind wants to run, but doesn't know which way to go, and my body won't budge. I think 24/7 about how I'm getting older, and I'm wasting every second of my life. I'm completely lost and feel like everything I do is going nowhere. And I don't even know how to end this post, just wanted to put this somewhere and hopefully get some solutions or words of encouragement from people who've been through the same.

"Questionable at best So I've been having depression/anxiety problems since middle school, I have suicidal thoughts time to time, but I have no desire to act on them?

"Glad I can help! Firelizardee has helped me a lot over on the effexor room (that's where most of my posts are). I've never really posted my story, but for what it's worth, here it is: I live in northern New York State where I grew up on the family farm. My brother and I run a feed/hardware/farm supply store. I've got a terrific wife and two daughters ages 1 and 3. My depression hit in January during a bout with the flu; my youngest daughter was hospitalized with febrile seizures and that might be what put me over the edge. My nervous breakdown seemed to come out of the blue, but I'd had an extremely stressful six months between job, illness, and adoption.  I'm also a hard driving firstborn perfectionist, and several family members have had alcoholism or suspected depression. So I guess depression should not have been so big a surprise, but it was. I'm a happy person with a great life! But I feel like I've been right to the edge of the precipice and looked down at Hell. Now I'm doing everything I can to ensure I don't relapse.....but I actually think I'm a better person having been through this. I'm much more appreciative of a 'good day' and I'm much more attuned to the suffering of others. It's amazing how many people I know have similar problems. And I hate that it has to be this way, but suffering does bring me closer to God. I hardly dare say that depression and anxiety was 'worth it'....the memory of the anguish is still too vivid, and besides, it could come back tomorrow. But right now, today, I feel more contented with my crazy, precious, stupid, dear, wasted, amazing life than I have been in years. I'm very lucky to have stumbled onto the right medication the first time, and to have a supportive family that didn't tell me to 'snap out of it'.

"Hi everyone I'm pleased to have found this place, maybe I will find some people here who understand what it is like to be struggling with depression. I am currently locked in my own personal hell caused by years of problems that I would never wish on anyone. I have tried to cope on my own for about 15 years (I'm 28), everything has started to go well in my own life and now is the time that it has found a way out (or that's what my psychiatrist has told me). I was married on my birthday in 2005 (I keep calling it this year because I keep forgetting that were now in 2006) and my husband tries to understand but how can he really? I'm off work at the moment because it's too much for me to cope with. I've recently been forced into getting help and I'm waiting for counseling at the moment (there's a 10 week waiting list). I've also been on 10mg cipralex for the last 18 months. I think that's enough to be going on with for now, and its got to be the most somber intro I've ever written!

"Thoughest time of my life, and honestly i cant show it So i meet this girl for nearly 2 years ago.  I'd say we are probably more then best friends, we are soul friends.  For over a year we talked about me moving to their town, so i can get closer to her, her husband and her kids.  We have literally been talking for nearly  2 years straight.  I understand that she is getting abit tired of me now,  but i just moved 1 week ago  and she has bearly talked to me once.  She is so busy playing video games right now, the only one that really has helped me this past week is  her husband.  I feel i moved so far for nothing, and now its KILLING me.  and since i wont have internet for a while,  im getting bored out of my mind, and my depression is hitting me so hard..  I did confront her about this though, but she keeps saying she is depressed and the only way for her is to play games.  Even tho when i play games, she keeps going to private worlds with friends, and whenever i as for an invite, she ignores it, even tho it pops up a big icon on her face.  My life has been so hard lately, my mom lost her kids in court, other then that, my stepdad made an false accusation of me doing stuff to a child becasuse he is a fucking moron and wanted to ruin my life for fun. (And no, i didnt do anything to a kid just FYI). I won the case but it was ever lasting 3 years..  Other thatn that ive been bullied for 15 years, i've lived alone for since i was 16.   Aswell im a very VERY jelous guy, so im not gonna deny that, and here is one of the issues with this:  MY EX fucked my life up with cheating on me, and since then i have big trust issues, aswell i tend to get very jelous now when my best friend is getting new friends and seems to have more fun with them then me.  Tho, i know my best friend would never leave me since she wanted me up here anyway, but the jelousy that she is having such a good time with others are ripping my life apart.  The past 5 Months has been depression only, and Honestly if people has gone through as much as me these past 5 months with suicidal thought every day, they would of gone mental.  I have a very strong mind, so it takes alot to take me down mentally, but for some reason, im lost and i dont know what to do. Half of the time i just wanna sit and cry.  Before i was friend with her, i had a depression but it wasnt that bad. I didnt have friends then so i didnt have to go through what i have now,  For some reason i feel like im not designed to have friends, that my life should keep going on the PC without real ""friends""",thoughest time life honestly meet girl nearly year ago say probably best friend soul friend year talked moving town closer her husband kid literally talking nearly year straight understand getting abit tired now just moved week ago bearly talked once busy playing video game right now really helped past week husband feel moved far nothing killing me wont internet while im getting bored mind depression hitting hard did confront though keep saying depressed way play game tho play game keep going private world friend invite ignores it tho pop big icon face life hard lately mom lost kid court that stepdad false accusation doing stuff child becasuse fucking moron wanted ruin life fun and no didnt kid just fyi won case lasting year thatn ive bullied year lived aswell im jelous guy im not gonna deny that issue this ex fucked life cheating me big trust issue aswell tend jelous best friend getting new friend fun me tho know best friend leave wanted anyway jelousy having good time ripping life apart past month depression only honestly people gone past month suicidal thought day gone mental strong mind take alot mentally reason im lost dont know do half time just wanna sit cry friend her depression wasnt bad didnt friend didnt now reason feel like im not designed friend life going pc real friend,0.45539432764053345,0.33899539709091187,0.5542631149291992
"Am I crazy for wanting to get back with her? So let me give you guys a bit of a timeline first:   - April 2017 we met at work, became really good friends. She still had a boyfriend, but broke up with him about 2 weeks after we started hanging out.   - June 2017 I told her I liked her as more than a friend, she didn't feel this way towards me at the time.   - July 2017 she started dating a guy she already knew, we'll call him Jake.   - August 2017 she broke up with Jake. Jake made her feel terrible for it and cut her off completely, leaving her to say that she hated him and wanted no part of him.  - September/October 2017 she told me she's always been attracted to me, but wasn't ready for a relationship. I was in love with her at this time, after knowing her for a while and her being everything I want in someone. Suggested being FWB, which I took her up on. But whenever I tried to make a move on it, she didn't seem to want to do anything. We hung out just us 2 every day, would always be talking, but for some reason when the time came around to make a move she never seemed to want to do anything.   Mid October 2017 she said how we would be better off being friends since we didn't seem to be going anywhere and that it was hurting her self esteem, and that she started talking to Jake again. She is currently still dating Jake, but from what I hear from her are on the verge of another breakup.  And now I want her more than ever. I was absolutely heartbroken when she cut things off with me, and I'm still not over her. And she knows this. If she cuts things off with Jake, I don't know what to do. I want her back more than anything, but at the same time it's like she put me through such pain and I don't want to chance that happening again. She is everything that I could possibly want in a girl, and I can't imagine myself without her. And we're still friends, which probably isn't helping to be honest. But she's still my best friend.

"This is a great topic. It looks like people associate with what was shared. I was laughing a little because for awhile I was so hypersensitive to sound I would not even consider turning anything on that created noise, even the noise from lights was too much. I used to go to a counselor who had a radio on in her waiting room. I could not stand it and used to turn it off. Then someone would turn it back on, having no understanding of what it was like to be me at that moment. That's funny to me now. I still don't like noise but I'm lucky since I have pretty good control over my environment. For awhile I was working in cubicles and was not sure I was going to make it. The one comment I wanted to share was what I experienced when I did turn the TV back on, read the newspaper, listened to the radio. I went without it for two years. What I experienced was the way the news was presented. I was captivated not by the words or circumstances of stories, but the tone of voice, the selection of what sound bites to use, the background chosen for a shot. I'm still fascinated by all that and even dreamed the other night I had been hired to be that person who decides how to present something. In my dream I was having a moral dilemma. My integrity is important to me and, in my dream, I was talking to my boss and trying to explain the emotional angst I was in. She kept saying, give them what they want, who are you to decide what is best for them. I woke up before I decided to quit or stay. But those words stayed with me through a day, who am I to decide what's best for someone else? What I do now is selectively listen to the news. I like NPR and sometimes enjoy McNeil Lehrer. I find if someone is expressing a strong opinion I will get annoyed if the presentation does not also include an opposing viewpoint. My main issue is selective presentation. I feel disrespected if someone is asking me to just trust them. I want to know what are the observations leading to a conclusion. I want to know what level of uncertainty there is. I don't like anyone telling me how to think or feel. I'm perfectly capable of creating all the drama I could ever use, on my own. I'm not clear where to place blame for all the drama the industry of information puts out there. I know someone is to blame. If only I could find that person or group then my hatred would be perfect. I'm kidding about that last sentence. I'm just trying to get a rise out of someone reading my share--I'm being frisky. I support public broadcasting and free speech. If I was in charge meetings would last forever because everyone would get a chance to speak. Wouldn't it be great if there truly was free speech in America. Wouldn't it be great if the principle of dissent was truly an American ideal.

"My bottom line concern is that I'm suddenly afraid of men. When a man speaks to me in public I'm suspicious of his intentions, and when a man was openly flirting with me two days ago I left the store and then became afraid that he might follow me home and had to go sleep with my 4 year old in his room with the door locked that night.

"Where to start.... Well, I guess I'm here because I think I have depression. I did recently talk to a therapist about it a couple of weeks ago. I guess it did some good because I feel like I may have gotten to the root of my problems. She told me that I was depressed and that I have probably had a low grade depression for most of my life. I kind of thought that I was depressed, because when I would read an article about depression with 10 yes or no questions I would usually answer yes to nine of them. The original reason my wife and I went to a counselor in the first place was because my wife was mad about my occasional habit of looking at pornography on the internet. I understand this bothers her and I do not want to do anything that will upset her. I could never give her an acceptable reason why I did it. I really do not know why myself. I do not think that I have an addiction to sex. It does not dominate my thoughts or life by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I think that I am pretty ""tame"" compared to most males. Anyway, this causes a lot of strife in my marriage because my wife considers this cheating on her. Well, back to depression. We got to talking about this in counseling and the counselor asked me if I'd ever been molested before. Oh boy. Well, this has always been the big secret part of my life. When I was 6 or 7 years, a female cousin of mine, who was about 4 years older, played some ""touching"" games with me over the course of 2 summers. It was all just touching, but I knew it was wrong. She would tell me that I could never tell anyone because I would get in trouble. So I didn't, until that therapy session. No, I had never told my wife because I always felt embarrassed and like I was to blame because I did not do anything to stop my cousin. I pretty much told the therapist (and my wife of course), everything that had happened to me. I got REALLY upset and probably cried more than anytime in my adult life. I felt somewhat better after talking, but inside I still feel ashamed and responsible for it. The counselor said that because of those incidences, I have had a low grade depression all these years because of holding it all in. I have ALWAYS had a hard time expressing my feelings about anything to anyone. That's just me. I told the therapist that I could see the low grade depression in my day to day life, but there are times when I feel like there is a huge, massive black cloud on me. I can be doing just about anything when suddenly I have this overwhelming feeling of dread and emptiness. There are times that I feel like if I could wish for my own death at that instant, I would gladly do it. When I don't have those bad lows, I just feel numb. The therapist said I might want to try medication, but I already take two different things for chronic physical conditions, and I really do not want to take anymore drugs. I don't like doing anything that I used to do; reading, sports, movies, etc. I have a teenaged son who is just terrific. He is extremely intelligent and just a great kid. I do not want my ""condition"" affecting him anymore than it already has. My wife is sometimes supportive, but I think she is tired of my moods. I have not had the porn problems any longer and I feel like I have gotten past that. (The therapist attributed those times of porn weakness to depression and looking for a way out). I feel like since the counseling sessions that the low grade depression has gotten worse. I am glad that I talked about the things that happened and how I've felt, but I really do feel worse than before. Is there anything I can do besides more drugs?

"Why am I an idiot? I always feel the need to be loved by someone else. So I am constantly trying to talk to a girl and get a date. I actually went on a date recently. A couple weeks ago I hit it off with this girl from another school nearby and we had a lot in common. We vibed really well and seemed to have similar feelings for each other. We talked for a couple of weeks and then we went on a date. I think we both enjoyed ourselves but we didn’t talk as often afterwards. I blame myself for that because I feel like I should have been more social with her. We don’t talk anymore and I wish I still talked to her but it has been a weird amount of time since our date and I don’t know how to go about it.

"I just don't know how to deal with this shit anymore. I can remember being depressed and having anxiety as early as 15 years old (31 now). I'm sure I have been happy some time along the way but I can't remember. I think most of the ""good"" times were just when I had enough energy to pretend and delude myself and convince everybody around me that I was normal and healthy. Unfortunately, as time has gone on my times of stability have gotten shorter, and my major depressive episodes have only gotten much worse, and lasted longer.  I've dropped out of 4 different colleges and have quit every job I have ever had, most of them with literally no notice. I have seen doctors, I've been on different medications with no noticeable effects. I am see a doctor now, but am hoping to get in to see a psychiatrist or mental health specialist soon, but that could be a month or two away at this point.  I am just completely exhausted at this point and don't know how much longer I can take it. My parent just keep telling me I need to get a job, like that would make everything better. It definitely doesn't help that they try to get me to go to church with the every other week or ask me all the time if I have met any girls that I'm interested in. They can't understand that just taking a shower on any given day or leaving the apartment to buy groceries is a monumental task.  They ask if I am suicidal, as if that is the only way to tell how severe my depression is. I don't consider myself suicidal, but I no longer have a desire to continue living. Every day I wake up is another disappointment, another day of being incapable of doing anything and feeling sorry for myself. I'm pretty sure the main reason that I'm not suicidal is that I am convinced that I would fail or just wouldn't be able to go through with it and the embarrassment would be too much to handle.  As much as my family frustrates me, I understand that they are trying to help but they just don't know how. They have supported me financially on several occasions before now. Without their help I would almost certainly be homeless or dead by now.  All I want is to not feel this way anymore. Every time I leave my apartment I am tense and in fear of the people around me. I escape for social situations as soon as possible only to get home and feel completely worthless. I can accept that I will always live with this illness, that it is never going away. I just want to find a way to make it bearable",just not know deal shit anymore remember depressed having anxiety early year old now sure happy time way remember think good time just energy pretend delude convince everybody normal healthy unfortunately time gone time stability gotten shorter major depressive episode gotten worse lasted longer dropped different college quit job had literally notice seen doctor different medication noticeable effect doctor now hoping psychiatrist mental health specialist soon month away point just completely exhausted point not know longer it parent just telling need job like make better definitely doe not help try church week ask time met girl interested in understand just taking shower given day leaving apartment buy grocery monumental task ask suicidal way tell severe depression is not consider suicidal longer desire continue living day wake disappointment day incapable doing feeling sorry myself pretty sure main reason not suicidal convinced fail just not able embarrassment handle family frustrates me understand trying help just not know how supported financially occasion now help certainly homeless dead now want not feel way anymore time leave apartment tense fear people me escape social situation soon possible home feel completely worthless accept live illness going away just want way make bearable,0.4841814339160919,0.5223759412765503,0.48519107699394226
"I'm new to the forum and just wanted to say Hi to everyone My depression stems from my husband and his secretive actions and cheating. I love my husband we have been together for 16 years and have 2 children together. He went to Thailand with his dad last year to visit his brother who lives over there working as a teacher, but before he left he found this website forum owned by a bar owner there who uses bar girl prostitutes as waitresses. To make this long story short he went with one of these bar girls while he was there and it took my children to find out the truth because I was too stupid to find out myself lol One found pictures of her in his organizer and the other found text messages on his cell phone. I should have known something was up as he never leaves his cell phone on anymore when at home anymore since he came back. He sits on that forum when at work and also at home all the men on that forum talk about the bargirls and post pictures of them also. My daughter sent a text message to the woman and she said a lot of hurtful things to her, I was worried for a few days that my husband would find out she was contacted and blame me. We also found pills he has been taking that he got from India called tadalasil which is a form of viagra, as far as I know he never had a problem sexually so why is he taking these pills? who knows lol My cousin called me a couple of days ago and said he posted a message on that forum saying he wants to go back to thailand again and what excuse could he give me for wanting to go, she said he also said that he posted he doesn't want to cheat on me just fuck other women when I'm not around. She checks the forum for me as I don't want to see it but it hurts just as bad when someone tells you what he puts. He doesn't have any friends really here where we are because all he does is works so I don't know if the men on the forum are substitutes for real friends and he is putting what they would find interesting or what. I don't drive and we live out in a rural area with no real neighbors so I don't get into town barely and I don't have many real friends here as we moved here to do some job work. So that saying LIFE SUCKS really seems to fit lately lol My concern lately is sex transferred diseases such as AIDS as I found out that thailand is known as a sex trade country and many have the disease. Prostitution is illegal there but they allow businesses to operate like that bar due to the money the male tourists bring there. The government is going to give asia and africa millions of dollars to help research AIDS but they are not going to make Thailand help stop the spread of the disease by shutting down places that promote prostitution, they worry about bird flu or about people carrying weapons onto planes but they don't care if men bring a silent killer like AIDS back into our country and infect their spouses or lovers. Do I sound crazy? because sometimes I feel I am going crazy lol I'm sorry for rambling on but I have held this in for months, scared to talk to him as i love him with all my heart even if others say I'm an idiot and scared to talk family and friends anymore about it because it hurts to much.

"I’ve lost the last of my hope for “my turn”. I (24M) think that without making the conscious decision to, I’ve given up. I think I’ve just reached the point where I’ve stopped kidding myself that it’ll all “get better” or “work out someday” like people always tell you. What I can’t seem to shake is the faint screaming in the back of my head trying to get me to fix everything, the one who still believes happiness is possible despite my entire existence thus far indicating otherwise.  I work at a job in an office doing pointless work that I used to swear to myself in high school and college that I’d never wind up doing. 5 days a week I wake up at 7, leave at 7:30, work from 8-5, and get home (at my parents’ house) at 5:30. Then I eat dinner with them, watch TV with them, and they go to bed, so I turn in at 9, watch more TV, and go to bed myself. On the weekends I typically do nothing. When I do go out or hang out with a friend, we do nothing, just sit and watch TV or a movie. Unless we can find some fictional world we can discuss (Marvel, GoT, Star Wars, etc) we don’t even have much to talk about. I maybe have 2-3 friends that I do this with, and again, not too often.  I do not currently have, nor have I ever had, anything even resembling a love life. I was foolishly in love with a close friend who felt nothing for me thru high school and most of college before I managed to stop kidding myself on that one. I’ve never had sex with or even kissed a girl. The closest thing I ever did was cuddle with a really close friend, and I even fucked that up because I overthought everything as always and didn’t make a real move, and she instantly lost interest/gave up on me, and now we’re barely even friends anymore.  I’m an introvert with no desire to change. I have no interest in going out to bars, clubs, or anything people my age for some reason enjoy. All I want is a person to love and spend my time with and provide each other with the human contact we need. My idea of the perfect evening would be cuddling on the couch with a girl I love and watching Netflix, just enjoying the closeness, maybe some kissing. Sex is something I want but not even on my radar right now.   My life goals can be summed up in saying I want to find my “person” have a kid or two, and do what I can to make them and myself happy. I just honestly don’t see the path to that reality, though. Nothing matters to me anymore. Just my parents, and I can honestly say that I am 100% safe as long as they’re around because I care more about them than myself. However, if they were gone tomorrow, I think I’d be close behind.   I just don’t see a path out of this pointless existence that I feel capable of taking. I feel like I’m just serving a sentence, going through the motions until it’s mercifully done.  No question really. I just felt the need to say it and acknowledge that I’m done. With everything.  TL;DR: I’m done, burnt out. Life’s never been good to me and I’ve stopped expecting “my turn”. I see no way to achieve the few things in life I want.",lost hope turn m think making conscious decision to given up think just reached point stopped kidding better work someday like people tell you shake faint screaming head trying fix everything belief happiness possible despite entire existence far indicating otherwise work job office doing pointless work used swear high school college wind doing day week wake leave work home at parent house eat dinner them watch tv them bed turn watch tv bed myself weekend typically nothing hang friend nothing just sit watch tv movie unless fictional world discus marvel got star war etc not talk about maybe friend with again not often not currently have had resembling love life foolishly love close friend felt high school college managed stop kidding one sex kissed girl closest thing did cuddle really close friend fucked overthought did not make real move instantly lost interestgave me barely friend anymore introvert desire change going bar club people age reason enjoy want person love spend time provide human contact need idea perfect evening cuddling couch girl love watching netflix just enjoying closeness maybe kissing sex want not radar right now life goal summed saying want person kid two make happy just honestly not path reality though matter anymore just parent honestly say safe long care myself however gone tomorrow think close behind just not path pointless existence feel capable taking feel like just serving sentence going motion mercifully done question really just felt need say acknowledge done everything tlr done burnt out life good stopped expecting turn way achieve thing life want,0.46363770961761475,0.34572353959083557,0.4362892508506775

"There truly is no hope. For any of us. This is the bleakest truth of all. Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born.   But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but it doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved.   And the truth is I feel so angry, and the truth is I feel so fucking sad, and the truth is I've felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long I've been pretending I'm OK, just to get along, just for, I don't know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own.

"Hi all, I've just registered here... I've been depressed for quite a while, my dad died when I was 7 and my best friend died when we were 18. After the death of my father I was in counseling, but my counselor stopped coming to school to see me and I don't think I ever got anywhere from it. I'm currently 23, almost 24 (and male, from the UK for those keeping count) I've felt crap for ages... I hate my job, and doing that along with the stress of my final year of university sent me on a downward spiral. I would worry so much about my workload, but have no motivation to do it and get out of the situation. I hate being single, but can't find someone special who likes me, who I like back. I want to leave my job, but I can't afford to until I leave university and get a job doing something I want to. I had thought about suicide, but I know the pain of losing people close to me, and I couldn't inflict that pain on someone else. I considered cutting myself too. I thought that maybe if I was hurt, I could get extra time for university work, and maybe someone would help me. But I realized that I shouldn't do that, and should see someone about it. I also didn't have the balls to do it. I think bad thoughts a lot but I don't think I could go through with them. I was worried about going to the doctor though. My previous experience with a counselor has put me off them, and I don't like talking to strangers about my problems - that said I don't like telling people I know either because I feel that they will judge me. I was also concerned about medication because I don't know if I like the idea of chemicals altering my brain (apart from alcohol that is!) But about 3 weeks ago I finally went to see my doctor. He has put me on 20mg of Fluoxetine a day, although I'm not sure whether it is doing much. I've been having headaches and going a bit dizzy as well as getting sleepy (among other side effects). It's weird though, I don't know whether I'm feeling better or not, my friends say I seem different and better for taking it but I still feel bad at times... I still lie in bed at night worrying. But I think maybe I need to take it more and see how it effects me long term. I guess even on medication we all have good days and bad days. I was scared to tell my mother that I was on anti-depressants, as she works in mental health. Some would see this as a blessing as she understands the field to a great degree, but I was worried because I thought that she might think I was mad. I eventually got the courage to tell her after about 5 days though because I was very dizzy and I thought that she would suspect me of being on illegal drugs. She is being very supportive now, while still keeping enough distance that I don't feel like she's worrying too much about me. It's good to know that she understands that it's going to help me cope though... and she says its only a minor drug compared to what some of her patients take to stop the voices telling them to do things. Anyway I decided to look for somewhere online where other people know what it feels like, and I am glad that I've found this place. I hope I can make some new friends here, and maybe I can help a couple of people too.",hi all just registered here depressed quite while dad died best friend died death father counseling counselor stopped coming school not think got it currently and male uk keeping count felt crap age hate job doing stress final year university sent downward spiral worry workload motivation situation hate single special like me like back want leave job afford leave university job doing want to thought suicide know pain losing people close me not inflict pain else considered cutting too thought maybe hurt extra time university work maybe help me realized not that it did not ball it think bad thought lot not think them worried going doctor though previous experience counselor them not like talking stranger problem said not like telling people know feel judge me concerned medication not know like idea chemical altering brain apart alcohol is week ago finally went doctor mg fluoxetine day not sure doing much having headache going bit dizzy getting sleepy among effect weird though not know feeling better not friend say different better taking feel bad time lie bed night worrying think maybe need effect long term guess medication good day bad day scared tell mother antidepressant work mental health blessing understands field great degree worried thought think mad eventually got courage tell day dizzy thought suspect illegal drug supportive now keeping distance not feel like worrying me good know understands going help cope though say minor drug compared patient stop voice telling thing decided look online people know feel like glad place hope make new friend here maybe help couple people too,0.40153104066848755,0.4063768684864044,0.4332026541233063

"The last few weeks I have slid back almost as far as before I started treatment. Just when I thought I was improving.  I finally went to the drop in center called Sunshine Place, as someone was giving a talk on depression. The counselor spoke with me for about half an hour after her talk and said she thought I needed more help than my GP was giving. For the first time in a few months I actually broke down and cried again - which is very annoying to me. She wrote down the number of the Mental Health Center with some suggestions for them. I rang the next day for an appointment (and that was hard just to ring). She had told me I might have to wait a few weeks for them to see me, but they made an appointment for the next day.  The psychiatirst there was okay (I didn't even cry like I normally do when talking to a new doc) but I told her I was tired of telling the same things to every new person. The short of it is they are changing me from Lexapro to Avanza and organizing for some CBT. I see my regular GP next Tuesday so I am pleased they said they would inform her of the medication change. I was also warned that I would probably feel a bit more depressed while the medication change was taking place; so I duly warned Mom and Matt not to take any notice of any strange behavior. Matt as usual just laughed and said ""yeah, Mom's going to go psycho"".  Now I just wait for them to contact me about the CBT.  If I don't answer any posts you'll know why, but I will try to just put a little emoticon up every now and then to let you know I am thinking of you all, and that I am still listening.

I feel like he’s more in touch with how he feels and is working on coping mechanisms better. However he did not go to his session today and that caused problems. He got his check from work today and it would not get deposited, and that set him off into a fit. He started breaking things and getting in both mine and my parents faces, cussing and attacking us. We had a conversation after and he said he tells himself the thing we tell him, such as how he needs to be more rational and more committed to getting better. He also eats unhealthy and is overweight, and I’ve attempted to help him get healthier about a month ago, but he stopped listening to me about. I love and care for him deeply but our family is at our wits end with what to do. I would want to leave him be and let him sort his issues out without us harassing him about it but when he gets violent and angry around the house we can’t sit idly.

"In college (10 years ago) I was the victim of a gang rape. I've read up quite a bit and identified with all the stages and normal reactions... I went through the self blame, and guilt, and anger, and depression, and I came to realize it wasn't my fault. I never reported it and after a year I decided the best thing would be to forget about it. I pretended it didn't happen and went on with my life. I forced it out of my thoughts until it was no longer a struggle to do so. Eventually I almost did forget about it. I never thought about it and when the subject was referenced in other contexts I never even thought about my particular experience. It almost became some movie I saw, or some girl I knew about. I'm married now with a four year old child and I have a really great life. About six months ago I started having these rape fantasies. I've been too embarrassed to ask my husband to act them out, but he does oblige in rough sex, and I started asking for it more often. I've felt confused as to why I would want this with my husband (and it is always with him ... I don't desire this with anyone else) when I have this history. It started me thinking about them even again. Then I started having nightmares about three weeks ago. Horrible realistic dreams where I actually wake up and I'm still hallucinating that men are holding me down. Last night I punched my husband full in the chest because I thought he was attacking me when he was just trying to wake me from a nightmare. This along with the COMPLETE lack of sexual desire where before we had a very healthy sex life. I'm a big fan of the ""STOP THAT"" approach to self help, but I can't seem to stop this. I'm beginning to dwell on it now. Also I try not to ever deny husband and with the high job related stress he's having right now he's seeking sexual gratification every night.

"Anyone else feel they are unloveable? TLDR: I feel I have no friends and anybody I get close to leaves   I started noticing I was always unhappy and sad in my last year of high school. I didn’t understand the point of life anymore and everyday driving to school I just thought how easy it was to drive off a cliff on the way to school. I got scared and told my parents who helped me get professional help. I confided in my 3 best friends at the time and almost immediately I noticed 2 of them stopped talking to me. The third I’m still friends with but not nearly as close as I used to be.   When I went to college, my roommate and I became best friends but a year later, he decided to drop out and leave.

We decided we could last through the distance so I took the job and moved 3000 miles away. She just told me it wasn’t working out and broke up with me.   She was my best friend and my girlfriend for 2 years. I never felt a connection with anyone else as strong as I did for her. Now I’m fearing my depression may have come back. I’m thinking I didn’t defeat depression but instead had her to use as a support. I’m here on the east coast of the US and I have no friends or family around me. I don’t know what to do and everyday I just feel like it’s me vs the whole world. I’ve already lost all hope and I feel like I don’t deserve happiness. Why else would happiness be ripped from me every time I feel like I found it.

Just feeling very isolated right now. It's one of those situations where all I want is for someone to realize I'm drowning. All I want is to be offered a hand up... To feel like I actually matter to someone. I recently lost what I would consider to be my last friend IRL and haven't been out of the house for any reason other than work in weeks.  The person I call a best friend is a person I've known less than six months who lives half way across the country. I've been waiting around hours hoping he will ask me for a phone call. He hasn't. And I don't want to continually pester him since he hasn't offered me a phone call tonight. I don't really know why I'm posting in this group. I guess so maybe I can imagine that someone somewhere will read my current thoughts and maybe I won't feel quite so alone. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. ,just feeling isolated right now situation want realize drowning want offered hand up feel like actually matter someone recently lost consider friend irl not house reason work week person best friend person known month life half way country waiting hour hoping ask phone call not not want continually pester not offered phone tonight not really know posting group guess maybe imagine read current thought maybe not feel quite alone thanks reading far,0.524724543094635,0.3774714469909668,0.519455075263977
"i'm circling the drain i'm sorry if this is in the wrong place.  i feel like i'm at my limit  i'm trying to wait for health insurance to kick in from my fast food job. i hate this job. i like my co-workers, even though they think i'm weird. i'm trying so hard to get them to like me. i just want people to like me. people always said i was weird and made fun of me. i mean, thats like anyone else, i guess.   i've always hated myself. always. i'm aware its probably internalized whatever from however many years of violent bullying and social isolation, but its to a point where my gf and roomate can see. i'm trying so hard to work this job and i'm smoking so much weed to cope and i get so anxious and have to talk to all these people and i'm always doing something weird and all i want to do is play Melee because its how i decompress (i do music as well but its shit), but i've developed thoracic outlet syndrome i guess from chest breathing for years and now my scalenes are fucked and everytime i play Melee i start chest breathing and i can't do the one thing i really want to do and i know thats pathetic, i can't quit my job because we need rent, i don't want to leave because i need health insurance so i can start going to therapy and possibly start physical therapy because my posture (forward head) is fucked. i don't talk to any of my friends. for some reason once they're not physically there i can't be a good friend. i lost my original best friend that way, socially defective. all i have is my gf and puppy and roommate and i flucuate between 'splitting' on them (because i possibly have bpd) and desperately wanting to avoid having them seeing everything wrong with me, they're all i have.  i don't mean to be an attention whore  i've always been this ugly, boring fucking unwanted piece of worm shit. my dad cheated on his wife with my mom. i knew he had left when i was young but i didn't know i was a mistake until my uncle told me, in so many words, the 'truth' about my birth, and how i'm lucky to be alive, and how she prolly should've aborted me (i was a spoiled, shit kid and he was trying to get my attention. honestly this story isn't even a big deal, though i did break down retelling it once. i'm filing it under just being high at the time). i kind of ruined my mother's life. kids never liked me either. in general, people only like me when i'm in full 'social camouflage'. i'm nice, witty, assertive, all the traits of normal folk. as soon as that camo starts to thin, and i start doing all my stupid retarded fucking worthless mannerisms, or sounds, or daydreaming, or opening my mouth to talk naturally about anything i want to at all, i'm outed. i've had my entire classroom laugh at me, more than once. my own friends, even by original bets friend, would make fun of me and call me ugly. i mean, again, nothing new, but just to paint a picture of whatever i guess i'm sorry  i wish i was prettier. i'm a guy but sometimes i wish i was a girl. i don't think its gender dysphoria, i just abhor my physical appearance. i can count on the fingers of one hand how many times ive looked into any kind of reflective surface.  i come from Christianity so i guess the idea of me possibly having depression is so surreal to me. i've thought of suicide nearly every day since this year's started. some days every hour. every minute. constantly. sometimes i daydream about it. sometimes the thoughts make me sad. sometimes i'm so mad at myself i want to make the thoughts a reality, blood and all. sometimes the thoughts get so bad, so gory and so tragic. i'm sorry i guess there's something wrong with me, i feel scared because i feel like i'm being pushed over the edge and i can't do anything about it. i talk to myself, in actual back and forth convos, completely with laughing and inside jokes and even some 'us' 'we' and the like pronouns thrown in (sounds like so many other internet posts lmao). it started as a imaginary friend, and just kinda went from there as I trimmed the fat. it helped. i've been so abysmally lonely most of my life. i have a gf and puppy now. she knows i'm depressed, but i can't tell her how much. i can't tell her that i scope out the highway water bridges for places i can park. or at least walk to. i'm trying so hard. on one hand i know what killing myself would do to her. but some times it gets so dark. sometimes it gets so bad i know she'll be overjoyed to see my corpse. sometimes i think about killing myself in front of her, or my co workers. i think about dying, every day, every minute, every second. i think about dying painfully. i'm smoking all the weed i can and i try not to think about it. i just tell myself i'm venting, mentally. i've never attempted. its just ideation.

"I'm a 24 year old woman living in Florida with my husband. I have been severely depressed for 6 months, and now looking back I can see that it actually started about a year and a half ago. If only I could go back and warn myself.  Like many of you, I have been suffering depression since I was very young. In fact, I can remember being in first grade, coming home and going to bed for the rest of the night. Of course, back then it felt more like fear. In 7th grade, I asked my mother if I was a manic depressive because I had read about it and I felt I had all the symptoms. She scoffed and said it was just normal teen hormones that made me feel that way.  I love my mother and she has always been there for me. I used to call her at 2 in the morning crying and she would talk to me until I felt better. However, when I call her up today, she still doesn't understand when I tell her I am depressed. She thinks I need to get up and start doing things until I snap out of it. I try to tell her I have bills screaming at me and I still can't get out of the house to find work. I think she is in denial. Now, with all of the information I find on this site, I think I may even be bipolar.  When I found the man I wanted to marry, I warned him that I had experienced many deep depressions in my lifetime and that it was probably likely to happen again someday. He said he would stay by my side no matter what, and he has. Unfortunately, it is painfully apparent that he has no idea at all how to handle it. When he tries to talk to me and cheer me up, I say mean things to him until we are both raising our voices. Let me tell you, when I'm like this, I don't back down either. I usually say something hurtful and then grind my teeth in anger for a while. He gets mad too, but it is also painfully apparent that he forgives me. Then, I feel like a real jerk.  I just started seeing a psychologist, since I haven't had a job since last August and it's clear that I don't know my way out of this. I have only met with her once, but I think I will like her. She has told me to do a few simple things everyday until our next meeting on Wednesday. She wants me to get 1/2 hour of sunlight everyday, 15 minutes of exercise, and try to make a simple daily schedule to follow. I'm a bit worried because I haven't been able to do them because I just don't sleep right anymore. It is 8am and I haven't slept yet. I may fall asleep in a few hours, only to toss and turn and then wake up in the evening feeling like crap. I have tried some medicines but they don't help. Have any of you had this problem? What did you do?

"No lodging for the sad Being depressed sucks. That's easy to grasp. Most people who aren't clinically depressed understand this. What they don't understand is that being depressed and honestly trying to get better is extremely difficult, and our ruggedly individualistic society doesn't give a single fuck about you. You need help? Fuck you.  Your wealth isn't just something you have, it's seen as a reflection of your worth as a person. Poor? Sad? Find it difficult to wake up? Find it difficult to complete things? Do you procrastinate because of underlying psychological issues? Fuck you, you're just lazy.  The clear message capitalism sends me is that if I can't work, or I can't work enough, or I can't work doing a ""high value job"", or if I need help to get better so that I can do those ""high value jobs"", I probably ought to just go die, because I'm clearly worth nothing.",lodging sad depressed suck easy grasp people not clinically depressed understand this not understand depressed honestly trying better extremely difficult ruggedly individualistic society doe not single fuck you need help fuck you wealth not just have seen reflection worth person poor sad difficult wake up difficult complete thing procrastinate underlying psychological issue fuck you just lazy clear message capitalism sends work work enough work doing high value job need help better high value job probably ought just die clearly worth nothing,0.45448940992355347,0.4416348934173584,0.6685437560081482

"I'm not sure where to start.  I've been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, disassociation, and bipolar.  I'm also a cutter, suicidal, I hear things and see things.  Needless to say I don't deal with stress very well.   Sorry this isn't a good introduction; but I really do need some help.  I'm a college student only because the VA (veterans Affairs) is paying for it through their vocational - rehabilitation program.  I'm unemployed.  For 3 months I've been fighting with social services just to get food stamps.  I finally got them.  Beforehand food was scarce.  I've had eviction notices and by miracles my roommate and I manage to get just enough money to not get evicted at the last minute.  I've missed class and 2 therapy and other doctor appointments because I haven't had the gas money to get there.  I apply for jobs every day, but I have absolutely no luck getting a job.  So with all this any normal person would become naturally depressed.  But me, I'm losing my mind.  I can be happy and laughing and goofing off with my boyfriend one minute; but the next I'm kicking and hitting and seriously hurting him.  Then we end up in some stupid argument where all I say is shut up or go away, or whatever.   I just don't want to hear it.   I know missing my therapy appointments hasn't helped.  I do have a psychiatrist appointment in 2 weeks and a therapy appointment in 3 weeks.  But I need some help now.   I've lost all my motivation to do anything.  I've been in bed today for 17 hours and I just feel so angry.  Angry and fearful.  The only thing is that I don't know what I'm angry and fearful about.   My mood shifts so quickly and swiftly that I've lost complete control of who or what I am.  The more I try to relax the Angrier and more fearful I get.

"Well, it's been a year now since I tried killing myself A year ago on December 1st I tried to kill myself. I spent a week in a psych ward and have been on lots of meds and doing lots of therapy since then. The therapy has helped quite a bit, I've slowly learned how to listen to myself and how to take things one day at a time. As far as meds go, my anxiety is much more controllable and my sleeping meds actually work (mostly) so I can't complain too much.  I don't think I'm ever going to overcome depression. I've kind of learned to live with it, sure, but beating it probably won't happen; I'm way too cynical to beat it. It's just how I'm wired. There's a lot in life I probably won't get to experience because of how I am. And I still don't know how to change that, or at least make some good out of it.  I guess what I'm trying to say with this post is, I'm not sure if I'm happy or not. It's the not knowing that bugs me. I know I'm better than I was a year ago, but I still feel lost, and I don't know where to go from here. Every day is just a haze that I trot through.  Sorry for the rambling.

"Dead is better than alive imo. I wouldn’t say I feel particularly sad or depressed, as a constant state. It’s all over the place. But I think I do want to die. I choose to believe there’s nothing after we die; no afterlife, no heaven or hell, no reincarnation, or godly ascension. Just a beautiful, peaceful nothing. And it just seems so much better than being alive.   When you’re alive, you feel so much. Yes, there’s happiness, excitement, surprise, love. But there’s also sadness, anger, hate, jealousy.

"Getting over a girl Hello everyone, I’ve been subscribed to this sub for a while now but always been a lurker and never posted anything. I feel that this is the best place to get advice and help for what I’m going through right now...  So I’m a 19 year old guy, I’ve never had a serious relationship with a girl before.   I met this girl a few weeks ago and I instantly liked her. She’s the most amazing girl I’ve ever met. She’s funny, smart and so beautiful. We started texting/snapchatting. I told her I liked her and she said she felt the same about me. We started “talking” and we met a few times and things were going really well. Last weekend she stopped over at my house and we watched some Netflix and had such a good night with each other. I knew I was in love with this girl and I could honestly see us getting in a relationship in the future. After she left my house the following morning she started acting weird. I asked her what was wrong and she said her ex boyfriend was going crazy because she stayed over at my house. She then said she just needed to be alone for a while and that we should stop seeing each other because she still hasn’t properly got over her ex. It was so horrible, I started crying for ages and I couldn’t stop. I still feel so upset about it and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get over her. How can I get over her? I can’t stop reading our texts messaging of us saying we love each other. This is so hard. I’m crying again.

"Realising your mental state and life is unfixable sucks Just started to realise this. Been working my way to suicide last year but it didn't work out.    So I'm trying my best (how ironic) to just feed myself everyday, and not letting my emotions burden the ones I love (or any person I come across). Basically just existing plainly.   I really wished I could show affection to those I love and care about. But I realise that without any qualities as a person, I'm better off just not being a nuisance and a liability.   Feeling lonely sucks. I wished I feel loved by those whom I love. But staying away (while not killing myself)  is my only way to protect them from myself.   Oh well. Thanks for listening.

"... being that I don't know anyone here yet, but I feel like I am about to boil out of my skin if I don't get some of this out.  Last week I left the house for the first time in nearly a month and saw my doctor about the state of my head. It was the hardest thing I have ever done (that didn't involve burying a loved one) as I was brought up to believe that one shouldn't talk about one's feelings with other people. Although the sawbones made all the right noises I don't know if he even believes me. I don't know if seeing him was the right thing to do because since walking out of his surgery all I have had is deeper anxiety, more guilt, and a feeling of total and utter desperation - I think it's actually a little worse than before. I feel like this is not going to get any better, ever. I'm scared ... I don't know how this is going to end up for me. I can't see a way out. I have been depressed for a very long time but since losing my job a little while ago I have hit the proverbial bottom. I have suffered from anxiety for many years but recently it has been getting worse - I had my first panic attack last year. It doesn't matter what I try to do to stop it, all I can think about is death, pain, more death, failure, and yet more death. I have been having horrible nightmares for months (and haven't slept properly since my teens). Long story short  (ish): when I was little the Infamous They told my parents I was 'gifted'. They had high hopes for me. I won a scholarship to a good private school, where the other little girls made fun of me. Then the scholarship ran out and I had to go to a state school. Where the other little children made fun of me, spat at me, physically attacked me and eventually my parents had to take me out of school altogether. They found a better one, where the other kids continued to make my life hell. When I was about 12 or 13  I started self harming (cutting my arms with broken light bulb glass). My mother noticed once, shouted at me, and then never raised the subject again. I continued to do it until I was about 17. My dad bullied me when I was a kid; basically he subjected me to about 15 years of mingled disinterest, public humiliation, and emotional abuse. Then he did a disappearing act three years ago - leaving my mother in financial trouble. I have not heard from him since. I have wasted my life. Nothing I have ever attempted has succeeded - really nothing, and I have never been able to please the people I was trying to please. I used to think I was a talented artist (wanted to be a comic - book artist) but now I have no self - belief left. I haven't picked up a pencil in weeks and I can't even bear to look at any of my work. I can't do anything anymore and there is nobody I can talk to - my mother is my only close family and she doesn't believe in mental illness (if I mentioned it to her she would, at best, get angry and tell me to grow up / stop being so self indulgent). I have two close friends who have their own problems to deal with. I'm seeing the doctor again on Monday but I fail to see what he can do to fix the fact that I am a useless failure. I am so scared and confused. I have been crying for about a week now and it's getting really tiring. I'm scared that maybe what I think is depression is really just an excuse to attempt to explain my pathetic behavior, that I am really a hypochondriac (my anxiety is now constant and I have convinced myself I am going to die any minute from any terminal illness you'd care to name) and I'm wasting the doc's time & resources. He offered me sleeping pills but I said no as I was afraid to have such things in the house. Basically, not a good week. Sorry to vent like this but I had to get it out  ...  sorry for being so selfish.

"Hi everyone. I am also a new member. I'm 22 years old and a single mother of one. I have had bipolar tendencies since I was a young child and was diagnosed at 16 or 17. The past few years since my daughter was born have been the best ones for my moods. I attribute part of that to the success I seemed to have on Lithium for two years. I stupidly went off the medicines and my thyroid medicines as well in November without telling my doctor. Lately things have gotten fairly rough. I know I have to get back in to the doctor, and I will. It's just that my life is so busy right now that it's hard to find the time (and the courage!). I'm glad I found this great site.

Just cut off all of my friends and I’m feeling alone and regretful Posted this to r/advice but I think that wasn’t the right place for it.   I just cut ties with nine people who I considered “family” for almost 10 years. Their negativity and inability to understand what I’m working towards has literally taken a huge toll on myself. ‪Friends are supppsed to support you through the good and the bad but instead I was being anchored and every time I felt I was getting out of it I was pulled back down.  ‬The fact that I was so attached to them made this one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do in my life and it took every ounce of myself to finish telling them I didn’t want anything to do with them. They don’t understand that in order for me to become a doctor I have to commit a lot of time to my studies. But if I can’t show up to something such as drinking I get absolutely torn apart by them. It’s like they hate when I’m productive but they enjoy seeing me partake in stupid shit. They’ve told me that I’m a liar and a terrible friend on numerous occasions and it’s just too hard to even reason with them at this point. Did I over react and should I iron things out with them? It’s just since I was so attached to them I don’t know how to deal with this situation.

"Hi everyone, I am new to this site and my name is Elie. I am a 38-year-old married mother of three girls and one angel baby boy who was born still 10/30/2003. My children's ages are 18 years old, 15 years old then it would have been Conner Charles. When we lost Conner due to an underlying infection and when I had the amniocentesis the infection got to Conner and he died a month later. That was very devastating to us but I have had a lot of support with an infant grief group in our area. After we lost Conner three months later we got pregnant with Charlene and she is so beautiful. Anyway things were going good (oh I forgot to mention the fact I remarried my ex husband. We were divorced for 14 years and we got back together). One day when the baby was 11 months old my husband accidentally spilled hot coffee onto Charlene's leg and she had a blanket sleeper on so she wasn't that bad. It was bad enough but because of the way the burn looked (due to the absorption of the stupid hot coffee) the doctor had her removed from our care until they could further decide if the baby was abused. I was dumbfounded; I have known this doctor for 17 hears with my girls Marissa and Jessica, so how dare he. I was so upset, but we have a DSS worker in our lives because of my middle daughter who has mental retardation, she is in a residential home because of her behaviors which in a way was excellent for us. Our worker seen and knew Charlene before the foster care and then when she finally saw her at foster care she did everything in her power to get the baby back and we did six days later. We are constantly in and out of court now because of this and then my husband was feeding the baby oatmeal and I was warning him to be careful she flails her arms, well she flailed and knocked the spoon out of his hand and the clump of oatmeal landed on her face ... we cleaned her up not noting anything bad as she didn't cry or nothing she wanted to eat. She ended up with a blister on her cheek in the spot that the oatmeal touched. We almost lost Charlene again. I went into DSS and said my husband was no longer going to be in charge of the baby and they felt better and I also said he wants parenting classes and they liked that idea. But this is my problem, how do I get passed this. I have a counselor already but you can never have too much support so I came to this web site. I can't even make love with my husband anymore. I resent him for putting me through this when I have been the most careful mother around. We also live with his mother because financially things are tight and right now its better we do because DSS notes it is a very supportive environment and I have a lot of help which I do but I can't leave otherwise I will have DSS up my back quite often. My husband feels that sex is the cure all to depression, he keeps hounding me and hounding me and I just don't want sex. When we first got back together this second time around things were awesome and we had so much fun but then we lost Conner, then had Charlene and then these burns and losing her and going to court. I have no say whatsoever even in my own room which depresses me but soon I will try and figure out how to get out of this. All I know is my husband better respect my wishes, I just can't make love at the moment. The last time was four weeks ago. Ok that's about it for now, that's about the main stuff I am dealing with for now.

Awesome!   Later that night I get a text... she doesn't think it will work out in the long run. I ask her why and she says we both have very different plans with our future, she's still getting over another break up, etc... Well that sucks, but I understand.

"They told me that all they can do is replace my hard drive, but they can't recover my 10 years of bitter-sweet memories. So I bought an external hard drive, thinking that everything would be safe on it, right? If I'm gonna spend $50 on something, it should at least be good at something, right?  So I exported every thing from the past 10 years onto it. Recently, my computer can't even read the hard drive anymore. I went to the customer help service and they said that they can't do anything to access my data and all they can do is replace it (within warranty).  All my graduation photos, friend hang outs, and all just precious moments, will have to go. I've always been looked down upon. I was never up to standard to anyone.

"I'm trying to go back to school after dropping out of college many years back, and I've got this real supportive boyfriend who wants to help me. Problem is, he's got this need for me to go out there and change the world. He keeps saying I need to be better than everyone in my class, and that I need to be hyper - prepared before I even start class. I don't mind boning up on the class material beforehand, but he wants to help me come up with theses and bring those to my undergrad profs for help, and he wants me to read a whole bunch of texts from my chosen field before the semester starts. He also wants me to study anatomy because, as he says ""anatomy doesn't really change"", so I can be the ""go to"" person with whom all my classmates will want to study. I'm really bright and would like to make something out of myself, but he's got such high hopes and he wants me to do way too much way too soon. I don't even know for certain what I want to be at this point - getting back into the liberal arts program just seems like a good start towards deciding and acting. All this pressure from him is making it hard for me to even take the baby steps I need to take to make anything at all happen. When I try to tell him it's too much pressure, we wind up in a shouting argument (actually, I wind up doing most of the shouting - he just has this way of pressing my buttons.) I've spent my whole life as an inactive perfectionist, and all this from him just makes it hard to break free from that. Meanwhile, he's afraid that I'm going to spend my life playing video games (a reasonable fear at the moment.) He keeps saying lately that I need to move out of childhood, but he wants to parent me. rrbleh..  is there some way to just move around him without having all these arguments, and without letting him pressure me?

"My story, i have to get this off my chest. Life sucks Hello everyone,  This is a post about my life basically, i just need to get this off my chest. Its a long post but i just have to do this.  Let me introduce myself first. Currently im a 19yo boy who turns 20 in March, I live in Belgium (grammar will be bad sorry).  I have 1 older brother,  2 loving parents who are still together. And oh yeahh i have a very cute pupper as well. Financially everything is fine.  Basically a family some people only can dream for. I mainly play on nintendo consoles (switch, 3ds, gba, n64) and the MMORPG runescape (dont laugh :)) I consider myself a extravert to my friends but an introvert when im talking to girls (lol) or strangers.  I've always had a rough time fitting at school. Our elementary school was VERY SMALL, it only had 75 kids (including kindergarden). I was always the ""odd one out"", but because it was so small i had 1 friend. We played alot together and it was a ok time really. but when i was 5 most people around me started to notice that i made weird random noises. And that i made small movements with my shoulders (unnatural ones). Friends got annoyed, parents got annoyed, everyone got annoyed. Eventually my teacher screamed at me telling me to shut up, RIP ME.  Eventually mom took me to a specialist and it turned out i have Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, if you youtube this you will get extreme cases where people shout fuck and ass, and move uncontrollably all over the place. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH ME. I think Tourette affected my life ALOT (it still does!!). I was always a really shy kid until i was 11, i started to accept my tourettes and was a happy 11yo. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **HIGH SCHOOL** (from 12 to 18yo, its devided in 6 ""classes"".  This is where the problems started, when i just started high school i was scared but excited like everyone. Unfortunately for me i got the SHITTIEST bullies in my class. I had no friends in year 1, they made fun of me becuz of my tourettes (i didnt tell them becuz they wouldnt understand). It got to a point where i just smacked someone on the head with a baseball bat. Teachers knew of my situation so we both got 1 week detention. I was ""depressed"" during that year, you know the teenage life, its hard. Year 2 they changed me to another class and they were OK. They didnt bully me but they didnt talk to me either. They just left me alone really, during those 2 years i had 1 friend who i talked with but he also had his own friends. So most of the time i was alone. But that friend had no common interests, so i ended up playing runescape all day, u can talk with other players there and i had plenty of friends in there. It felt awesome to have friends and i spent all my time there neglecting my studies. But somehow i passed  the first 2 years lol.  I thought year 1 was bad, but then i met year 3 (different school). I got bullied even more in this class, they called me names, ignored me, humiliated me in class and started bitching if they had to sit next to me. Luckily they never got fysical with me (idk if thats the right word). In the middle of that year I decided   in the middle of the fucking winter (it was snowing) in morning to take the bus (mom was always home and it was near our house) and to step of early. Spent 2 hours in a small freezing cold chapel playing on my nintendo 3ds, go to my house after mom left and spend playing games in my room.  After 3 days the school called, my mom found out. I was stuck and told her everything about the bullying, about me feeling like absolute shit and that i had no motivation to go to school. She let the teachers know, went to school, got me to a psychiatrist. The bullying stopped, but they still ignored me, i still hadnt any friends and i still didnt feel any better. I somehow survived the 4 next months and passed. If i had 1.1% lower in total i would have failed that year.  The only way i felt better was with playing runescape.  YEAR 4-6 IS IN THE SAME CLASS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE, in year 5 three people joined Year 4 kinda went the same as year 2 believe it or not. The classmates were ok, they didnt bully me, they talked to me when needed but that was it. I spent my time with some kids i met on the playground. But u know they were those kind of friends u just spent time with becuz nobody else is around. They never invited me to go to parties or to hang around or anything. This year was also the 1st year i told them about my Tourette Syndrome ( i got some damn weird looks at times and i didnt even realize i was making sounds). They understood, they acted more nice to me, i didnt feel left out so much but was still unhappy. And on runescape i got into a community (clan), made some good friends there. It was the only place in the word i was truly happy.   Year 5, same class as last year. 3 people joined and 1 of them became a friend of mine. To be completely honest he is still one of my best friends today, but i come back to that later. Lets call him J, Ok so now i had a friend. We had a small group of 3 people now, S (other classmate who was nice to me), J and me. 2 others from another class joined the group somehow and i finally made some friends. We started going to parties and they invited me. Unlucky for me they dont play runescape and have different interests in gaming, thanks to this im not that close to them. But i was finally starting to be happy becuz i had friends.  All the small things that bothered me (sitting alone, always last chosen at sports etc etc...), bothered me alot less becuz i was super happy i finally found something positive in my life. I survived year 5 and 6 fairly positive compared to year 1 and 3. We all graduated and college time arrived ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **COLLEGE** This was last year, so this is super recent. I decided to study ""orthopedagogie"", it doesnt have an english translation. Its working with mentally disabled people or troubled young people, stuff like that. Ofcourse I begged my parents for a student room, i wanted to have a great college life like in the movies! Everyone says its the best time of your life and you should enjoy it to the fullest. Oh boy i was so so dumb for believing it would be that easy. And ofcourse i also joined a society. Finally growing up like an adult and living alone, I WAS FREEEEEEEEEEE. In my class i got along with most of them, we had some good laughs during breaks, went to our class etc... but i was the only one who had a student room (unlucky). So ye that was that. In my society i tried making friends, but it didnt work out really. I missed some first important parties becuz i decided to go with some classmates (i still think to this day that this was a huge mistake), when i went to parties alone to make friends  (because i realized my class was lame) they already a ""friend group"". I didnt know (and still dont) how to make contact with them and make friends.  I was really really really lonely last year, i just spent all my time playing runescape, talking with my online friends. November 2016 i met someone and we became super super super super close. (he is american, not lovers just friends). We still talk to each other everyday. Man we even were planning to go to japan together but my mom wont let me. But coming back to that later. During the weekends i had my old friend group from highschool, we still hang out 2x per month, we still do. But they mostly spent time studying and hanging out with their uni friends. They didnt left me out or anything but i had lost alot of contact with them. I failed 50% of my courses, i decided to call it quits. I was happy that i could finally leave that student room. uni year 1 was HORRIBLE.  I liked the study i was doing, so i decided to try it again but in a lower degree, its in a school for adults (18+). Its hard to explain but basically i ended up with 60% out of 20 people to be 30+ and have kids. It was class 1x a week and internship (idk if thats the right word) 2.5 days per week. I was working with adults who had a mental disability. Last year i never had internship, only class. It turns out that Orthopedagogie is not the study for me. I dont want to do this the rest of my life. I had officially quit november 2017.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  We finally arrived to the present time, thank you for the people that made it here.   So here i am, a 19 year old boy (almost 20), wasted 1.5 years in uni, wasting parents money... I have no idea what i want to study next... The only study i consider doing is social work, luckily for me u can start in february. So i have to do some shitty job from november - february. I still have my highschool friends who i hang out with 2x per month? I have a loving brother and parents, good financial situation. I can earn some quick cash for 3 months and go back to study. But to be completely honest... I DONT SEE THE FUCKING POINT.  My whole life i have felt lonely, sometimes with a good reason, sometimes really without a reason. I have dealt with ""depression"" (not officially diagnosed), or atleast felt like i was.  To be completelty honest. I feel like a sad little fucking sack of shit. What have i achieved in my life? Fucking nothing. I cant even think like a fucking normal person, people think im weird, i dont have logical sense. Everyday i have to force myself out of bed. Its been like this for so long now that im starting to get used to it. Even now that i dont have a job until feb, i simply dont have the strength to get out of bed. I sleep 12 hrs per day just so the day passes by faster.  I dont feel like going out, i dont feel like talking to people. Runescape was always my escape, but i simply do not have the motivation to even play runescape . On the outside i still act normal, i laugh and act like everything is fine so my parents wont worry. Whenever i have a job they fire me because ""i work to slow"". Once i worked in a storage for a store and had to get the order from customers. You have to use ""common sense"" all the time, and they said i didnt have that enough for this job. This happened 3x...   Remember when i said that i have tourette syndrome, well i always told myself that it also does have a ""mental"" side to it. I can come across different then the ""normal person"", or use the wrong word in sentences to express myself. And i interpret things differently at times, i usually need to hear the explanation multiple times and they have to explain it very clearly.  My parents just said im a slow learner but with ""hard work i get there"". This fucked me over so many times in life, and whenever i tell people/friends about the mental side of tourette they all have that expression on their face. The face of ""ohh that explains alot, but i also feel so sorry for you"". Im so fucking sick of it, im not even sure if this happens becuz of my tourette. Im really starting to think this is just all in my head and that im just retarded. (my iq is average tho). I often imagine myself having some disorder to make myself feel better, i really dont know what to do with myself. I feel like an absolute loser who cant even think like a normal person. Last 6 months i bought myself a nintendo switch + some games to cheer myself up. it gets me trough some days but in the end i still end up having no energy to get out of bed.  BUT i feel like an arrogant asshole writing this, i have nothing to complain about... Alot of people had the worst childhood, or had a traumatic experience... I have a family many people can only dream of? financially im good. I have the chance to try studying again.... I HAVE NO REASON TO FEEL THIS WAY AND IT MAKES ME GO INSANE. Im having alot of negative thoughts, and i cant get them out of my head. I dont see the light in the end of the tunnel. (Not stuff like suicide or self cutting btw).  As i said earlier i met someone a year ago trough rs. I can always talk to him, i never met him in person but we discord at times and message each other everyday. I feel more connected to him than my IRL friends. They have no same interests, other life goals... How sad is that? Fkn someone i met online is my best friend? He is the only 1 that knows how i feel but he doesnt understand how i feel. He tries to support me, but it doesnt help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Im not making this post so everyone feels bad for me.... Im just so sick of life... I dont know what to do... My parents have their own problems and think im over exaggerating... ""Grow up son? Everyone has to get a job"" ""Grow up for once"". But they dont know what it feel like to drag yourself trough the whole day 24/7 (atleast i hope they dont). They think im just lazy and dont want to work... I feel isolated from the world and i cant get out of it.  Ok god damnit im re-reading this post, at this point im just rambling... Idk what i expect from posting this here... Maybe its just to give my empty brain a boost...  I will just end this post now or i keep adding stuff.

"I often ponder the idea of giving up completely. Has anyone given up completely? How does it feel like?   I have had extreme depression for 11 years. For as long as I can remember I have tried so hard to stay alive. There was a point in my life where I gave up. I remember my mom was beating me and I put up my hands to block the belt and I was crying. I remember after one of the times she struck me I started to think “what if I gave up?” And I just shut down. In that moment I stopped putting my hands up, stopped crying, and rolled into a ball while mom kept beating me for a few more minutes.   For a few years after that I stopped caring about my appearance. I got so fat and I just kept eating and eating. I stopped caring about my grades and didn’t even try. I would just turn in a blank paper with my name on it.   During high school I woke up and started to try again even though it was really hard. Since then I haven’t stopped. I regularly do thing I don’t want to do in an effort to make it by. I get up at 5, I shower every day, I go to the gym, I do my homework, study, etc.   Currently, I have been working my butt off to be able to join the military to get away from my parents. My depression is acting up so much, it’s getting really hard to keep trying. I often find myself daydreaming and pondering how good/easy it would feel/be to just stop what I’m doing and give up. Get in bed, stay in bed, go eat, eat some more, and more, finally not caring about my appearance and just not doing anything in general.

"We were all given about five minutes to decipher what the fuck this meant. Now, Mr. Runge had a reputation for being a tough teacher. He wouldn't let you get away with ANYTHING. If you fell asleep in his class because you were out all night in some cornfield with a bonfire and a bottle of Jack, he'd kick your desk in such a way that your head would fly upward at warp speed and your hangover would instantly get very very bad, and then suddenly disappear. Mr. Runge had some freaky special power that students couldn't tap into. I knew what the acronym stood for. But that's only because my high school boyfriend was a year ahead of me and gave me a heads up on how the first day with the Jolly Green Giant would play out. ""He's going to write this on the board, make you feel incredibly stupid and then it will be over."" TINSTAAFL, pronounced TinStaffel. There Is No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. Runge went on to explain that ""free"" didn't exist. The ""free"" lunches at college tours were paid for when your parents registered you were charged a ""service"" fee. Or, more on my level, Clinique never REALLY has a ""Free Gift with Purchase"". Because, you see...you have to make the purchase, dumb ass! And they over charge every other product just enough so that you're really paying for your ""free"" gift. This burst my bubble. Because now, whenever I take something marketed as free, I know I'm paying some sort of overhead or some poor schmuck is working extra hard so that I can get 2.5 ounces more of my favorite shampoo for the price of the regular size! You would think that I would have held on to this knowledge while looking for apartments. While scanning the ads, I bypassed the ones that used words like ""full of character"", because I knew that meant dump and ""TLC needed"", because I knew that meant dump. The one I honed in on boasted country living, quiet, serene, pond, lots o' land and everything included! I love where I live. I can't say it enough. If I didn't think raccoons would eat me at this hour, I'd jump on top of the roof and scream to the surrounding hills ""I love you and all your coniferous smells and the creatures you shelter!"" (Yeah, apparently the rooftop would make me a tad wordy.) My landlords are awesome people. Salt of the earth. Nice, down-home, trusting folk. And, as the contract for country people reads, ""Coon Hounds Must Be Owned and Bred"". I had never seen a breed of this type until I moved here. The momma dog was so sweet and gentle and quiet. She was quite the fatty too! Then suddenly she wasn't. And in her pen were ten little squeaky pups, eyes shut tight, blindly falling into food and water dishes, only to be rescued by momma. Cute, no? Who doesn't love puppies?? (If you bring Jackson up, I'll have to cut you.) It's been about month. Puppies have found their voices. All ten of them. And even the momma is begging for a release. Tigger is in the window, constantly doing a head count to make sure everyone is in their place and not a single one wanders off into oblivion. He's exhausted. Momma is exhausted because at night she performs a constant howl that cracks my heart. She's begging to be released from those needy fucking kids for at least ONE night of respite. And I'm exhausted. Because momma won't shut up and deal with her fate and every time a puppy so much as peeps, gaymancat is all over my head doing a get-up-because-they-might-run-into-traffic-and-get-hit-by-one-of-the-four-cars-that-pass-by-here-at-night dance.

"In a bad headspace after a breakup with someone who finally made me feel like things would be okay It’s been a week since I returned from a six month exchange program overseas. There, I ended a 2y relationship with an addict, who I still cared for but could not love anymore. Then, of course, I fell in love with someone. We were inseparable for the six months. As I struggle with depression, anxiety and schizoaffective disorder, it hasn’t been the easiest for him.   We planned to end our relationship and continue as friends, but just couldn’t bear to at the departure gates. We decided to try a long distance relationship, but after a week, he’s had enough of me. He has his own problems, and we live 20 hours apart with a 12h time difference, so I don’t blame him at all. I do however carry a lot of resentment for myself for being so down in the past week and pushing him.   I used to be really sociable, but a multitude of issues have led me to slowly isolate myself from people. I still have friends, but they either don’t actually gaf or they have their own problems and I don’t want to add on to their burdens. It’s also very difficult for me to meet people without any alcohol or drugs to calm the anxiety—something I’m trying to stay away from as my addiction problems have led me to the psych ward. Besides, how much can friends be there for you? It’s you alone in your bed staring at the ceiling til noon the next day for days on end (I’ve had terrible insomnia since coming home).   I’m still on school break, cannot really occupy my mind by going outside to meet friends or take a part time job or just walk around due to anxiety and psychosis, and all the things I used to watch/do to cheer myself up (music, slam poetry, writing, youtube, netflix, games) I have associated very strongly with him as we have very similar habits. So anything that could make me pass the time makes me sad.   I’ve loved and lost many times and I know it gets better eventually, but currently it gets very very dark in my mind and I’m not sure what I can do to survive in the meantime. I’m in a very bad place and feel very anhedonic and suicidal thoughts are back (having been accumulated from all these problems). He was the one person that made me feel like someone understood and was there in this big bad world, and without him I feel like I’m floating and nothing will make me feel okay again for a long time.

"I've been having a difficult time lately. In addition to my mental state of disarray, I have a medical condition that can affect my mood. My medication has changed lately; my body hasn't caught up the difference yet. The last few days have been particularly bad, especially at night. The familiar sensation lurks again on my upper leg. Scissors. Half-dozen lines -- my usual, though in the past I would sometimes keep cutting until my self-hatred was momentarily spent. Pressure on the blade to force the skin to gape slightly and bleed more. I am not proud. I knew it wasn't the best way to cope. I did at least take the precautions of using a sharp blade, knowing that a jagged blade could leave a jagged wound, and of lavish aftercare. I washed it out with rubbing alcohol, which causes renewed bleeding but was necessary to keep everything clean and infection-free. Covered everything with a jumbo Band-Aid, the kind kids put on skinned knees, and haven't dared to look since. Afterward, I was afraid that I was back to my old ways. I told myself in near-hysterics that this was strictly a one-time backslide. The surprising part is that I believed myself. This does not make me a cutter again. This does not mean that I have lost everything that I've gained. All it means is that I have been having an extraordinarily bad time and resorted to extraordinary behavior in order to cope. My situation will improve. My body chemistry will even out. It's better not to cut, but I am not a bad person even if I do cut. The words are stupidly simple. I don't care.

"I want to pay off my debt then kill myself. I came from a really poor family, worked hard during primary and secondary school. Got a scholarship for college which paid me 10k a year as well as covering my school fees. Gave parents the money, it paid for the bills as well as my siblings's school fees. Thought life was good, studying what i love. However, i got bullied until i cant take it anymore and requested a change of class, the school rejected my request. I then requested to take a semester off school, but the contract for the scholarship states that i have to complete school by 3 years or the contract will be terminated. Failed a module and i have to extend my time in college by a year, which caused my scholarship to be terminated. Which in turn placed me in a 30k debt. Now, i don't have money to pay for school, so i had to leave. Im out without any qualifications except for a secondary school cert, with the organisation that offered me the scholarship requesting 1k per month for installments.    I've always looked forward to my dream job, i was so close, i volunteer every weekend to get experience from that job. Now it feels like everything is taken from me. I appealed to have my scholarship reinstated 3 times, explaining the issues that i had, giving them the medical reports from my doctors, bringing up the volunteer work i did. But on the latest attempt, i got a call saying that they never planned to accept my appeal. It really feels like everything is taken from me. I feel like just working to pay off my debt so as to not burden my family as the debtors will go for them if i die now.

I Could Use Some Support Right Now Yesterday my best friend of five years attempted to kill their self. I'm currently being blown away by school (grad school if it really matters). I don't know what to think at all. This is midterm week and most my profs are understanding but the one class I'm worried about the prof gave me the option of writing and being stuck with whatever mark I get or not writing and the weight being shifted onto my final but I need the feedback to decide if I'm going to even stay in the course because it's incredibly difficult. It just feels like nothing is going my way currently and it's so hard to study or focus. side note; another prof let me write as  told them (like I did the other) that I wanted it as a distraction and said that if I did bad they'd shift the weight to my final. ,use support right yesterday best friend year attempted kill self currently blown away school grad school really matter not know think all midterm week prof understanding class worried prof gave option writing stuck mark not writing weight shifted final need feedback decide going stay course incredibly difficult just feel like going way currently hard study focus note prof let write told like did other wanted distraction said did bad shift weight final,0.38272982835769653,0.4860955774784088,0.4852001368999481
"I think I may have been on this forum (it looked different) back in 2002 when I had a major bout with depression and anxiety due to some serious financial worries. I've always been prone to this I guess, but I'm starting to figure out that it's big, nasty life-changes that trigger it. Well, here I go again. This time it's relationship-related. My wife and I are on brink of divorce. I found out almost a year ago that she has been emotionally involved with another man, and was no longer ""in-love"" with me. We somehow muddled through the next several months, even though I found out it was still going on, we kept ""trying"" anyway, and things were still tolerable and ok, I guess. (We still shared same bed, got affectionate, cuddled and even made love). About 3 weeks ago, I discovered that it still had not ended, and they were actually conspiring on getting together in March. Well, all hell broke loose and things got worse than ever. I'm now in a separate room, sleeping on a single bed, and I'm miserable. I resumed Wellbutrin when this all started last spring (I took Wellbutrin for about 9 months when I had my episode in 2002), and have been taking it since. But since this really bad turn of events, I knew I couldn't take it, and to be honest, even before I discovered again, my therapist told me that I need to revisit my doctor and prescriptions because I've got some serious anxiety issues. So now I just started Zoloft (25mg/day) in addition to the Wellbutrin. I don't know how things are going to turn out. I'm in ""limbo"" while I give her ""time and space to figure things out."" The Zoloft I think started to kick in today, but not in a good way. I'm actually feeling MORE depressed when I came in this morning...I almost broke down crying in front of my computer -argh! My mood swings are horrible. All I can think about is going home and crawling into my bed and taking an Ambien, even though I hate that bed and want to be in the big bed with my wife. I almost wish at times that she would just say, ""That's it, we're done"", so I can know what is going on and just move on with my life. I may end up single and lonely anyway, but at least I'll have the opportunity to look for someone else. Right now I feel like a prisoner, being starved of basic human needs, like hugs, touches, affection. (Doesn't that sound lame from a guy???????  ) Well, anyway, here I am....here for the ride....",think forum it looked different major bout depression anxiety financial worry prone guess starting figure big nasty lifechanges trigger it well again time relationshiprelated wife brink divorce year ago emotionally involved man longer inlove me muddled month going on kept trying anyway thing tolerable ok guess we shared bed got affectionate cuddled love week ago discovered not ended actually conspiring getting march well hell broke loose thing got worse ever separate room sleeping single bed miserable resumed wellbutrin started spring i took wellbutrin month episode taking since really bad turn event knew not it honest discovered again therapist told need revisit doctor prescription got anxiety issue just started zoloft mgday addition wellbutrin not know thing going turn out limbo time space figure thing out zoloft think started kick today not good way actually feeling depressed came morningi broke cry computer argh mood swing horrible think going home crawling bed taking ambien hate bed want big bed wife wish time just say that it done know going just life end single lonely anyway opportunity look else right feel like prisoner starved basic human need like hug touch affection doe not sound lame guy well anyway amhere ride,0.4066498577594757,0.3984232544898987,0.47354856133461

"Well, a little update then. For those who don't know me that well yet, (which is everybody I suppose) I'm the 20 (almost 21) year old that chose to take a break from school, due to pff what'll it be? Anxiety, depression, health problems regarding sleep/energy. I tried it again at some point, but after 2 weeks found myself to be, not cured yet. I figured it had to end, so I went looking for help. Social worker, well that's all nice and stuff, but not too helpful. Then the official psychiatrists. Well let's pick up from there; the first one, in the Adolescents department directed me to another shrink after the first intake meeting, my help question; not sure. But something was keeping me from being able to fit in the system. I also had concentration problems but she didn't want to dig into that. So this new shrink, on a different department, made me fill in some forms and we had some talks (2) and well, apparently the concentration problem IS a big issue and causing a lot of damage as well as my past (divorced parents, being bullied all my life etc etc.) Okay fine, so I says; maybe I need something to help me sleep? And she suggested I go see my house doctor and ask for sleeping medicines. Which I got, and used for two weeks now and ...nothing. Well, the first 2 days were good, the 2 after that were less good, and I don't even remember the ones after that. I woke up automatically, and sometimes sleep was okay. But after 2 weeks I'm still SO tired everyday, it's killing me. I try and keep up a new rhythm, but it's so exhausting and I feel like doing all sorts of happy things but I just don't have the energy and then I go do it anyway and I end up so hurt and tired. Now, I can't take the medicines for more than two weeks, so today was going to be my last. Well, I sort of should have read the booklet I got with it before use. It said I shouldn't take them EVERY day but every other day, and like I don't know, it says it builds up and stays in your body. Well, I'm fine don't worry. They warned about some side effects, but I seem to have been okay. However, the side effects include ALL the things I already suffered from BEFORE even taking the darn medicines!!! So it's been a complete and utter waste. This one day, I tried sleeping without medicines, and I just couldn't...just, can't fall asleep. So yeah, I had that talk with yet another shrink today, and now he wants me to see some other person. And he thinks I SHOULDN'T take sleeping medicines. So like, ARGH, people keep telling me opposite things, and now they want me to see this person, who'll help me fill in my days and get organized??? That's all cool and well and all, but I got there myself already. I figured it all out before I even started seeing these ""professionals"" and now they're telling me what I already came up with on my own??? It's another 3 week wait. And I don't know anymore. I'm confused about all this, and beginning to think it's been a huge mistake in the first place. And now that it's Spring again, I'm feeling sort of happy. So depression is still here, but, I don't notice it much...or do I? I'm still feeling so alone and my family still doesn't get me...I just want out, I just want to be away from here, which brings us back to the original problem. I'm so annoyed, and after this, today is just going to be another day that I just don't do anything useful... Sure I want to go back to school, but it takes time...I have some time, then again I don't... I had so many plans, and ARGH this sleeping problem, which is going to be my main focus now, is just so darn annoying. I could listen to countless pieces of advice, but in the end, it's just no good to me... Even the stupid sleeping medicines don't work...And every time I go see a shrink about one problem, they point me to someone else, and then another problem bothers me and they send me back but that still didn't fix my first problem. I'm like, fine I'll go fix this darn problem myself then. (I really feel like cursing, but I won't because it's not proper so I'll release some rage when I'm done here, but just know that I'm really upset and annoyed). After all, it was me who had to fix everything all my life right? So I might as well start now... haha such a laugh, I'll procrastinate till the day I die... So very tired. I can't do a thing... ugh, I'm so sick of it. I want to go sleep now, but I just know I'll wake up late in the evening and won't be able to sleep tonight.

"Law of Attraction is bullshit. Also hard work doesn't pay off. Everything in life is based on chance and luck only.   Our society preaches the fiction of hard work paying off because we need most expandable people to work hard, so that the rest can just chill and live off their backs.  Also every fucking motivational coach and self-help guide is a fucking scam. Focusing your goals, working hard and putting effort in to achieve them? Yeah, tell that to people with terminal diseases or people living in poverty without the chance to ever get better, people dying of famine or living in war zones.   Tell that to the legions of people who didn't make the cut and never will.

"I always wanted to go to the therapy but my very huge and overprotective gossip-loving family made this impossible for me to do Not only that but even a little hypothetical talk about it would instantly gain unnecessary panic like attention and after several phone calls to friends, family members with something like *""Hey Clara, he wants to go to the therapist. Is this normal? Which one should we call? Do you know anyone? Ask John please!""* And next day there will be several people touching my hand and saying ""Hey are you fine?"" Making it feel like something is wrong with me when I just want to talk to a professional in person without feeling like a babe.   How do I know? Because my sister was depressed once and I've seen how everyone reacted to it. You see, my family's  never changing mentality is ""we need to fight together! We are there for you (goddamn Fairy Tail guild or something)"". I don't blame them and I bet there are people who'd exchange everything only to be with someone as supportive. But I have always hated attention so much since I remember my self as a kid. Ironically enough I've had the biggest birthday parties in the town to boost this 'weird' hate.   Doing it secretly will be risky because I actually work in my family's business as well so my tight schedule and the fact that my town is pretty small makes this almost impossible. And if someone finds out I secretly go to talk to a doctor it will have even worse reaction than just straight out telling them.   Maybe I'm overreacting and have too much pride in me or no balls to admit to my family but sometimes I wish I could get invisible for just a week to sort my inner problems out. Sorry If this feels like I'm trying to make it harder for you guys to make some suggestions. It's way more complicated than that I just wanted to let it out. I've read some posts here and some of them were so so dark that my problems actually fade away a bit and I felt better because I said to my self *""yo... you are being a bitch right now, look at these people suffering here, you aren't even close!""* (don't know if I'm being terrible for healing my little wounds by reading how other people suffer). Anyways, Idk why I haven't visited this sub earlier, as I type these last words I already feel better because it is the first time I'm doing something like this. Feels like I've talked to someone.

"Journal Entry - 12:23AM Monday, December 4th, 2017 Just thought I'd share my thoughts from last night. I occasionally lurk Reddit looking for a relatable story, so I figured I'd share some of my own thoughts.  I don't want a job.   The hardest part of having a job is talking. It's bad enough that I have to make eye contact. Having to speak on top of that can be nerve wrecking.   Meeting new people is also tough. It's even tougher when you're the new one. Who are these people? Do I even want to know you? Are you going to try and get to know me? Am I going to allow it?  Customers are easier to deal with, but just a drag to have to deal with. It can be monotonous. Often, it’s annoying. But all the while, I just feel drained.   There are good days at work. But there are also bad days. And those bad days make the lasting impression, in my experience.   I'm thankful for those good days. But the bad days remind me that I want better for myself.  I'm tired of working in restaurants. I'm tired of wearing a stupid hat my hair can barely fit under. I'm tired of repeating phrases I'm told to repeat. I'm tired of seeing the disgusting process of how people’s shitty food is prepared. I'm tired of cooking, something I enjoy, feeling soulless.   Historically, preparing a meal and feeding someone is a virtuous act, at least to me. The commoditization of it is a bit of a shame.  I detest consumerism, generally speaking. Customers are not my favorite people. Along with restaurants, I hope to avoid customer interaction at my next job.  I really don't want any job. When it comes to time &amp; energy vs. money, I'm all for the money until I find out what I have to do. Then my my time &amp; energy feels more valuable. Because it is more valuable.",journal entry am monday december th just thought share thought night occasionally lurk reddit looking relatable story figured share thought not want job hardest having job talking bad make eye contact having speak nerve wrecking meeting new people tough tougher new one people want know you going try know me going allow it customer easier deal with just drag deal with monotonous often annoying while just feel drained good day work bad day bad day make lasting impression experience thankful good day bad day remind want better myself tired working restaurant tired wearing stupid hat hair barely fit under tired repeating phrase told repeat tired seeing disgusting process people shitty food prepared tired cooking enjoy feeling soulless historically preparing meal feeding virtuous act me commoditization bit shame detest consumerism generally speaking customer not favorite people restaurant hope avoid customer interaction job really not want job come time amp energy v money money do time amp energy feel valuable valuable,0.4917389154434204,0.4113193154335022,0.4594738483428955
My roommate asked me move. My car died. And I put myself in the hospital. Girlfriend is over it and wants me to get my life together. With out without her. She doesn't want to be around me.  I'm ubering to my job at the moment. I just basically shut down at the start of sundown. Shut down and drank for 4 or 5 days with the last one with me on the phone with a rope on my neck.  I feel absolutely help less. Don't have money to pay rent. Don't have enough money to Uber to work.   My next logical step is to move back to my mother's. Which is not only depressing. She's just 40 minutes from everything.   I'm not even thinking suicide. I'm just thinking like life pretty much has a depressed shade over it. Probably from me recovering from withdrawal.  I don't want to move back to my mom's. To sit there away from everything I want to do. And now I gotta start over.

"I just need to get this off of my chest. This is my first time posting. I’m not sure if trigger warnings are common place here, but before you read on I would like to say warn that this mentions suicide.  A family member took their life last week and I’m really, really struggling.  I’m absolutely devastated that my children won’t be able to grow up with them around.   I’m struggling to keep it all together.  I just want to cry all day. But I don’t want my kids to see my crying.  Everyone around me is just carrying on like normal.  I have a history of depression, I’m currently in therapy and on medication. I feel like my family is wrapping me in cotton wool.  When I first found out how it happened, I obsessed over articles that described the process they would have went through while dying. I kept wondering what they were feeling in that moment... if during those last moments they had regret. Then I kept tormenting myself with the “what if?”  I’ve been able to stop doing those. But now... I just want to be a sloth. I want to sit on the couch and watch TV all day. All motivation I had prior to last week has just gone.   I’ve never had anyone this close to me die. A friend who I had grown apart from committed suicide last year. I was upset,.. but I wasn’t this upset.  Let me stress this - I am definitely not having any suicidal thoughts.   Due to the unexpected costs we’ve had, I can’t afford to see the psychologist, that’s why I’m posting here.  I’m just so devastated.",just need chest time posting not sure trigger warning common place here read like say warn mention suicide family member took life week really really struggling absolutely devastated child not able grow around struggling together just want day not want kid cry just carrying like normal history depression currently therapy medication feel like family wrapping cotton wool happened obsessed article described process went dying kept wondering feeling moment moment regret kept tormenting if able stop doing those now just want sloth want sit couch watch tv day motivation prior week just gone close die friend grown apart committed suicide year upset not upset let stress definitely not having suicidal thought unexpected cost had afford psychologist posting here just devastated,0.4375161826610565,0.47980985045433044,0.5519031882286072

"She stopped texting back Hi, i'm 19 and for as long as I remember I have always struggled with self-confidence and my depression. I rarely use tinder because I don't match with many people, I'm below average looking like but it doesn't help swiping for ages and rarely getting a match.   I know it's just a glorified hook up app for the most part but the other night I matched with a really cute girl who was way out of my league and we started talking, one thing leads to another and next thing I know we're up to after 2am talking about Pokémon of all things. I feel like there's a connection there so i ask her out and she says yes. It took alot to do this and it honestly made my month as the last few have been pretty meh.   We kept talking the next day and that evening she didn't reply to one my texts, I tried to think nothing of it because it wasn't really a question or anything and tried to restart the conversation but nothing again.   This morning I said Hi and she replied Hey back and then I asked her what she was up to and she just didn't reply again. I don't blame her if she isn't interested, that's fair enough it happens. She was sending x's up until she stopped texting back though and its not something i thought i was being naive about thinking she was interested in me but maybe i was wrong.   I kinda just wish i knew where i went wrong. I just feel so unattractive and like there's something wrong with me.

Stranger: id rather hit rock bottom then have no conciousness  You: hmm how old are you?  Stranger: 19  You: wow u look 30  Stranger: ik its the beard  You: u bang alot of pussy?

Stranger: id have to probably have a caretaker  Stranger: but thats situational  Stranger: and if i do end up like that im not sure how id be alive after  You: let's say you're fine somehow, but u live in poverty and have no friends or family  You: now do u still live?  Stranger: i mean thats more of a situation where suicide is more reasonable  Stranger: idk how ud do it tho  Stranger: id dprobably just go into a homeless shelter or something  Stranger: by rolling?  You: haha  Stranger: hopping?  Stranger: not sure  You: ok, but wouldn't u be extremely depressed and miserabl all the time. how could u find joy in such an existence?  Stranger: hmmmm  Stranger: youd probably learn to cope  Stranger: either that or id attempt to get pain meds  Stranger: and mauybe od eventually  You: no but how, like all u can do is sit around. maybe watch tv or go outside and watch birds fly and shit on your head.

Stranger: like random ass things  You: yeah, so i get temporarily happy for sure. but long term it just fades away and im back to being miserable  Stranger: maybe its just a loop of thoughts?  Stranger: like anxious/depressed thoughts  Stranger: also do you live alone?  You: yeah  You: no with my roomates currently  Stranger: that could be some of the lonliness  Stranger: oh okay  Stranger: idk i kinda view life as a thing which you might as well have  Stranger: even if things are shitty  Stranger: because once you leave you cant just come back  Stranger: so you kight as well experience evrything you can experience  Stranger: even if it sucks  Stranger: cuz some things dont  Stranger: and those are worth living for  You: hmm ok. i guess accepting how life is has been the difficult part  Stranger: very understandable  Stranger: humans created a system of working and living on less of a survival mode, which has created so much boredom  Stranger: like living isnt that hard, so what do we do now?  Stranger: but that allows us to do many things other animals cant, but its still kind of dreary  You: yes indeed. that's very true  You: it's hard to know what to do  Stranger: it really is  Stranger: too many options  Stranger: have you taken acid/shrooms before?

Stranger: id say just keep going, if things seem bad now just realize how many times youve reached a breaking point in your life, for whatever reason, and that youre still here lol  Stranger: also, just keep trying new things, and doing whatever, because what does it matter anyways?  Stranger: and if you seriously feel depressed, consider going to a doctor/therapist, as there could be less serotonin in your brain that the average person  Stranger: is that helpful at all lol  You: yes, it's nice to hear someone else who has thought about these things. and who can give an honest opinion  Stranger: i believe in u man  Stranger: u still there?

"I'm a daca recipient and I fucking hate it. I was born in Mexico and brought to the US when I was 3. This of course means I'm one of those ""nasty illegals"" everyone seems to hate.  My goal has always been success. Ever since I was a kid I daydreamed of owning a mansion with fancy gates, a huge lawn, a big pool. This was always my goal. I wasn't going to accept living in poverty like my parents or having an ""average"" life. So I worked hard for it. I was always top of my class, I was on the dean's honor list in college, I started (and failed) my first few businesses, joined clubs, went to a lot of events to meet people, and landed an internship. I was even in the middle of starting my next business. I also got my credit score up to almost 800 and started funding my retirement/investment account.  Because my whole life has been focused on success, I attempted suicide a few times when I found out I was illegal and couldn't even go to college in high school. Obviously they all failed. However in 2012, the year before I graduated, Obama passed daca. Because I had been here since I was a toddler, was going to finish school, and didn't have even a single misdemeanor, I was able to get a social security number, a work permit, a driver's license, open investment accounts, and received protection from deportation.  Now Trump has ended it. The final decision will be made in early August, but it's most likely going to be rescinded. What am I supposed to do then? Just fucking accept losing everything? Everything I worked towards will have been for nothing. Even if daca continues, am I supposed to just keep living in fear of it ending again forever? I'm losing all my fucking hair stressing over this. I've had a cold for months that hasn't gone away, and everything hurts.   I can't even talk to anyone about this. Everyone just tells me to man up and work some shitty job picking fruit in the fields. No one understands that I actually have goals in life. I refuse to accept a life where I work 60 hours a week, breaking down my body, for $30k a year with no room for advancement and living in fear every day. I've never been fond of life in the first place. The only thing that ever gave me happiness was growing my net worth, and pretty soon I won't even be able to do that. Why shouldn't I end it all at that point?  That's it. I needed to rant. I'm sorry if I sound like a spoiled brat.  TL:DR: I rely on daca to have an even somewhat decent life. It's being taken away.

Is it obvious when you have depression? I wonder if I have some form of mild depression or I just have low self esteem. I became a mute quite a few years ago after acouple of events that got me down. I think it may have been catatonia. But I'm not 100%. Ever since then I don't feel like I got back to my normal self. I'm a lot shyer and I don't have much luck socially or romantically or in my career. The best way to put it would be I lost my personality. I can really beat myself up sometimes because I hate myself. When something bad happens I really start self loathing quite badly. I don't feel suicidal. I hate myself more than I hate my life. I blame my lack of success on myself. I don't enjoy things as much as I used to so I have no real hobbies. I don't think I'm likable and I can't even pass interviews these days. I lost my personality and that's why I hate myself. I'm unrecognisable to who I used to be so I isolate myself a lot more these days. I don't think significantly depressed but I wonder if mild depression is the cause of my loss of personality? Or could it be something else that caused me to change?

" I am so very angry. It is eating me up. I am sick of it. It is not healthy. It costs me a lot. Yet even this makes me angry! rrARGGG! I feel like the female version of the Hulk.  Do you know how it feels to go through the cycles of feeling nuts / alone to gaining a semblance of normalcy? Well, that makes me angry. I get angry when I start to get happy. I get angry when I start to feel sad. I get angry when someone shows me love. I get angry when things go well. I get angry when things don't go well. I get angry, I get angry, I get angry.  This weekend I had this clear clear vision. I was immediately present for the first time in a long time. I felt, I breathed, I listened, I laughed. I saw. And I got very very angry.  I do not belong where I am. I do not belong. I screwed up, I fell asleep, I got depressed; and now Look at all that has changed! Nothing is the same; and I feel like I have traveled through a million miles of time in one short weekend.  This is all too much. Who the hell am I? How did I get here? What am I going to do now? Shit!!  All this time I believed I could do it alone. All this time I tried to be strong. All this time I tried to put others before myself; no matter what the cost. Now I am alone. I am like a ghost of myself. When I speak, what comes out is all wrong. I am nothing like I used to be. I am scared, I am torn, and I am alone.  My old friend looks to me: you're so great. You are here for me and you are strong. Blah blah blah ....... in reality we are just too lost souls traveling the highways alone. If I see you, I see you. But you aren't going be there for my funeral. You'll probably not even know when and where it is. You'll sleep through it and read about in the newspaper or some shit. You'll cry to the person next to you, and that will be that.  Family looks at me and says ""oh we love you so much. You are so strong and what? Are you going through creative or man pains again?"" Gee, I love you too. But you are not the answer. WE are just traveling the highways alone. You keep looking for the answer. I know there aren't no answer. We are alone: wine song and comforting arms and all.  I am angry because I know this journey is mine and I am not doing so hot. I get disorientated, I get distracted, I screw up. And you know what?! That's ok.  thanks; I needed a good angry rant :) Maybe there is someone out there who doesn't find this completely insane. If I don't speak it, it will stay inside and explode in some other form.

"I am 30 years old and I've been living with depression as long as I can remember (I think it started when I was 10) . However I was diagnosed with major depression only 2 years ago. Since then I've experienced recurrent episodes of depression. I thought that knowing what was my problem, accepting it, taking medication, seeing a therapist, working on cognitive therapy, would make my life better. Unfortunately, I still have those major episodes of depression where I'm hopeless and sad, and the only solution available to stop the pain seems to kill myself. No fun in there.  I know that depression is part of who I am, I know it's part of my life and I accept it. What I cannot accept is the fact that it's not going to be easier. I need hope.

"this is my first post , so bare with me. I have been married a year and just found out some interesting news about my husband. He told me that the man he calls dad is not really his father. He told me that his mother never told him until he was 13 years old, and had to go to court to change his name. I always wondered why, he and his father never got along. His mother won't tell him who his real father is. I feel I need to help him find him, so he can close the door, and get answers to all his questions. My husband does not like to talk about feelings, he was raised in a family where no one talked about feelings and if you had a problem you  kept it to yourself. I was raised totally opposite. In ways this has left him hurt and confused. He feels like he doesn't belong sometimes. He told me sometimes he would like to know who his dad is and other times he could care less. But, it seems like it is always on his mind, when family issues come about. The man that raised him, is an issue all to his own, he is very abusive, physically, and mentally. He is always telling my husband, he is wrong and will never be able to be successful.  He has heard that all his life, but he has never believed it - he is strong and has a good heart - It just hurts me when I see him lash out. He takes all his problems out on me, I now understand why.   I have not told him, but I found out who his father is. All I have is a name. I want to tell him but don't know if I should. I don't want his mother not to talk to him if he knows - I'm very confused - I'm right in the middle and don't want anyone to get hurt. Looking for advice - or someone that can relate to this.

"I've already posted on this forum but  I never really introduced myself.  So here goes:  My name is Amy, and I am 24 years old.  I have two beautiful daughters, ages 5 and 3.  I am also raising my little brother, who is 1.  I have suffered from anxiety attacks since I was 16 and became seriously depressed about 2 years ago.  I was hospitalized once ... when the doctor put me on Zoloft.  Since then I have tried Effexor XR and Klonopin (worked for 8 months) and am supposed to be trying Wellbutrin and Buspar now (scared to start them).  I self - harm when things get too hard for me, and have scars covering much of my left arm due to cutting.  I was recently dismissed from my therapy / psychiatrist due to missed appointments ... and I don't know if I am going to find another one yet.  I think about just letting go sometimes.  Nothing really helps anyways.  The one thing that depresses me the most is my fear of spending the rest of my life alone.  Men seem to think I am only good for one thing ... and I guess I agree.  I hate that I go from being okay ... sometimes for weeks at a time ... and then everything falls apart.  My family supports me ... sometimes.  At least, my mom lets me crash at her house when things are real bad.  My mom and my sister try to be there ... but they get tired of me.  I can't say I had a bad childhood ... I can't remember my childhood.  I went under hypnosis ... had a vision of my dad and became extremely afraid.  I never had a chance to go back and find out why.  Missed too many appointments.  My dad was accused of being abusive (to my mother) and having a violent temper ...  and of molesting my sister and I.  Don't remember.  My dad says my mom left us for two years when I was 2 or 3 years old and was always drunk.  Don't remember.  I spent much of my teen years drunk / high and being promiscuous ... let's just say even my mother knew I had a reputation.  Why?  Don't know.  I have never felt like I belonged ... and the past few years I have felt like I haven't really been living.  Disassociation, I suppose.  I am usually moody, never have any energy, and have started and quit school 3 times to date.  Never accomplished anything but getting my GED ... and the sad thing is ... I'm smart.   I live day to day ... never knowing if it will be a good day or a bad day.  My daughter had missed a lot of school because I can't seem to get her there by 12 in the afternoon.  My mom says she will help ... but I know I am on my own.  Neither of my daughters' father's are any help.  My dad left my little brother with me in November, sends down some money every month... and hasn't seen him since.  Some days I feel like I am on top of things ... most days I feel like things are on top of me ... and smothering me.  I've started writing my daughters a letter letting them know everything I want them to know when they are older ... just in case I'm not around.  I can't say for sure this won't beat me one day, and I want to be prepared.  I love my kids ... but also believe with all my heart they would be better off without me.  Sure ... they love me and I'm their mommy ... but not all mommies are good mommies and not all mommies deserve to raise children.  Love isn't always enough ... because God (is he even real?) knows I would die / kill for my girls.  I know the answers to nothing and have so many questions.  This is my life ...  Scared to be alone ... but I always am.  I read this somewhere and it sums up how I feel:  I'm not hungry ... but I'm starving.  I'm not tired ... but I'm exhausted.  I'm not bleeding ... but I'm dying.  So hi to everyone who is fighting the same fight ...  I just need to know that I am not alone.

"For the first time in my life i liked this girl and when she left life around me doesn't make sense. Why does this pain happen to people This is my first time and please i need some answers on what to do, why does life work this way, i fucking hate that things had to go wrong this fucking way. My depression is taking over me and my family is worried about me.  For the first time in high school i liked this girl for about 7 months and during that time we became best friends and i always thought she would like me if i cared for her and treated her right. i always acted the same way as her and found out we thought the same sometimes. We always talked to each other including late night till 2 or 3 am and we knew everything about each other and we always were with each other but instead she liked some asshole who didn't like me and always kept lying about me to her. She never believed what he said about me but chose to love him and be with him more and they always were with each other after class and it made me jealous and angry on why she would do this. One day i invited her to some place with her and my friends but she decided to also want to take the asshole and i got frustrated and ended our friendship. she got angry at me and decided to leave too. but one day the asshole decided to leave her because of a fight they had and she starts crying to me on the phone and i try to help her get over him but it hurts me when she says she loves this person who kept lying to her about me and other things and he was known to be a bad person and she only dated one guy before but he was super nice and i didn't understand why she liked him and she said she didn't either, it was only that she felt happy around him. She is such a pretty girl and most of the guys in the school agree and thought me and her were dating but they never knew she really liked this asshole and during the time they hanged out she kept asking me if they were right for each other and she said she would separate from him but she didn't listen to me. Instead they got closer and me and this asshole got into more fights with each other but she would rather not say anything and still be with him. Now she is actually separating from him after all this time. Why did she do this to me after everything we've been through because i treated her way better but she did this to me and i dont know should i go back to her after what she did. Its been 2 weeks and i haven't talked to her since then and my mind has been thinking of ways to beat myself up because of this problem. Everyone knows im depressed but at this point i couldn't care and im losing my mind and i just need some answers of why she liked this asshole but not me.",time life liked girl left life doe not make sense doe pain happen people time need answer do doe life work way fucking hate thing wrong fucking way depression taking family worried me time high school liked girl month time best friend thought like cared treated right acted way thought sometimes talked including late night till knew instead liked asshole did not like kept lying her believed said chose love class jealous angry this day invited place friend decided want asshole got frustrated ended friendship got angry decided leave too day asshole decided leave fight start cry phone try help hurt say love person kept lying thing known bad person dated guy super nice did not understand liked said did not either felt happy him pretty girl guy school agree thought dating knew really liked asshole time hanged kept asking right said separate did not listen me instead got closer asshole got fight not say him actually separating time did treated way better did dont know did week not talked mind thinking way beat problem know im depressed point not care im losing mind just need answer liked asshole not me,0.4313182234764099,0.431777685880661,0.4174162447452545

I have no idea why the rudness of some totally strange person, probably between 12-16, made me so... down.  I think it's because I use Reddit a lot as someway of just...

"My grandma is dying and life doesn't stop So I work full-time and go to grad school part-time. I'm busy 7 days a week between work, class, and homework/housework. Normally this is a very good thing for me as it keeps the depression and other mental illness at bay.  But my grandma's dying. She was put into hospice over the weekend and can't do much of anything anymore. I love her so much as my grandparents/mom's side of the family have been the only stable family I've ever had. My grandmother is an amazing woman. She graduated as valedictorian of her college class. She raised 7 amazing children (all college grads and successful in their fields) and has 14 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. She's 90 and has lived an amazing life.  It's still so hard to say goodbye. I've been doing my best to spend time with her and my visiting family but the grief and depression are kicking my ass. I can't do anything. I have a huge paper due this week and work has been insanely stressful. I can't even manage to get my laundry done and I'm buying and eating shit food that is bankrupting me.  I don't know what to do. Life won't stop, and I'm so stressed that my whole body is breaking out in rashes and I'm sore all the time.

"Hi, I am Ellen a.k.a. Froggie girl62, a 43-year-old female who has been depressed for life. I have been labeled as having dysthymia in the past. Although it was never officially shared with me, I believe from what I have read that I was depressed even as a child. I graduated college the first time in 1985 with a BA in Sociology with Medical Emphasis and have worked in the medical transcription field for 19 years. I have become bored with the job and dissatisfied with being forced to work from home. (Majorly boring!) Last year I started going back to school to pursue a Masters in Fine Arts in Graphic Design. This has been a huge challenge since I am brand new in the art field and most of the other students are already artists. In addition, I MUST work 40 hours a week to maintain my health insurance benefits. My mom has been my best friend and support person forever and now she has been diagnosed with lung cancer. She had surgery 2 months ago and just began chemotherapy last week. I have had an awful time dealing with this. Although she has been given a fairly decent prognosis, I am scared that she is going to leave me and would trade places with her in flash if I could. Truthfully I am disappointed every day when I wake up. I save lots of money on products to remove mascara, as the tears usually do the job. I had been on Zoloft 25 mg since the late 1990s and my family doctor increased it first to 50 and now to 100 mg. I have also started seeing a psychiatrist, only 2 sessions so far, so hard to say much about that. In the past when I went for counseling, they just gave me silly assignments and told me to go out and meet people. With my school work, I have enough assignments already. I found this forum from a post on another support forum.",hi ellen aka froggie girl yearold female depressed life labeled having dysthymia past officially shared me believe read depressed child graduated college time ba sociology medical emphasis worked medical transcription field year bored job dissatisfied forced work home majorly boring year started going school pursue master fine art graphic design huge challenge brand new art field student artist addition work hour week maintain health insurance benefit mom best friend support person forever diagnosed lung cancer surgery month ago just began chemotherapy week awful time dealing this given fairly decent prognosis scared going leave trade place flash could truthfully disappointed day wake up save lot money product remove mascara tear usually job zoloft mg late s family doctor increased mg started seeing psychiatrist session far hard say that past went counseling just gave silly assignment told meet people school work assignment already forum post support forum,0.42591139674186707,0.4623592495918274,0.4002162516117096
"'I promised I'd post regarding what I perceived to be a meltdown. As previously posted, I told all y'all that I'd been taking Neurontin. Since it wasn't prescribed for seizures but for sleep, insurance would no longer cover it because they said it didn't fit into the category of antidepressants or psychotropics, and so on and so forth. All red tape.  So, the Neurontin was stopped, through no fault of my own. Well, this disturbed my therapist. So, after almost 6 weeks off of the Neurontin, during which each week I seemed to be going more off the deep end. Meaning, I couldn't sleep, eat, had the shakes, horrific mood swings, unable to think positive about myself, and piggyback panic attacks and I subsequently was going off on some crying gig, etc.  So, on the 22nd when I saw my doctor she said with everything I was describing, that indeed I was having withdrawals. Like Duh, I already knew that. It seems the combination of the meds I was on was balancing me out and the mere change in the medicine did in fact change the way the other meds worked, or didn't work. Since I'm so hypersensitive to just about every medication, (it took forever to find the right medications and dosages to keep me on the straight and narrow) the doctor said she'd like for me to go back to the psychiatrist that originally prescribed the medications and see if they'd try another antidepressant. Another one? That didn't set well with me and I guess I was at the end of my rope. I broke down and ended up staying at the doctor's office for almost two hours while they had to give me a pill to calm me down. I felt so vulnerable and of course in my state of mind I perceived this as another crisis. I also felt extremely 'stupid' for breaking down that way. That is why I said I had a ""meltdown.""  There wasn't much I could physically do on Thursday, but, I knew I had to come back to earth. After calming down, thanks to their ""cocktail pill"", which I didn't ask its name. I agreed to see the psychiatrist. What choice did I have. I think the crying episode happened because I remembered all the bad events that happened while they were trying to find the right meds that would balance me out. It's scary. Of course while I was at the doctor's, I kept asking stupid questions like, ""why do I have to be on anything?""  Is that denial or what?  So, to cut this short. I'll be going to the psychiatrist as soon as they can fit me in.  But I need some help. I'm asking any of my friends here to give me any input you want. I've been doing pretty good the last couple of days doing the cognitive thinking and just staying busy. It's the down time that's unsettling. And obviously, if you see the time this is being posted, you know I'm not sleeping much. I am thinking positive. My doctor called me Friday to check on me. That was surprising. A doctor really calling back. So, seeing how she's my 'new' doctor, maybe we'll be compatible after all.  Thanks for taking the time to read this and for anything you'd like to add to help.  I really appreciate all of you and the joy I receive from reading and writing to you all means a lot to me. Your kindness means so much.

"I'm new to any kind of discussion like this.  I'm new to any kind of support like this.  I go to Therapy once a week, or rather I did, but it wasn't really making a large difference.  I'm going to be twentytwo soon, and my life is nowhere how I wish it to be.  The funny part is that to get it where I would like it all I'd have to do is go out and get a job, start working.  I just can't seem to leave the house.  I'm not a shut in, or anything.  I love people.  I try and keep friends with everything, but I get self - conscious  all the time.  My early life was pretty difficult when it came to that, getting bullied badly for wearing glasses and being a bit of a dork.  I never really learned those little social rules that everyone else did.  Sometimes I just feel like I'm not on everyone's page, and nothing seems to help.  I became a father at nineteen, and it was difficult.  I loved my girlfriend very much at the time, and dropped out of school to support her and our daughter.  I love my daughter, she's everything.  My girlfriend left me for another man when our daughter was four weeks old, I can't help but feel insecure about this.  Logically I should know she's just not so bright or genuine a person with me, but I can't help but feel part of it was me.  She stopped letting me see my daughter a short time after, I had to go to court and battle things out.  The only accomplishment I've made in the last year that I could feel proud about was to get partial custody and three days a week with her.  I'm attentive and loving father.  I have a great relationship with my little girl.  But I can't feel good about it.  Sometimes it's like, as soon as she's gone, I forget she was even here.  I spend all day in the house, like a zombie.  I'm either on the computer or at the TV, watching baseball.  I know I want to have a healthy and happy life, and I want to have money and security for my daughter, but I can't motivate myself to do anything.  My parents were never attentive, and fight constantly, but I'm twentyone and should be over that.  Instead, it makes me more down now than it ever has.  I'm like a giant pit of negativity all the time.  I was involved with a girl, but that faded quick, and just like everything else it brought me down.  I don't do drugs, or drink, but sometimes I really want to.  Funny part is that I've never felt any kind of relief doing them in the past.  In fact, usually my insecurities and negativity are worse.  I feel like I need to get moving soon, or I'll never get moving.  I tried killing myself after my girlfriend stopped letting me see my daughter, I know how bad that was for me.  I know how I made others feel, and I know how miserable I was.  I don't ever want to get that way again.  But for some reason, and I just don't understand, I can't get myself to get moving.

My parents only having expectations for me to succeed just makes me feel like the biggest failure of my brothers. Which not only is bullshit but also makes me just not try in the first place a lot of the time. Because if I try and fail its worse because I’m expected to succeed.  I don’t even understand why they expect me to be the successful one. I barely got acceptable grades in high school until senior year when I just took easy courses. I failed English and nearly failed Spanish in 9th grade because I was too lazy to put in any effort. I barely ever brought home friends or did extracurricular activities most of high school.

"Do you ever feel like you can't do anything right and everyone secretly hates you? I've felt like that for as long as I can remember, and it feels like no matter how many times people tell me it's not true, I can't convince myself that I'm not a worthless waste of human existence and that everyone doesn't see me for the shitty person that I am.

"I tried to get onto the chat room, but it won't let me so I'll just post my question here. In my sociology class today my professor was talking about an experiment where several pseudomanic (healthy) patients checked into mental hospitals to record the results. The details of the experiment aren't important, but what I was wondering was about how my teacher said that the patients used fake names so that it would not be on their permanent record and so that they wouldn't be labeled as ""crazy"". So I raised my hand and asked who would be labeling them and why they couldn't use their real names, like how would people know? He said that it would be on their record and that if people wanted to find out if they have ever been hospitalized they could, particularly employers. Kind of like if you wanted to inquire about a rapist living in your town, is what he said. I wanted to ask more but didn't want to press it. So my questions are, what kind of record does this go on? Your hospital record? Your police record? When employers do a background check, does this show up? Then I was wondering, when police pull you over for speeding or something and they check your information on their computer, what comes up? Everything? If they were involved in an ambulance taking someone into the hospital, do they have that on file? Is there any way to see what's on your file? I'm just a little paranoid now about if there are going to be limitations in life now as to what I can do because of my record.  Or if anyone knows how I would be able to find out this information that would be great, ",tried chat room not let just post question here sociology class today professor talking experiment pseudomanic healthy patient checked mental hospital record result detail experiment not important wondering teacher said patient used fake name not permanent record not labeled crazy raised hand asked labeling not use real name like people know said record people wanted hospitalized could particularly employer kind like wanted inquire rapist living town said wanted ask did not want press it question are kind record doe on hospital record police record employer background check doe up wondering police pull speeding check information computer come up everything involved ambulance taking hospital file way file just little paranoid going limitation life record know able information great,0.36931294202804565,0.5377126932144165,0.3530101776123047

"Really struggling with self image - any tips to build self confidence? I have struggled with my overall view of myself for as long as I can remember - in particular with my weight. Where im at, at the moment feels like the worst its ever been, I keep having full blown melt downs about how much I repulse myself. Throughout my life Ive been on more diets than I can count and tried multiple different excercise routines. About 4 years ago I gained 30kgs really fast and after moping and feeling sorry for myself i decided i would kick it up a notch and started taking things really serious. 6 days a week at the gym, personal training, strict meal plans - the works. This worked so well at the beginning, I dropped 18kgs in the first few months. It came to a halt and for the past 3 years I've continued to lose weight slower - im at about 25 kilos down in total now. I thought I would be further along by now.   I live and work on the road at the moment travelling from town to town so ive dropped the gym membership but I try and make up for it with doing workout sessions on my own, lots of hiking and swimming. I recently switched to a keto diet from the previous meal plan I was on. I am fitter than I have ever been and what I can achieve now in a physical capacity is so much greater than ever before in my life (I was less fit even as a child)  The problem I have is that im still so overweight, I very rarely find anything that fits me in stores and i dont have an address to order things online. I feel like people could look at me and assume I dont give a fuck about my health when I do and that makes me feel worse. Anytime I talk to doctors about unrelated issues they make it about my weight. I feel like outwardly im the worst version of myself, I look in the mirror and get angry. Does anyone have any tips on how to pull myself out of this? I feel so crushed when I'm reminded of my weight because I dont feel how I look. I want to be proud of my achievements but I'm not, I feel annoyed that its not better and I havent reached a bigger goal. I think ill never reach a weight I'm happy with - which is not only devastating to me but bothers me so much more because im genuinely trying my hardest. Ive had hiccups and times where I've literally tried to eat my feelings away but I always pick myself up and try again. I dont know how many more times I can fail.   In an effort to help me stay on track my partner started eating the same foods as me. Weightloss had never been his goal or something he was focusing on, it was just to make it easier on me not to see him eating a toasted cheese sandwich while I was eating salad with no dressing. He wanted to limit the temptation and helped cook me awesome healthy meals that tasted a million times better than anything I cooked. For him it worked a treat, he was never overweight just a bit stocky, but hes since lost so much weight and looks amazing. And whilst im so happy for him it hurts as it just shows how much progress i havent made. As stupid as it sounds I think it highlights my weight more when we're together cause he looks so fit and healthy and I look like I sit around eating kfc all day. I want to be confident or at least more confident but I'm so critical on myself I cant even begin to let the confidence through.

"I don't know what my problem is Hello, I've never posted here before. I'm a 28 year old guy and have a decent job that I like, it's quiet and involves a lot of puzzle solving and I'm pretty good at it. I've never had a ton of friends because I'm very particular and not very open with people so it takes a long time to build up relationships, but the friends I do have are outstanding and I wouldn't trade them for anything. I'm kind of the funny guy but my humor is very blue. I got bullied a lot in grade school and learned to make people laugh because it'd get them to not make fun of me. I think it just kind of stuck. I don't know if any of that information is really important, just wanted to give it in case that's something that people do here.    For at least 5 years, I have a hard time doing anything outside of my job alone without crawling up inside my head. All the things that I used to do for enjoyment like listening to music or playing video games, I just can't do anything anymore. It's like a wave of apathy that very rarely lifts. Occasionally, I pick up a razor blade and will press it into my shoulder or hand and I don't really know why to be honest. I don't know if I like the pain or maybe I like having something else to focus on for a minute. Or just to feel something that isn't apathy for a moment.     I think about dying sometimes. Why we're here, what's the point if it ends the same. I doubt I'd ever kill myself because there are things I care about here that I wouldn't leave behind like that, mainly my mom and brother. I worry my brother will end up like me.     Is there anything I can do? I don't know what a pill could do for me or if a pill works. I think the brain is so complex that it couldn't, but I guess I don't know. I don't want to be in a mental fog or be unaware or not be me anymore. I've also always kind of thought that it's human nature to feel this way: that everybody gets down, gets bored, thinks about their mortality, etc. and that I'm just being soft and need to suck it up. Life is difficult, I just need to learn to deal with it maybe.     I don't know what's going on but I don't like feeling like that. If I'm hanging out with friends or family I'm usually fine, it's being alone with myself and having time alone where I can't entertain myself and waste away. I can't really explain it. Does anyone else feel like this? What helps you? I've never talked to a therapist or anything like that and understand you cannot give a diagnosis on here, but if you know any methods to help me get out of that feeling, I'd be eternally grateful.

"I want to die [trigger warning] [Trigger Warning]     My trauma happened when i was 8, I'm now 18 and still suffer from it daily. I actually suppressed the trauma completely until I was 12, when it all came back to me; so I guess I've only really been dealing with it for 6 years now.    I have severe PTSD, severe depression, anxiety, severe panic/anxiety attacks, OCD, severe memory loss, and had an intense eating disorder for 6 years that I'm still struggling with constantly. I haven't gotten a good nights' sleep in years. I have constant PTSD nightmares, regular nightmares, and insomnia/constant fatigue and exhaustion. I also disassociate a lot and self harmed for years. Currently clean from self harm for about a year and a half. I've been admitted to a hospital because of all of my mental problems, and honestly wish I could go back sometimes. I was gaslighted for years to believe that my trauma was normal. My home environment was constantly hostile.     I go through long periods of feeling suicidal. Currently in that period. Don't know what to do, honestly. Years of being in therapy and being prescribed pills and yet I still am nowhere near being close to healthy. Looking back, I can't even remember the last time I was genuinely happy. The periods of my sadness last longer than my periods of calm. I'm so afraid of waking up when I'm 40 and still feeling the same way I do now.     The thing about being an adult that spent their entire teenage years thinking they would have killed themselves by now is realizing that your mental illnesses have real repercussions. I have fucked bones and a fucked stomach because of an eating disorder that lasted so long and a GED because I couldnt find the will to do schoolwork when I was just trying to find the will to live another day and not cut myself again. I can’t afford college because I didn’t do any extracurriculars to get scholarships because the thought of having to stay after school made me want to have a panic attack and i just wanted to sleep. I have no friends because when people invited me to hang out my anxiety made me cry myself to sleep instead. I didn’t have any real thought-out “grand plans” because I was too busy hurting myself and getting high and wanting to kill myself to really sit down and plan things out. I said I wanted to do things but never took the time to think it all through.     It doesnt seem fair that I went through this trauma, had/have all of this mental illness, and now have to do with the repercussions of those illnesses. It doesnt seem fair that I'm suffering so much still. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of trying so fucking hard. I know this is self-pitying and 'emo' but I just don't know what to do.

"Escapism and depression Sorry about the self-pity rant that's inbound, needed to get this out there somehow.  This morning I was taking a shower sitting down with the lights off - I know, pretty edgy behavior, but it's my way of unwinding and resetting myself between bouts of work.   I finished up a relatively escapist story the night prior. Stupidly, I had allowed myself to suspend my disbelief and got sucked into the plot. The writing wasn't even terribly good - the only reason I enjoyed myself was because I could temporarily forget my current self and take up the role of some other more relevant and admirable character.   The story ended with a shoehorned but unbearably happy ending where the main character gets married, settles in with his newfound friends, and all's good for the time being. You know, the typical ""insert generic ending here"" bullshit.   Fast forward to this morning. I'm in the shower and start thinking of my day to come, making mental to-do lists, and stressing about my current temporary problems. But somewhere along the line, I start thinking of the stupid story. I can't help but start comparing my  life with that of the main character and think about how much I'd give just to be able to live a more meaningful, less real life. Then I start comparing myself to the character, and realize just how _useless_ I am. Like holy shit, I'm almost an adult and am still a passionless idiot who does nothing outside of schoolwork. Of course I can't lead a meaningful life, I'm not worthy of any of it. Thinking about this evidently stressed me out a bit too much, as I started puking what little I ate all over my shower floor and crying.   I don't know. I enjoy escapism probably to a fault, but it's the only way for me to feel at least a little relevant. I'll probably come to terms with my role as human being #6,732,385,402 someday.

"It's been so long since I've been here doubt anyone would remember me!  Lots has been happening.  My job has become busier so I've become more exhausted when I get home and I just don't want to do anything.  Then on March 4 my brother from my adopted mother died of a heart attack so had to go through that experience with my niece, his only daughter.  Then right after that my husband got really sick with pain in his belly.  We took him into emergency and they did a CT scan and could see only massive infection and couldn't tell where it was coming from.  So he was admitted and given antibiotics and scheduled for a colonoscopy.    He was also very low on potassium so he was given bags of potassium and taking pills on top of that.  His colon was clear so it was determined his gall bladder was diseased and needed to come out.  But right now it was so swollen and infected the surgeon wanted to wait until the infection cleared and swelling went down before he took it out.  So husband is now on a non-fat diet to reduce the swelling and still on antibiotics to clear out the infection.  Fortunately, being vegan, non - fat is not too hard for us to do.  He goes in for a pre - exam on Wednesday and then surgery a week later.  But through all this I haven't been doing my routing of medications and exercise and am suffering for it.  Fibro and migraines have hit me really hard.  I'm still trying to take care of my husband though by preparing his meals.  He lost almost 30 lbs through the last week of this whole episode.  In the meantime, I have an appointment Monday with a neurosurgeon to discuss if something needs to be done with my tethered spinal cord.  I've had it for years and it causes weakness in my legs and pins and needles in my feet.  It could also affect bladder and bowel functions but I haven't had that problem yet.   I've read that sometimes they cut the end of the spinal cord to get it out of the way of the vertebrae.  I'm not sure how serious my case is but my neurologist thought it was serious enough to send me to surgeons.  It's a rare birth defect I guess found in adults.  Usually they catch it in infants.

"Today I realized I don't have any friends. Not really. This weekend I was going to go to a Harry Potter symphony with my two aunts. One of them and my grandma, who all live together, got sick. They gave me the three tickets. They told me to go with friends,  but they don't want to chance getting me sick or no one staying with their mom.   Fair enough. As I was driving home from work today I was thinking about who to take, and I came up blank. No one came to mind. I have my roommates, but I don't really talk to them much and they all have girlfriends that they hang out with all the time anyway. Even the ones I went to high school with. I realized the other day when they mentioned it in passing that they had started a new DnD campaign with a new guy. I'm never invited to dinners or anything anymore. We never make a big ass meal together on Saturday anymore. Honestly, I don't think they'd even want to go anyway.   There's no one else I'd ask. Everyone at work is either dating someone or I don't know them well enough. I'm taking online classes so no one there either. I don't do anything outside of school or work.

"I’ve been depressed all my life and I’m just tired I️’m finding it harder and harder everyday. I’m almost 23 years old and I️ can’t even function properly. I️ feel like I️ have the mental capacity of a child sometimes because I️ don’t know how to do anything. My entire life I️ lived in fear of my parents and now that I’m out I️ just can’t function at all. I️ had to quit my job because I️ couldn’t handle being at work in my emotional state. I️ can’t handle people being vaguely negative towards me. I feel awful because now it’s just my fiancé working, but he says that it’s okay that I️ need time.. I can’t help but feel he resents me for it. I don’t even know how we’re going to pay for our wedding. I️ don’t know anything about feminine hygiene, or how to brush/style my hair. It’s just matted in knots and up in a bun, or if it looks decent enough I’ll put it in a ponytail. I️ don’t know how to keep friends because I️ was constantly grounded for everything. I️ spent most of my life alone in my room, when I️ was grounded I️ wasn’t allowed to eat dinner with the family. I️ have 2 step sisters, one half sister, and 3 half brothers. All from 3 different marriages not including my parents’ since I’m their only child. And I’m not close with any of them. I️ don’t even know all of their ages. I️ didn’t have mother figure in my life because my stepmoms were just either physically abusive or emotionally. My dad was a drunk, and just controlled every aspect of my life yelling at me if I️ didn’t want to do something or had different opinions than him “you think you’re in control of your life but you’re not. You belong to me” or make weird sexual remarks in front of his friend when I️ would have a friend over “oh you two girls are probably going to kiss and rollover on top of each other” thankfully not in front of her. But sadly our friendship didn’t really last very long. Then he convinced me to get really drunk when I️ went to go visit from college and his friend tried taking advantage of me when I️ was trying to sleep it off in my room. I️ want to get a better job than the one I️ had previously but my upkeep is awful and I️ probably wouldn’t get hired.. And I️ know I️ have to better myself but it’s just so hard I️ just don’t know where to start. I️ have no money. No friends. I️ practically have no family because I️ never want to go back. I️ dropped out of school because I️ couldn’t afford it anymore because my dad stole the money I️ saved up. But even if he didn’t I️ probably still would’ve dropped out because I️ couldn’t pick a major, I️ kept changing it, and I️ feel like a loser because I️ was supposed to graduate this year. I️ used to be really good at math and writing and now I️ can’t even remember simple math or how to use proper grammar. I️ find myself not knowing how to spell words or using the wrong ones and it just makes me feel so stupid. I️ hate it. I️ was diagnosed with BPD and I️ can’t even afford to treat it. My car stopped working, and I️ don’t even know how to use a bus. I️ hate my life. I️ hate everything. I’m just so tired of it all. I️ already went to a mental facility for a month and I️ still can’t function. I️ can’t bring myself to end it all because I️ love my fiancé more than anything. He’s been my one true friend since high school, even if we only spoke at school, he’s always been there for me. I️ can’t leave him. I️ don’t know what to do. I don’t have clear thinking. I️ hate that I’m so black and white, I’m just trying to be gray.

"The last 3 days felt like the first days of my life. Today feels like the beginning of the last days. I have been having depression since Senior Year. I have been fighting non stop for 5 years. I took gap years to fight depression. Until last October, I thought depression has gone cause i felt totally normal at that time. During the time, I had a lot of ups and downs. Lots of tears, lots of laugh. But i have never given up on myself  Last November, my brother did sth bad. And my ex attempted suicide. That is when i got depressed again. The first time in 2 years   Until 3 days ago, I met a girl. ""Perfect stranger"" is the word that would suit her the most. My situation with her is exactly like in the movie ""Before we go"" by Chris Evan. 2 strangers meet each other out of 7 billion people but they would never see each other again. And 3 days after we met ( we hung out everyday for the last 3 days), she is gone. We still keep contact but I dont think i would ever see her again ( please dont ask why). She knows about depression. She made me make a promise to reach out to her every time i get depressed.  The last 3 days were the happiest days of my life. It feels like I actually live for the first time. But i also got depressed since. I got depressed because i couldn't recall her image. I couldnt recall her face. I couldn't recall what she looked like when we first met. And i couldnt remember why those were the happiest days of my life. I just recall those were the happiest. All i can recall is a brief moment of her smile for like 5-10 secs, her voice, and the moment when we were about to say good bye that i poured out my heart. Everything is so blurry.    Then i went on to google to search for blurry memories and depression. And it leads me to ""depression and memory loss"" and "" depression and Alzheimer "" . Then i started to shed tears. I was thinking about the day i actually lost my memories. What if it actually comes, What if one day i wouldnt remember her, my mom, my best friends, and even myself ? I was teaching in class when i shed tears. I had to run to the bathroom and cried in there for 15 mins. Luckily noone noticed.  I remembered my promise to her. I was about to text her. And then i started to cry again. I will bother her. I will make her worried. I will waste her time. And i cant afford to hurt people i love.  This is the beginning of the end.

"Am I Depressed or is it something else? This seems like a dumb question because to an extent I know I'm depressed but not to a clinical level. Like I hate the situation I'm in. I hate being in debt. I hate living where I live. That sort of thing.   However, I'm not unmotivated. Like at all. I'm not hopeless. I'm not suicidal in any way. I'm terrified of death in fact one of my biggest fears is that I'll get so depressed that I'll become suicidal which is weird, I know but the point is, nothing in me wants to die.   That being said, I'm tired all the time. I mean physically exhausted. Which seems to contradict major depression. I get up every day, shower every day, though I don't really want to go to work I go to work and do work with no issue (it's more that I don't enjoy my job that much on most days honestly some days it's super fun it's just one of those things it really has to do with the fact that I'm older and I'm not doing what I thought I'd be doing by this point in my life more than I hate my job).   I can't think of many reasons why I'd be this physically exhausted all the time. Literally every doctor says ""You you are just massively depressed"". No, I don't believe I'm depressed to the degree that it makes me physically exhausted. If I still have plenty of hope for the future, want to get up, want to get dressed, want to shower, want to look good...how is this major depression to a point where I'm also tired all the time? Is it possible to have some major depressive disorder and not be hopeless and still be motivated to work hard and try new things? Because if it is, someone needs to tell me that. Any time a doctor tells me I must be depressed if I'm so tired all the time and I tell them that I'm not hopeless or suicidal or unmotivated then they go, ""Oh well I don't know what it is then"".   I'm very annoyed with this because I never used to be physically exhausted like this before and doctors seem to just dismiss it as depression when I'm positive my depression isn't so bad it's ONLY making my physically exhausted and not having any other emotional affect on me. I'm frustrated so, if anyone can answer this it'd be helpful so I can see what avenue to pursue next.   Note: It's not a problem with my thyroid or adrenal gland I already had those checked twice by two different doctors.

"Back pain has brought me to a dark space. I’ve been struggling with back pain for 2 years now and I’m 17.   I play soccer (football), and thats all I know, I’ve played my whole life. I don’t have much friends nor other hobbies besides gaming (very mediocre gamer). However, these pass two years have been terrible. Due to my undying love for the sport, I would try to play through the pain. (regret it) Which has only made me worse. I decided my first Summer with back pain that I would not play for a month. Which I achieved with no real results. I passed the time playing Video games. However, the constant sitting probably made my back worse. I played a tournament that same Summer after the month break. 5 games some sort of international tournament. By the end of the tournament my back had gotten so bad I couldn’t bear to move. Despite all this, I somehow got chosen to go to Spain. Few months later I went to Spain at 16, with back pain, played soccer and such but didn’t get noticed. Fast forward to now and I’ve gone a whole season barley playing and still struggle with back pain. Now I’m 17, I’ve gone this whole Summer without much activity just stretching and ab work outs.   The Summer is almost over and the realization that I haven’t gotten better is  bringing a dark cloud over me. I scream at night out of anger and sadness. I constantly tell myself I want to die(&lt;-Im not sure if this is breaking a rule, sorry in advanced, just tell me and I’ll remove this part), and I cry everyday.   I do most of those things in private, when no one’s home (excluding the random screaming I do at night).  I don’t want my mom to worry about me like she does my diagnosed depressed big brother, and also her dealing with my little brother’s life (He’s 7). On top of all that my mom is a single mom and barley has time for her own life and gets sad easily. (The sight of my mom sad deeply pains me inside) I’ve always been the one kid that could take care of himself. She has even told me personally that she is glad that she doesn’t need to worry too much about me (only deals with my back pain, she takes me to rehab).   I’ve been to the Doctors and have done a MRI, they say its nothing. Just functional.  (Whatever that means...)   Point is, I’m very sad and I feel like I’m getting worse everyday. I don’t know what to do with my life. The one thing I was good at is now gone. I don’t have any other talents or interest.I feel empty without soccer and I don’t know how to feel it.  TL; DR: I’ve played soccer my whole life, got a back injury two years ago and I still haven’t healed. Doctors say its nothing) As a result, I am very sad but I keep it to myself. I’m not good at anything else.

"ok, so today i had another freak out. I woke up feeling good ... it was supposed to be my first therapy session (which i and my boyfriend were happy about) and then after this i was supposed to meet up with my boyfriend for lunch, check my test marks, and then go to the library with my boyfriend to study. These plans changed...  When i walked into the therapy office, they said no appointment was scheduled. All of a sudden i felt really rejected, not worthy of an appointment (like they gave it to someone else), anxious, sick to my stomach, a little dizzy. I've been waiting since February for this appointment! I couldn't deal with my anger properly or the fact that my plans for therapy were ruined today. I started stuttering kind of i kind of got all dazed out and really sick when the receptionist wanted to schedule another appointment. So, it's tomorrow at 9am ... 9am!!! What bastards.  Anyway, so because i got all weird ... i didn't want to be around people. I called my boyfriend ... couldn't get a hold of him. I cancelled .... didn't check my marks, didn't go to the library, or lunch or see my boyfriend. I left. I told my boyfriend i had bad anxiety.  So, now he wants a ""break.""  And I've been in my room since i got home (since about 1pm) .... feeling really low and weird and lightheaded ....  I've been rocking a lot too on my rocking chair ... it's a weird compulsive soothing mechanism i have. Don't ask.  I'm mad at my boyfriend because he decided to take a break when i needed him most. Is this cold or what?! At the same time i understand: he wants his ""brain clear"" for exam studying.  Whatever. I guess it's hard being with a depressed, neurotic girl.

"This is how I feel and I have a slight sense I am the only one to think think this way. I am depressed? Help wanted I yearn for the days I was in high school. I felt as if I was always happy and never worried about anything. I am 22, just having graduated from University. It seems each day I am becoming a person who does not want to have a relationship with anyone other then my family. I want to be alone. Happiness to me is being sheltered by reality--alone with my thoughts. I deleted every single bit of social media I had about a year ago (SC, FB, Insta, Twitter, etc) in an attempt to become as alone as possible.  I truly deep down wish I was never born, but I would never ever commit suicide. I wish more then anything else that I can just disappear and leave this world.  I am studying for the MCAT currently. I don't have any problem doing so because of my extremely addictive personality, but I find that I enjoy things that take my mind off of reality. Studying, reading, listening to music or going for a drives are my favorite ways to achieve this. But the reality I see is that this world is shit. I believe that as a whole, humans are riddled with greed and selfishness that are the motivations behind MOST of everything in this world. And by humans, that obviously includes myself and I hate myself down to the core for the selfish things I have done.  Maybe I am too cynical or something. But this bad world syndrome fucks my brain and idk. I REEEEALLLLY question every aspect of life and I can't help it. Each time I am left with questions that completely make me hate the way this world is. I guess I can give one example. The most recent self-philosophical argument I had is the idea of wars, with murdering others specifically. We praise those who fight for our country, yet at the same time a great deal of these same people are super religious. Do people not evaluate the reality they are in? Do they not question why they believe the things they do? Am I the only one? Does someone's act of ending another life provide justification for doing the same? Who is to even say so? If they would kill all of us if we did not kill them, then what makes our lives worth more?   That's just one example, but then I look at areas like American healthcare or the fact my family and others are wealthy while there are people fucking dying because they cannot get water or food. Even the American political system with the deep state and shit. Why are we even on this damn earth? Seriously, what is the point of everything in life? I simply don't view the joys of life being worth living for.  I just don't understand. This whole text here is just me rambling my thoughts in hopes that someone somewhere reading this could maybe help me.

"As you live life and learn new things you grow more mature. Life is not about growing up and making plans for tomorrow, it's about enjoying every moment as you're living. Happiness is the most important thing and people have forgotten that. The world is full of so many interesting things that all cost money and we believe having a lot of something is the key to happiness. And since money is the thing that buys us the things we want we sort of become obsessed with getting as much of it as we can. In my mom and my situation we've tasted what money can buy us and we don't want to go back to the way things used to be. But the thing is we were both happy then and now we're not. I've learned money cannot buy happiness. My dad and Julie don't have much money and they are happy. There is something we can all say we regret from our lives. I regret regretting. Everyday I've lived has come to this moment and even after all the things that have gone wrong recently, I can pretty much say I'm happy with they way my life has turned out. I'm happy with who I am behind my mask. I am happy with what I know and what I want to know. Lately I've been wanting to die. Actually no, I wanted to want to die. Depression is all about seeing those bad moments and ignoring the good times in your life. When you're depressed the only thing that matters are the bad times. I don't think I was stupid for wanting to want to die. When something goes wrong you tend to act out of spite as soon as it happens because you are so overwhelmed with the moment. Most people do this - it doesn't mean we're stupid it just means we got carried away and we sometimes do things without thinking. Now I'm starting to realize that the break up with Scott was a good thing. We were forcing something that wasn't making either of us happy. Of course I didn't think about either him or me and our happiness I just wanted to keep us together for as long as possible. Besides I have too many other things going on in my life right now that I need to work on and if we were still together I would have ignored these things. I don't want to become one of those people who throw their entire lives in their online journal so I won't go into everything that is going on with me. If you're my friend you know. I'm through acting like someone else in order to please people. This is my life and I'm the one living it. Other people won't be around my whole life but I will so therefore I'm putting myself and my happiness first. No more staying in one place because I'm afraid of change. I want to experience as much as I can because to me that is what life is all about. No more dwelling on the past it can't be changed - move onto today that's were things are happening and decisions need to be made. I don't want to slip off the road by looking the wrong way like I did on my driving test which by the way I failed. But that's ok, there's always next Thursday. OK enough with the things I've already learned and experienced. Onto new things, new places, and new people. I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself and wanting to be someone else. I'm going to be me again and do what makes me happy. I'm going to take advantage of the help I'm getting and I'm going to help myself get better and not depend on others to save me. And I'm also sorry to Scott, one of the reasons why I was so dependent on you was because you helped me and I thought you could save me entirely and make all the bad things go away. I now realize I'm the only one who can do that. I'm sorry I turned you into my therapist.

"Just wondering, for those who have had lifelong depression did you ever find some joy that wasn’t turned to a sad story? I’m starting to feel that depression never goes away, you just learn to manage it. I however, can’t recall a time in my life where I was happy. I don’t even congratulate myself when I do accomplish something. I don’t allow others to either, because it doesn’t mean much to get praised for things I should’ve accomplished a long time ago.

"I have been recently released from the hospital after a failed suicide attempt.  I am trying to learn how to cope with things and I recently found out that my wife has disclosed the fact that I attempted suicide to many people (about 8) that I really do not know, nor do I feel comfortable with them knowing.  As a matter of fact, I'm very upset about this.  For a little background my wife and i have not had the best relationship for the past 2 - 3 years.  about 18 months ago we moved back to her hometown after I lost my job and she could advance in her career where we are now.  I really don't have any friends down here and have lost contact with my old friends.  I have told 3 people that I attempted suicide (mom, dad, brother) and i knew that her family knew (mom, dad, 2 sisters)  Now my wife tells me that she needed to deal with what I have done and she has told many of her coworkers.  She couldn't talk about this with her family or with her high school friends (which are still in the area, and I have known about 8 years).  She had to tell people that she knows I don't know very well, and of what I do know, I don't like very much.  Now my wife wants me to do more things with her coworkers and I feel very uncomfortable around them.  Am I being too sensitive about this?  Not realizing my wife's needs?  Or am I justified in my being upset?  I will not be able to come back to this board until Monday (tomorrow) evening so I can't post any replies until then.

"Is it stress, depression or burn out? Hey,  I’m a diabetic 1 with Autism. For the past 3 years i have felt constant fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems, bad memory and concentration issues.  I took antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg before this during 8 months for major stress and it helped me with almost no side effects.  But after i quit antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg ,the fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems and concentration issues has been persistent in my life. Now for 3 years.  No matter how much rest i get i feel tired. Even if excercise, eat healthy, do yoga and meditation.  My blood sugar levels has been up and down lately. But even if they are controlled i feel the same.   A cause could be that i have worked on a lot of projects during the past 3 years.   It went as far as that i started to get suicide thoughts. I do not feel any ups or downs in my life. Things i used to like to do isles enjoyable. I rather stay at home than being social.  I believe i have major depression and i have visited psychologist and psychiatrist who have advised me to take antidepressants.  But the question is if I’m stressed, have major depression or simply burnt out.  I certainly feel that i have a huge major depression. My OCD thought are back and i have been stuck on testing my blood sugar 10-15 times per day during the past year. Which also could bring my stress levels up. The past year has been very stressful for me work wise. But even if i get a weekend of rest i don’t feel rested. I have been to different psychiatrists and psychologist and the conclusion is either major depression or burn out.  I barely have the energy to clean my apartment anymore, wash my clothes or think about my hygiene. I feel tearful occasionally on some days.   I have thought about taking antidepressants again, particularly Cymbalta since it worked for me the first time. But i have been afraid of taking them.   Instead my psychiatrist described me brintellix (Vortioxetine), 10 mg per day for my depression.  But the question is, i’m i stressed, depressed or burnt out? Anyone have been in a similar case?   Any experiences of the antidepressants brintellix (Vortioxetine) for major depression? I’m so afraid of starting to take them, but i don’t want to feel this way of every morning waking up with no motivation for anything that the day brings me.

I was diagnosed with Dysthymic Disorder and have been on and off a couple different kinds of medicines, one of which was Effexor and the other one I can't remember the name but it started with and S. I have a bad habit of remembering every bad thing that has ever happened to me and continually go over and over it in my head. I will bring up something with my brother or sister and they say ""I can't believe you remember that"" and yet sometimes I am lucky I remember my own name. I just started a new job recently and will not have insurance until the end of January. I am seriously considering going back to a therapist and possibly getting on medicines again.

"NOTES FOR A SUCCESSFUL EFFEXOR WITHDRAWAL  After doing research on this board and others, I prepared the following withdrawal regime and carried it out, making slight adjustments as I went along.  It worked for me, although the withdrawal was not easy.  I share it with you all in gratitude for all your advice and sharing over these past months. I hope it will be a help for you preparing to come off Effexor  1. MY SITUATION:  a. Length of Time of Effexor: 5.5 years  b. Dosage: 150 mg XR  c. Reason for Effexor: TMJ, myofascia and migraines due to a displaced jaw disc, lock jaw and stress.  d. Other medications: Flexeril (periodically over the years but not in past year when things are ""bad""); Trazodone, for sleep; vitamins and herbs as needed.  e. Status: Age: 43, Height 5'-10""; Weight: 160. Married, no kids, work from home.  f. Reasons to Come Off: Generally feeling better with the help of physiotherapist; life situation has become low-stress and stabile (secure job, good marriage, work from home); side effects of Effexor becoming irritating, especially the emotional distance from my own thoughts / emotions; and simply feel that I cannot be on this drug for the rest of my life.  2. MY WITHDRAWAL REGIME  Procedure:  Drop my dosage by 18.75 mg (XR) every two weeks. 4 months total time to get to zero. Divided 37mg pills into two parts to equal 18.75, depositing each part in new empty vegetable gel caps (available at health food store).  In general:  a. No caffeine -- not even decaffeinated coffee.  b. No alcohol.  c. Exercise every day (heartbeat up for 20 minutes or more).  d. Steam Room / Sauna / Hot bath or long hot shower every day.  e. 40-50 hour work weeks, nights / weekends off for ""down time"".  Daily:  a. Vitamins (one dosage each in the morning and night): B Complex (50 mg); C (1000  mg); E (400 iu); Omega (2000 mg); Glucosamine Sulfate; 8 glasses of water.  b. Continued with my Trazodone medication for sleep during entire tapering process, took no Flexeril.  Experience during each tapering of 18.75 mg:  First 24 hours: no side effects.  48 hours: very bad day: grumpy, anger, rage (for someone relatively sweet natured); nausea, dizzy, balance problems, headache; when moving head too quickly would become nauseous; body pains, disrupted sleep with periodic nightmares. The main thing is to be as far from other people as possible since any conversation would rub me the wrong way. Asked wife to take nothing I say personally, agree with whatever I say, or simply ""get out of my way"". Eventually we found sending her away for the day shopping or whatever to be the best. On these days I would plan to do a lot of non - thinking busy work around the house: fix things, garden, etc. Spent extra time at gym and in steam room.  72 hours: very low energy, dopey, foggy, wanting to stay in bed, body pains. My energy would then slowly gain over the next few days. Some of the above side effects would appear briefly without warning between drops in dosage (anger, bad nights sleep, sluggish).  Once at zero mg.:  Symptoms:  All of the above, but slightly increased in all areas.  Acute allergy symptoms -- sneezing, headache, stuffed up from morning to night -- aches and pains. I took Benadryl during this time which helped a lot.  Detox Period:  Now I had to remove the toxins from Effexor from my body. Regime:  a. Steam Room / Sauna / Hot bath or long hot shower twice every day--with cold shower breaks in between heat sessions to mimic the aspects of fever.  b. cleanser: Triphila and Psyllium husk powder twice a day  c. Dry brush my skin (the skin holds a 1/3 of the body's toxins)  d. 5 day juice fast, with 2 days before and after of raw vegetables/fruits only. Stopped all medications, vitamins, benadryl, colon cleanser, everything during this juice fast. I scheduled the fast approximately 2 weeks after stopping Effexor.  e. Exercise regime every day.  3. AM I NOW IN THE CLEAR?  Here I am 4 weeks after the end of Effexor (and Trazadone -- which I replaced with melatonin). I continue to take vitamins and will do so for quite a while. So ... How am I feeling?  - I don't have words to describe how wonderful it is to have my feelings, emotions and mind back, where I feel that my moods are my own and not manufactured by Effexor.  - Allergies continue to haunt me daily, but each day it gets a bit better, and I take less benadryl.  - No need to remember pill times is wonderful, less dry mouth.  - Still a bit ""low energy"", but it gets better each day.  - Mood is upbeat, feeling hopeful and looking forward to clear windshields everyday!  I hope this help those of you out there planning to come off this drug. I am grateful for Effexor for all it has done to help me over the years. I wished they warned me about the withdrawal. I am grateful for all your suggestions and comments that helped me research and put this regime into place. It worked for me and I probably wouldn't change a thing if I were to do it again.

"If you don't want periods (or PMS) at all there is the 3 monthly injection - Depo-provera - in the UK. It doesn't work the same for everyone (like all medicines) but for me it stopped all periods and kept my depression down to such a level that I could function ""normally"". I stopped having the 1 week mood swings, 1 week misery, 1 week mood swings, 1 week ok cycle. If that's not an option for you there is a herb supplement that I tried called Agnus Castus. It seems to have beneficial effects for most ""women's problems"" from aching breasts to full blown menopause. And it can have the side effect of weight loss (not a bad thing for me ) I was on it for ten years at a time and got to the stage where when I came off it and had a period again I had completely forgotten what they were really like!

"I am always wrong.. I got married with a wrong man.  I have been married for 5 years. I have a baby who is still a month. I realized that i chose the wrong person as husband. He ruined my life.

"Feeling Trapped Hello,  I am 22 and had quite severe depression during the age of 17-18. My past 3 years of life from the ages 19-22 have actually been great and I have had no problems. I have had a girlfriend since the age of 20 whom I love. I have worked a few different mundane jobs, and have been going to school for electrical engineering. I am entering my last year of undergraduate school in the ASU online program.   The reason my depression has returned is because I feel trapped, mainly due to my living situation. I would consider my upbringing to be the low end of middle class, and yes I realize there are people much worse off than I am. I grew up in a family of 6, 2 parents and 4 siblings including myself. For the past 18 years we have lived in an 1800 sq. ft.  town house in California, right off of a busy street. There are 2 rooms in the house. The master bedroom is rather large, I would estimate about 2.5x as big as the other bedroom. Up until a few months ago when my sister moved out, all 4 of us siblings were sharing the smaller room. Now there are 3 of use sharing it, but still two bunk beds taking up the same space. There is absolutely no space, and I am 6'3"" tall and do not really fit into my twin size bunk bed. My mom has kept the large master bedroom for herself over the years, and has forced my father to sleep in the living room, despite the fact that he is the one who pays the bills. She is a selfish person. My desk, which is where I try to study and work, and where I spend most of my time, is in the living room. My dad is usually in the living room watching TV, and there are lots of noise and distractions from other people and the kitchen etc.  which make it nearly impossible to study or just relax.   This didn't really bother me much as a kid, but now that I am 22, it is getting worse and worse everyday. Because I do online schooling (which was not what I intended) , I have little to no interaction with peers and my schooling is basically sitting in front of my computer at home. I feel completely trapped. The bedroom I share is completely cramped, and usually one of my other siblings is in it. In the living room I am surrounded by distractions and other people, with absolutely no privacy. It is hard to study or focus on anything. I feel like I have no space to myself, like there is nowhere to go. I often feel extremely anxious and depressed, and feel as though someone is cramming me into a box. This makes me just want to cease being conscious. All I think about is how badly I need to move out. Every night it is getting worse and worse, until I decided to come here tonight to post.   Due to school payments, and buying a car, it is not possible to move out with the mediocre job that I have. There is still another year until I graduate school, and even then I don't know for certain if I will be able to get a job that will enable me to move out. I will still have to pay off school loans after that. The thought of staying here for another year, or even worse 2-3 years is completely unbearable. My girlfriend and I have made plans to move out together eventually, but that probably wouldn't happen for another 2 years minimum. This had made me extremely depressed and anxious the past 6 months. Does anyone have any advice for what I should do? I have been considering spending more time at libraries during the day.  I have also been trying to spend a little more time outside and at the gym etc. But if anyone else has been in a similar situation, please give me advice.   Note: I know there are people who have it much worse. Homeless, disabled, etc. I realize that and that is the main thing that I try to think about when I feel depressed and anxious. That I have it better than some people. But this is just my personal situation I am trying to deal with.

"I am not able to do breath meditation myself, so I'm a fine one to talk, but I've read that it works. The thoughts will come, no matter what you do. Supposedly the trick with breath mediation is that it gives you distance on the thoughts, helps you ""stand back"" from them a bit, and feel the accompanying emotions but not get as carried away by them. This reinforces your ability to know that they're just thoughts, and they will go away if you don't act on them. And supposedly either with breath meditation or without, there's an element of ""fake it till you make it"" at work here. It's been shown that ""acting out anger"" as a therapeutic tool actually makes getting angry easier than letting go of it, because it maintains the neurological pathways that anger uses. One meditation teacher calls it ""rehearsing anger"". So supposedly if you replace negative thoughts/feelings with positive ones, like caring for the part of you that is angry and hurt, then eventually your brain will reprogram itself to think and feel positive things. Breath meditation has become a non-religious phenomenon in recent years, like yoga. Three books that are just good reading anyway are ""The Art of Happiness"" by the psychiatrist Howard Cutler with the Dalai Lama, ""Destructive Emotions - How Can We Overcome Them?"", by the psychologist Daniel Goleman with the Dalai Lama, and ""Anger- Wisdom For Cooling The Flames"", by Thich Nhat Hanh, all of which discuss breath meditation as a simple practice for ""mental hygiene"" as opposed to a ""religious practice"" of any sort. Supposedly the Dalai Lama was really surprised to hear that ""self-loathing"" is common in Western culture, because it was so uncommon in Tibet- there was just no concept. The point of all this is, with or without meditation, is that if you notice a negative thought or emotion when it arises, rather than struggle with it to try to put it out of your mind, you should just quietly label it as ""negative thought"" and let it go away, and/or replace it with a positive thought, like ""caring for the wounded child within you"". (It's odd to notice that John Bradshaw, the ""king"" of ""healing the wounded child"", and Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, say the same thing about this.) But it's being said that there's a great similarity between Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and meditation practice, because meditation practice recognizes negative self-talk and replaces it with positive self-talk, and supposedly conditions the brain to react in positive ways. In ""Destructive Emotions"" there's a part about brain imaging that shows that people who meditate are activating more positive parts of their brains. And again, these books are just good reading anyway. But like I say, easier said than done. Supposedly it works for some people. I can't do it, but some people can. Maybe you can. If nothing else, all these works, including Bradshaw, are good reading and you may be able to develop positive mental habits and replace the negative mental habits with them. Both breath meditation and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy have been shown to be good adjuncts to recovery from depression, even if the depression itself is being treated with medication.",not able breath meditation myself fine talk read work thought come matter do supposedly trick breath mediation give distance thought help stand back bit feel accompanying emotion not carried away them reinforces ability know just thought away not act them supposedly breath meditation without element fake till make it work here shown acting anger therapeutic tool actually make getting angry easier letting it maintains neurological pathway anger us meditation teacher call rehearsing anger supposedly replace negative thoughtsfeelings positive one like caring angry hurt eventually brain reprogram think feel positive thing breath meditation nonreligious phenomenon recent year like yoga book just good reading the art happiness psychiatrist howard cutler dalai lama destructive emotion overcome them psychologist daniel goleman dalai lama anger wisdom cooling flame thich nhat hanh discus breath meditation simple practice mental hygiene opposed religious practice sort supposedly dalai lama really surprised hear selfloathing common western culture uncommon tibet just concept point is meditation notice negative thought emotion arises struggle try mind just quietly label negative thought let away andor replace positive thought like caring wounded child you it odd notice john bradshaw king healing wounded child thich nhat hanh vietnamese buddhist monk say thing this said great similarity cognitive behavioral therapy meditation practice meditation practice recognizes negative selftalk replaces positive selftalk supposedly condition brain react positive way destructive emotion brain imaging show people meditate activating positive part brain again book just good reading anyway like say easier said done supposedly work people it people can maybe can else work including bradshaw good reading able develop positive mental habit replace negative mental habit them breath meditation cognitive behavioral therapy shown good adjunct recovery depression depression treated medication,0.5749346017837524,0.3647249639034271,0.6487891674041748

"I get depressed, so I procrastinate, so I get more depressed, etc. I hate my job with a burning passion but I can't bring myself to quit or do anything else.  My job is ""prestigious"" and high-paying so it's the only thing that makes me look successful to family and friends, which makes it the only tiny source of self-worth I have. If I lost my job, everyone would know the useless, depressed piece of shit I really am.  I fucking despise my job though, so I can't bring myself to actually do the work. I procrastinate for hours/days and only get anything done by pulling all-nighters right before deadlines. I could have an assignment for two weeks and I will still do it from 2:00 am to 7:00 am the night before it's due.

"I feel so lost Hi. I'm 15 year old girl from India and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. Everybody is passionate about something right? I'm not. I don't ever remember the last time in my life I was genuinely excited about anything. What makes everything worse is that in 1 month, I have to decide what I'm going to do with my life. Here in India, we don't get to pick our classes individually. In junior and senior year, you pick what stream you want (Commerce, Humanities, Medical or Engineering). The first two bore the hell out of me. I'd like to do Medical but I don't think I can study for another ~10 years after high school. I'm good at the Engineering subjects (Physics, Chemistry and Math) and I like CS but I've never really enjoyed doing it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bad at studying. I'm among the top kids at my school. Everybody thinks I have my life figured out and somehow that just makes it worse. I'm fucking terrified of what the future holds. I stay up whole nights crying just going over what is going to happen and trying to achieve some sort of clarity about what I'm going to do. I have tons of friends at school but I've never connected with anyone. There was this one guy I was really good friends with and had a crush on since 6th grade but he changed schools last year and we lost touch. I've tried making actual new friends since then but it's never clicked with anyone. There are good days and bad days, the latter consisting of me drawing all the curtains in my room, turning off the lights, wrapping myself in my blanket and just laying there in the dark. It embarrasses me to admit that that is what I'm doing right now. I really want to go to college in the US just to experience something new for once but med school is really expensive. I just want to feel happy about something for once. Why does nothing interest me anymore? I feel like a robot going through the same routine everyday. Eat, study, sleep, repeat.

"Do you ever feel like why bother we’re all going to die anyhow and all we’ve accomplished and done will be forgotten? I enjoy art, but I often think why bother. I’ll die one day and all my art work will be thrown away. There’s a lot I do enjoy but none of it serves any purpose. After you go on vacation for example you’re just left with the memories, until you get old and forget it all. Sure it was fun at the moment but serves no long term purpose and one day even the memories will be gone. They say enjoy life but why? Animals don’t. They just do what they do. They’re only purpose is to keep their species alive and technically that’s our only purpose in life to keep our species going.

"Help, I'm not sure if my partner is depressed. I need help moving forward. A little background on my partner and our relationship, he's 23 and I'm 21. He lost his mother to sickness when he was 17 years old, dropped out of school because of that and moved away to complete a foundation course. We met while he was back home but he currently studies overseas to complete his bachelor's degree. However, he's been home for the past 2.5 weeks as he is having his semester break.  We began dating a year and 2 months ago. He's been nothing but the most supportive and kind partner I've ever had the honour of dating. Very caring, remembers the little things and is very physically affectionate. However for the past 2.5 weeks, he's been incredibly hot and cold with me. The worst instance having been on Thursday (4 days ago).  We had planned to meet at 2pm, but at 2pm he asks if we can meet at 5pm because 'the weather is too hot'. Fair enough, so we decide to meet at 5pm.  When I meet him, he is cold and withdrawn and does not even acknowledge me. I reach for his hand and he lets me hold it, but the bus ride is filled with nothing but silence. He's looking out the window and he doesn't want to speak to me. We reach our destination and head to a restaurant for early dinner, but he orders one tiny dish and doesn't want to eat anymore because he has no appetite. I asked him what's wrong and he said he's just tired. I asked if he's angry at me and he says no. He continues being very physically affectionate by holding my hand and holding my waist but he doesn't want to make eye contact with me or kiss me. He smiles all of 2 times while we're out.  We then decide to head to a bar (his decision, even though I told him I'm okay with going home), but we just drank our beers in silence, I tried telling him about a book I had just bought but I could tell he was disinterested. While on the way back home, I teared up while telling him that I've been trying so hard to communicate with him but I have just not gotten a response. He tells me that he's tired and it's got nothing to do with me. We head back home and I tell him to text me when he's back home but he doesn't. It's been 4 days since then and I texted him last night but to no response (it's been 24 hours).  Other reasons why I think he may be depressed are:- A week before he came home, he found out his dog of 13 years passed away.  \- He has a very erratic sleep schedule. He'll sleep at 5am, wake up at noon.  \- He doesn't want to do things that we planned to do. We wanted to go for an exhibition and he said we'll go 'next week' but that hasn't happened yet.  \- We haven't had sex in a week.  \- He hasn't met his best friend of a few years even though he's been home for 2.5 weeks.  \- He hasn't made contact with me for 4 days, this is out of the ordinary.  \- He's totally checked out of social media, not stayed up to date with memes and Instagram stories (with the only exception being last night when he watched my Instagram story)  \- His Instagram and Twitter bio is ""Have fun. Be kind. Die."" (!!!!)  I feel so lost and helpless, and I feel like I'm grasping at straws trying to figure out what's going on. I don't know if this could be depression or if it's just a case of him checking out of this relationship. If any of these signs are an indicator, please please please let me know what I can do. I feel especially on edge because he's leaving to go back to uni in a few days but I don't know when I'll be able to see him again.  I don't know how to reach out to him, he didn't respond to my text message and the last thing I want to do is shove him deeper into isolation. Please give me any advice you can on how to go about dealing with the situation. I love him so much and I want to support him, but I don't know how.",help not sure partner depressed need help moving forward little background partner relationship lost mother sickness year old dropped school moved away complete foundation course met home currently study overseas complete bachelor degree however home past week having semester break began dating year month ago supportive kind partner honour dating caring remembers little thing physically affectionate past week incredibly hot cold me worst instance having thursday day ago planned meet pm pm asks meet pm nothe weather hot fair enough decide meet pm meet him cold withdrawn doe not acknowledge me reach hand let hold it bus ride filled silence looking window doe not want speak me reach destination head restaurant early dinner order tiny dish doe not want eat anymore appetite asked wrong said just tired asked angry say no continues physically affectionate holding hand holding waist doe not want make eye contact kiss me smile time out decide head bar his decision told okay going home just drank beer silence tried telling book just bought tell disinterested way home teared telling trying hard communicate just not gotten response tell tired got me head home tell text home doe not day texted night response it hour reason think depressed are week came home dog year passed away erratic sleep schedule sleep am wake noon doe not want thing planned do wanted exhibition said next week not happened yet not sex week not met best friend year home week not contact day ordinary totally checked social medium not stayed date meme instagram story with exception night watched instagram story instagram twitter bio have fun kind die feel lost helpless feel like grasping straw trying figure going on not know depression just case checking relationship sign indicator let know do feel especially edge leaving uni day not know able again not know reach him did not respond text message thing want shove deeper isolation advice dealing situation love want support him not know how,0.3342064917087555,0.48353055119514465,0.38756996393203735

I have a bad personality that appears good. My personality is a result of childhood abuse and depression. I was treated like a subordinate not worthy of shit growing up and now as an adult I'm a people pleaser to the extent of ruining my own life to help others even if they dont need it because I worry about my reputation and want people to constantly think I'm a really good person. I know that it isn't good behaviour but I don't know how to be outside of that. It feels nice to get praised for it but I really want to start accomplishing things for myself and let people handle their own business. I want to be someone.

I'm not really sure what to do and I'm sure no one could really answer this for me but I really wanted to get it off my chest. Idk if anyone else is like this but it sucks. I was doing some research and found martyr syndrome and it really kicked me off my pedalstool and I feel like a piece of shit that sets too high standards and takes too much responsibility on and makes people feel bad.

"Gets worse by the day lately Lately... the depression has been getting worse as each new day arrives. It’s getting to the point where I am afraid of my own mind and thoughts. Lately I’ve been hoping that i don’t wake up from my sleep. In the past six months, I’ve lost two people that I loved so much. One was my best friend of 8 years, we dated for a year and broke up but remained friends until about six months ago. He started to ignore me out of no where. Tried my best to talk to him but... he was the cause of why my depression spiraled back so bad that I almost took my own life. Then I met another guy about 5 months earlier... he liked me, I liked him, I fell in love with him. He knew of my ex/best friend and what he did to me. Guy number two said he wouldn’t do what guy number one did to me... and now I feel like he is doing the same exact thing that guy number one did to me... we haven’t talked in two weeks. I know two weeks isn’t that long to not talk, but... seeing as guy number one didn’t talk to me for two weeks... I can’t help that guy number two is doing the same exact thing and ignoring me and somehow I will lose him as friend. Sadly... I fell really hard for guy number two...    Sorry for the long story but... as a person that’s been battling depression for the last 13 years, I just feel like if I left the world, no one would notice or even care...

"I think letters are a wonderful way to communicate. That way you don't say anything without thinking about it first. I wasn't clear if your mother actually read the letter or not. If she hasn't, I might suggest approaching the letter with just the first issue of the way she treats you (without the father issue) in one letter. That might open dialogue and allow you guys to focus on fixing that first. I understand your fear of authority figures. When I was that age (I'm 31 now) I couldn't talk to anyone of authority. My mom, who was shy herself had to do that kind of stuff for me. Could another one of your relatives go with you to take your drivers test? Nana or Sonny who you mentioned in the letter? If it helps to hear, I did get over my fear of authority figures and sometimes I go overboard and challenge them (to make up for lost time?). I never had psychotherapy, but I wish I had. So don't discount it, nip it in the bud if you are able to. One other question I have is...is your mother ALWAYS this way or does she show moments of tenderness, sympathy or interest in your life? I think that if you've seen the mom in her in the past, it sounds like she has some internal problems that she takes out on you, but have nothing to do with you. Don't worry about how you should be at this age...everyone has their own time clock inside. If we were all the same, this would be a very very boring world.

"GF stopped taking antidepressants So my LDR girlfriend just recently stopped taking antidepressants because her mother pressured her into it. She clearly needs them, she can barely function without them and I told her but she refuses to take them again. Her mother, by the way, is bipolar and very mentally abusive. It seems like my GF had been convinced by her mother that not taking meds is the way to go. I told my parents about this and they agree with her not taking them, claiming it’ll help the “chemicals leave her body.” I don’t know what to do. I want to support her decision but her getting off her meds is clearly affecting her negatively and she’s even sadder and less motivated to do anything now. It’s currently impossible for us to live together and we visit each other 1-2 times a year when school is out. We’re both in uni.   I myself stopped taking antidepressants cold turkey as well (that was about 5 years ago) and I’m still depressed but not to the point where I can’t go out and do what I’m supposed to like she is experiencing right now. I love her and want to be with her forever but I don’t know how to help at this point, she’s not receptive to my help and hates herself and has no friends where she lives, a small town in Canada.",gf stopped taking antidepressant ldr girlfriend just recently stopped taking antidepressant mother pressured it clearly need them barely function told refuse again mother way bipolar mentally abusive like gf convinced mother not taking med way go told parent agree not taking them claiming help chemical leave body not know do want support decision getting med clearly affecting negatively sadder motivated now currently impossible live visit time year school out uni stopped taking antidepressant cold turkey that year ago depressed not point supposed like experiencing right now love want forever not know help point not receptive help hate friend life small town canada,0.43840840458869934,0.3904198110103607,0.5130528211593628

"Finished my goodbye letters. Would just like to vent a little before I hang up my hat... For the last two months I went through hell with my relationship to my GF that I was planning on proposing to right before this all began. Since May she's been telling me how she's depressed and doesn't know why and that our relationship is failing because of it. I did absolutely everything I could to help even changing so many things about myself. This went on for over a month until she said we needed to take a break which we began to and for the next month we were on and off yet still living together and in my eyes things were turning around for the better. Well, June 29th I found out the reason for all this was that she was talking to a co-worker that lives down the street and began sleeping with him while I was at work. Unfortunately I snapped and went to confront the guy which she blocked the door from me leaving and I just ripped it open hitting her with the door not even thinking bruising her shoulder. 4 days later she calls the cops and 2 days after that I'm arrested for domestic battery. We were planning a life together and I've never felt so betrayed. After a couple days I began to see the light and once I did my mother had a heart attack and I can't help but blame myself for putting her through all this stress. Normally if I had family problems I would turn to Kaitlyn my GF and if I had GF problems I would speak to my mother or my brother who lives half way across the country. Well, now I have no one to turn to and I'm spiralling out of control. Last night I spent a few hours writing my goodbyes and have been collecting a variety of sleeping pills and muscle relaxers. Im gonna try and enjoy the next couple days and then I'm pulling all my money out of the bank to go find a beautiful scenery and make that my last memory. You've always been a huge help Reddit over the last few years but this is my breaking point. If convicted which I most likely will be according to my lawyer then the rest of my life is tarnished and getting a good job will be next to impossible. Hell I'll probably lose my current job once my name begins to get drug through the mud... Idk where I'm going with this just really needed to vent to someone that isn't gonna just tell me keep your chin up and things will get better like my friends and family. They just don't understand the dark place that I'm in right now. I've dealt with what I believe to have been mild depression for about the last 15 years living in a very racist area and being half fillipino and half white.

"Feeling insecure that my friend hates me I'm really stressing out right now. This happens all the time, I feel like my closest friend hates me. But recently, it's been getting bad. He's been ignoring me in person, taking forever to text back, and being really passive aggressive while texting me.

"How much longer can I fake it? I'm 33, had a full-time job for several years and have a young son.  I took a leave from work in 2014 for mental illness, at which point I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, prescribed Zoloft and was back at work when my short term disability ran out.  This was the first time I'd been on anti-depressants.  I felt tired all the time, had no sex drive, and started gaining weight, but at least I was functional.    Over the next year, I received a few verbal warnings and 1 written warning at work about my poor performance.  Eventually, the mask broke and I was on leave again in 2015.  This time I was away for much longer, was diagnosed w/ dysthymia, tried several different medications, found out that just about every SSRI gave me horrible side effects (sweating, nausea, insomnia, no sex drive, I'm actually thinking now that maybe they caused serotonin syndrome) and eventually landed on Remeron and Wellbutrin.  This combo actually started to work, without any side effects (except for weight gain, which I've been managing with a diet now).  This time, I returned to work because I received notice in the mail that my employment was going to be terminated because it was coming up on 2 years without being at work.  I figured if I was going to be fired for not returning, I may as well return, make some money and worst thing that happens is I get fired anyways.  I was not better when I returned to work, I was functional, I was able to smile, but the low mood persisted in a big way.  And so here I am, still working, trying to fake it everyday, feeling like a house of cards thats ready to topple.  I'm afraid because if I go off work again that will have been 3 leaves of absence, and I really don't think I could show my face around here anymore after that.  I remember how horrible my life felt when I was on medical leave.  I remember falling behind on child support, having to borrow money from my parents.  I remember trying to convince my girlfriend that my low sex drive was because of meds and not because of her.  I remember trying to convince an insurance company that I'm sick, while simultaneously trying to convince myself that I can get better.  I remember feeling like a useless waste of skin that drained on the resources of everyone that dared to care about me.  I guess what I'm saying is I know, right now, I'm suffering from depression, and I'm afraid of what might happen if I admit that again.",longer fake it fulltime job year young son took leave work mental illness point diagnosed depression anxiety disorder prescribed zoloft work short term disability ran out time antidepressant felt tired time sex drive started gaining weight functional year received verbal warning written warning work poor performance eventually mask broke leave time away longer diagnosed w dysthymia tried different medication just ssri gave horrible effect sweating nausea insomnia sex drive actually thinking maybe caused serotonin syndrome eventually landed remeron wellbutrin combo actually started work effect except weight gain managing diet now time returned work received notice mail employment going terminated coming year work figured going fired not returning return make money worst thing happens fired anyways not better returned work functional able smile low mood persisted big way am working trying fake everyday feeling like house card thats ready topple afraid work leaf absence really not think face anymore that remember horrible life felt medical leave remember falling child support having borrow money parent remember trying convince girlfriend low sex drive med not her remember trying convince insurance company sick simultaneously trying convince better remember feeling like useless waste skin drained resource dared care me guess saying know right now suffering depression afraid happen admit again,0.5942432284355164,0.5295790433883667,0.6699346899986267

"OK, for you guys out there- I apologize ahead of time... It's that time of the month for me - and I thought I was doing pretty well until this afternoon. It's like my hormones, brain chemicals and whatever else have done a complete 180 on me. Driving home today I prayed I would just make it safely because I was starting to feel so out of control. I want to scream (which I can't because of where I live) or break things- or whatever else to get this anger out!!!  I don't even know where it's coming from!!

"I'm 16 and I've thought about suicide some, never tried yet. I'll tell you about myself. I'm in high school ...   just got my license.

Now I've been recently noticing (for a small bit months now) how I have been having some I guess you would say symptoms (pardon my spelling) of depression and all. Especially I've been losing interest in things and feeling guilty over everything and that's the most extreme ones, I have some others too. I've taken online tests and it says that I may have depression. But I can't believe I do. I mean why would I have depression. I would just guess I'm making it up to myself or something. We'll I've always been interesting in  psychology stuff like personality disorders, so maybe I'm just reading into it wrong or something. That would probably be what a shrink would say so I don't want to go to one, plus I don't really like talking to them. Another thing is one of my friends just attempted suicide, lucky survived and if I say something to someone they would think I'm just saying such because of that.

"I'm a 33 year old man with a history of depression (I was diagnosed when I was 10) and of ""standing apart"" -- not refusing to fit in out of some sense of rebellion, but not fitting in simply because I couldn't. I have never been married. I've had only one long term relationship -- it was long - distance and very turbulent for both my partner and I (the relationship ended three years ago). To this day I wonder why I don't ""measure up"", why I can't seem to find my place in life. While not physically stunning by any means, I never thought I was hideous, either -- though my looks have most often been pointed out to me as a shortcoming, so that's the explanation I tend to go with most of the time. When I hit my teenage years, panic disorder became a problem, too (as I realized how little control I had over my life and the way it was going to turn out). At the beginning of each year, I stand back and take stock of my situation, asking myself: where am I right now? Which direction am I headed in from here? What are my options? Up until now, I could always find some reason to be at least a little hopeful, to keep going -- but this year I can't. I've been out of work for a long time, the panic attacks are getting bad again, I've had a number of relatively minor but still worrisome health problems in the last few months -- and worst of all, after so many years, I'm still alone. There are no prospects out there; no one wants to be with me. I'm in a lot of pain and I don't know how to make it better. This is not just a temporary slump, it's my whole life, but it hurts even worse now than it used to.

"My mother pt.2 I posted about my issues with my mother the other day, and I have discovered new information. She's been complaining to her boyfriend, and he has a busy mouth, so naturally he's spilled it all. I've learned that my mother never wanted me to move back in with her after I lost my apartment, and she's been saying she buys me lots of things: clothes, computers, etc. And I just toss them aside and never use them, because I'm an ungrateful child. So she just took the stuff and started wearing the clothes. None of that is true. What's probably going on here is that she's buying herself things, and using me as a scapegoat so she doesn't have to tell her boyfriend she has money, or bought things for herself. Or she's just delusional and making shit up. Maybe even that she's stealing clothes from me and covering that way. I could believe any of that. Either way, she wants me to leave, and I know she does. And that hurts like a mother. No pun intended. What I want to do is get custody of my younger brother, and leave the state. Just start over, and make sure my brother is raised in a safe and nurturing environment. Because I can't live with knowing that he's growing up in the same toxicity that I did, and how it'll fuck him up like it did me. She's two-facing everyone; talking shit to one person, then smiling to the person's face she just trashed. And if anyone tries to call her out, she gets pissed and plays dumb. Her sugar daddies have been showing up at the house. She does drugs on the daily. She's going to end up old, a lone, and with her kids and family hating her, no one coming to see her.

"Why did they forget me? I was never someone people would consider anti-social. Rather, I was the opposite. I loved talking to people, meeting new people, and just being social. In highschool, I never had a ""group"" of friends per se, but I knew almost everyone in my grade, and was friends with a lot of them. After high school, I went to a local university, so I'd have to commute to my school, unlike the rest of my classmates who went to to schools further away. My current university is a huge commuter school, so there's no on campus experience to be had, and I'm actually transferring to a local community college instead, so I can transfer out later. Through all this, the friends I had in high school have all kind of forgotten about me. Even in high school, I'd be the first to message people, or the one to initiate hangouts and whatnots. But now, in college, its the same but so much more lonely. All my friends are away, and I'm rotting here. I feel so alone. On top of this, I miss my ex from a year ago. We went from meeting, to best friends, to huge fallout, to reconciliation, to best friends, to dating, to nothing. I miss the friend part. This loss has dampened my mood for a year now. Just overall, I feel so lonely. A year ago I felt on top of the world, and now, I'm back to shit. All I ever wanted was someone to message me first saying ""Hey dude, how are ya?"" Its been a while"". The worst was Thanksgiving break, where I had excitedly messaged a few people saying I'm so happy to see them and we (read: I asked to) made plans to hangout.

"Depressed people get sick, too; How stigma in the medical community made me sicker I’ve often found myself in a chicken and egg situation with my doctors when it comes to depression.   When I say I’m sick, they are too quick to assume the depression is the cause of my pain and not the other way around. After five minutes listening to me breathe, looking into my throat, and and touching the outside of my neck, they are stumped so it must be mental illness. It got the the point that when I was having severe abdominal pain, I didn’t go to the hospital. I had to push for any kind of testing, which took forever. When I finally found a doctor who listened to me, she told me I should have gone to the ER. Then I was depressed about that; I had let the other doctors make me doubt my own sanity.  Turns out, I’ve been pretty sick and needed surgery. Nearly all of the issues they blamed on depression were due to a chronic, painful illness with no cure. It’s bittersweet, I’ve solved a big piece of the puzzle for sure. But I’m still struggling a lot.  I just found out that I may be infertile. After my doctor said having a baby could help my condition. So that was depressing too. (I don’t think my depression caused my infertility. Checkmate, doctors!)  I did start seeing a psychiatrist, and he is a kind man. He diagnosed me with depression and anxiety. He has never suggested that my depression is the cause of my physical problems, and he seems to be sympathetic to me as a chronic pain patient. He’s given me depression medication, but I don’t know how much it’s helping. Chronic illness is a thing that happens to people and it’s just *depressing*. I’ve always had depression, but this just makes it worse. He has never dismissed me for feeling that way or written off my pain as being in my head.  Just wanted to share my experience with others who might understand. People with depression can experience health issues and get dismissed so easily. It took me years and years to get anywhere. It’s a struggle to cope with both mental and physical illness. Here’s to getting through today, friends.

It was mainly her abusing me at first, getting angry for not texting her quickly enough, coming at my neck for hanging out with friends everynight ( I assume was because she stayed home all the time) and so on. The last couple times we dated she was always angry with me for cheating (which I never did) later to find out she was the one cheating on me. I was extremely depressed once we finally cut ties that I went back and talked to her and then she told me she cheated in detail so she could bring me down more.  After the breakup I ended up getting sick and after a couple months couldn’t even bring myself to take care of myself. Small stuff like wearing my retainer and showering before 5pm was the hardest part of my day. I know that seems small but it plays into how I feel now.  3 months after the breakup I started talking to a friend I met through my ex (however they were not and still aren’t friends anymore) and we’ve been happily together for almost a year now. There was a lot of useless drama with my ex about this which has been resolved but she still tries to harass me and my girlfriend. Last month she texted my phone from her friends number trying to harass me and it was just ridiculous.   Unfortunately I have to see her in May for my girlfriend’s prom, they are in the same senior class and I an currently a college sophomore. I still feel as though I am in a rough place and don’t physically look as good as I should. Stuff such as my teeth and acne and other results of that loss of hygeine that I still struggle with makes me feel like I have been doing worse than her, which I know shouldn’t matter but it still bothers me. I’ve tried getting my old habits back which work for a month and then I lose track again.  I guess my overall issue is I compare myself how I was when with her to where I am now, mostly with my appearance. I’m also still very depressed and feel that it puts me below her now. My only real win is that I’ve nearly kicked my drug addiction (mainly weed, I was using it to runaway from my problems) but now I can’t seem too kick my other habits of nicotine addiction and taking any kind of pill or cough syrup just to not be sober. I’ve distanced myself from friends and I simply feel lost and useless to the world. In college I can’t make new friends and just sit in my dorm room wishing I could go back and start over so I could be healthier than I am now.  I’m looking for advice or anyone to be straightforward with me on any aspect of my situation. Thank you to anyone who reads this and responds!

"I thought things were getting better... Sorry for the little rant... I just needed to say this somewhere.  After recently getting out of the hospital for a(nother) attempt at my life, I was surrounded by family and friends who want to support me. For a couple days this almost gave me a high, thinking that maybe I really am glad I wasn't able to go through with it or that maybe I was beating these years of depressiveness. Not even just after a week of getting out of the mental ward, I fantasize about what I could have done differently to have made sure I died that night. Going forward I thought I would be happy being able to see my younger siblings and my dog again, yet the only thing I can think of is them knowing I tried killing myself, and that I have added just another thing to deal with and another burden on them. I will now be treated with *care* and people will be on guard around me, and I didn't want to do that to them. This semester has started again and I have already missed the first week, and while part of me just wants to drop everything, I can't afford to start paying back the loans. I just want to curl into a ball and not exist and have to deal with it all.

"Feeling numb I’ve realized that if I can’t talk to someone about my feelings then the next best thing is to write them down and seek advice from reddit so here I am. I’m on campus right now preparing for my midterm and my confidence is at an all time low. I haven’t even seen the paper and already I feel as if I’ve lost. I never thought I would reach such a low in my life. Something weird happened today. I finally set up a countdown timer to the day my exam results are announced. That seemed like the next logical step and it made complete sense to me in a weird way. The only thing that made me remove that was talking to my parents and seeing the hope and love for me in their eyes. I know my life isn’t truly mine and that if I hurt myself then I also hurt other people but it’s just getting too much. The thought is always there in my mind and for the past few days that voice has gotten stronger. I’ve been through this period before and had come out nearly unharmed and at the beginning of the year I was feeling optimistic about what’s to come but that lasted all of one month. The future I was dreaming of looks bleak and distant and with every passing minute that future keeps on going farther and farther away from me. I try very hard to keep my guard up near people I know and love but it’s becoming harder and harder to do so. I used to think that I was destined to do some good in the world but maybe that was just me being delusional. It’s getting harder to keep the tears in. Whenever I used to feel numb, I used to punch the wall just to feel something but even that is not helping now. All I wanna do is talk to someone and pour my heart out but I don’t know if I have the strength left to do that. Getting out of bed is starting to feel like a struggle and for the first time in a while I’m afraid of myself, of what I might do if things don’t go my way. I know that this is not the end of the line but why does it feel like it is? How can anyone recover from such a failure? It’s gotten so bad that I would much rather prefer that I disappeared than having to tell my parents what’s wrong. Depression is nothing new for my university and it wouldn’t be the first time that someone took a drastic step and now I know why they did what they did. The pressure and stress which comes with a university as respected as mine, is just too much to handle. I’m almost inclined to reveal my university’s name just in case someone’s able to figure out who I am and I can finally get the respite I desire so much. All around me I see happy faces and I can only hope that one day I can leave all this behind me and be happy but in the meantime I guess I just have to struggle on and wait for the light at the end of the tunnel.

i'm not really sure what i want to say here. I was sexually abused by my brother from the age of 4 until i was about 17. He hung himself when i was 20. i'm 34 now and just finding it hard to get a handle on life. I never really thought of what happened to me as being a big deal but my partner has made me think again about what happened in the past. my most formative years were disrupted and i believe i am still suffering as a result.  I suppose i am just wondering if anyone has any advice or knows of anyone who was in a similar situation. I am in counseling at the moment and am just starting to face my demons. I came off my depression / anxiety medications. i felt they were stopping me from really feeling and i felt i needed to be fully aware of my feeling in order to work through this and be able to let go. at the moment i don't see an end to all this. ,not really sure want say here sexually abused brother age hung just finding hard handle life really thought happened big deal partner think happened past formative year disrupted believe suffering result suppose just wondering advice know similar situation counseling moment just starting face demon came depression anxiety medication felt stopping really feeling felt needed fully aware feeling order work able let go moment not end this,0.37321946024894714,0.4602629840373993,0.5194205641746521

"I am starting to feel really frustrated with life because there are things I don't understand about the world. My problem is I think too much and I wish I was off in space thinking about a night out in the city but I'm not. Instead I focus on every negative thing I can. I would never kill myself and because I wouldn't do that I really want to know how I can get over all this shit and be happy with what I got. I don't know if it's my mind playing the victim but I feel like everyone close to me is out to hurt me. For example I am 20 and I don't have a car. I can understand I should already have it like two years ago but this a prime point for my parents to pick on me. For some reason my mom got herself into a bit of a mood and started having a go at me which caused me to end up in tears because she told me I am hopeless and so are all my brothers and that I am an embarrassment. This is all because I don't have a car! She's usually really caring but she came out with all this stuff. Am I going crazy or is it really a huge deal to not yet have a car? Is it worth hurting your daughter over?? Then there is my supposed ""boyfriend"" who picks on me about my weight. I am not as thin as I once was. I've put on about 10 kilos in 3 years. I know it's not a good thing but for ages everything was about my weight. I used to weigh 54 kg which is tiny and now I am 64kg. My boyfriend is at university and thinks that my life holds no meaning because I apparently have no hobbies and I just turn up to my ""little job"".  I have friends that are completely selfish and I always end up paying for everything and they can't even do me a simple favor. I don't want to play the victim because I've been a punching bag for so many people who themselves have played the victim so it's nothing I would aspire to be.     I could write pages and pages and pages of how annoyed I am but I thought I'd just give an idea. I'm sick of people being the way they are to me and making me out to be a energy drain.

"Trying to understand my depressed SO I'm sorry if I'm posting in the wrong sub. I just figured you guys could offer perspective  So my SO is away for work (for more than a month), but we are still in the same time zone. Lately, he's been having bad episodes, but a week ago he said he had a really session with his therapist there. (I'm proud to say that he said I was the only person who managed to convince him to seek professional help!) So, okay, so far so good.   When he has bad days, sometimes he likes to ""check out of the world"". He also feels that opening up about his struggles might be too much of a burden for me. But we had a discussion before wherein I said, I understand that you might need space, but let me know if you're having a bad day, and you're not in a chatty mood. Not sure if this was the right approach, but this was the time before the therapist and after we learned that he had to be away for more than a month. And for the most part, he's been open with me.   This weekend really bothered me because it was radio silence, despite my check ins, and despite not asking ""how are you questions"". For example, we are both big football/soccer fans so I tried to talk about the World Cup. He is a huge fan of the French team which won the Cup.  Nothing.   My anxious nature is making things more challenging because now I'm thinking is it the depression or relationship issues? My anxious self might pester him for answers but I am not sure if that is helpful.  So, I'm not sure how to go about this. Let him be and try not to freak out until he returns?

"During my high school years I was always a little ""klooster"" never went out that much never did anything bad .....

"Well I'm new here so here goes nothing.  I have been diagnosed clinically depressed, along with obsessive compulsive disorder.  I'm 32 years old.

In 2005, I lost both my sister (suicide) and my father (heart attack), and those events only added to the trauma I'd been going through.  I live in a small town, so when I went to the doctor about possible ADHD (i was moody, couldn't focus on work, couldn't complete tasks on time etc), they determined I was bipolar and put me on Effexor and Wellbutrin.  Well that just did absolutely nothing.  In fact my anger with the world increased dramatically and I had rage episodes that about destroyed my second marriage.  I've had a lot of rage in the past.  Recently I haven't had any outbursts.  I'm currently taking Cymbalta and Celexa and that seems to be a good combination.   But I still have a hard time going to work, and functioning throughout the day.  I'd rather stay at home, in my bedroom, away from people most of the time.  That's what bothers me.

"Hi, sorry if this turns into a lengthy post, but I could do with some advice, and I think this is probably the best place to ask. Firstly, I should point out, I am a 19 year male. My problem is that I am concerned by the physical effects the depression is having on me. I have probably been suffering from depression for several years, but I only sought medical help last November after I had a breakdown. The doctor has prescribed me with Fluoxetine, and I am taking 40mg per day. I originally started off on 20mg per day, but after I told the doctor what I will tell you now, about 2 months ago, he ""upgraded"" my status to severe depression, hence the increase in dosage. I can appreciate that my mindset is slightly biased towards feeling negative, and expecting the worst, but nevertheless I can't help but feel my symptoms might be the result of an even more serious problem. The medication has helped my mind (even though I still have plenty of lows, they aren't always as severe as they were 6 months ago), yet my physical health is deteriorating to the point where that's the main factor preventing me from accomplishing day to day tasks. My symptoms are as follows (and they may be generalized, I'll admit): Constant fatigue, even after plenty of rest; constant aching throughout the body; generally feeling very weak, lacking energy and strength, e.g. carrying shopping home can leave my arms in agony; loss of coordination, I have become very clumsy, always knocking glasses over, or dropping things for no reason; occasional loss of balance, usually when getting up, or starting to walk from a stand still; joints are feeling slightly stiff, they still move, but I can feel more resistance than normal and they get very tired very quick if was to use them, or even just hold my arms straight out in front of me; and for me, the worst symptom is an almost constant tremor in both hands and arms, which sometimes spreads throughout the body. If I attempt slow, fine movements with my hands, the tremor becomes very clear and results in jerky movements. Also, I like to exercise, yet after all exercises, even low intensity ones, the trembling seems to intensify. I doubt it is anxiety, as I still shake when I am calm, relaxed and immobile. I know I can't expect I diagnosis, but I would appreciate it if anyone can tell me if the severity of the physical effects I am experiencing, is quite common, even when the mental state is much more relaxed and beginning to recover?

"When people with good intentions say the wrong shit.. How do you deal with it? When someone who is just trying to help you says something that cuts you really deeply, or when they are pushing you when you just need them to back off while. How do you personally deal with it?

He encouraged me to go see a therapist again for the first time in years and was just there to talk and encourage. Then when he saw progress he started pushing more and more and I started getting really stressed. Then when I had a break down and started slipping back he took said some shit to me which really cut me deep. I stopped talking to him for a while after that.

It's been months and I just don't want to talk to or see him at all. He's reaching out again and I can't find the words to  explain the anger and hurt I feel, because I feel like I shouldn't be angry or hurt. So it's just a big spiral of anger and shame.   The worst part is I don't know of I can ever have the same relationship I had with him before. We were buddies. Even if I get over this I just don't know if the trust will ever be back.

"I️ owe 31k in student loans, my mom owes 52k in PLUS loans on my education. I️ feel so terrible.. I’m the first of my 3 siblings to go to college. I got depressed and wasted a year. Now I’m on my 5th year and I won’t graduate till one more semester in the fall. I’ve been working too but I only make enough to cover some of my living expenses. My school schedule only lets me work around 30 hours a week. My mom has helped me out by taking out Parent PLUS loans for me which she is responsible to repay after I graduate. So far she owes $52k while I owe $31k. I feel so shitty, I can’t believe Ive put her through all of this. My dad doesn’t work so it’s just her, and my siblings have yet to finish college (one of them is starting in a couple years). I’m so pissed off at myself, how did I let this happen? If I had my act together I could’ve graduated earlier. I hate myself so much for this, I always prided myself on keeping my mom from harm but she’s going to be in so much debt. It’s so unfair, if I had thought this through maybe she wouldn’t be in this position. Im so close to graduation but so fucking scared. What if I don’t get a job right away? I always said I’d repay my loans then repay my mom but $52k is so much money. More than I’ve ever seen in my life. I’m just taking advantage of her at this point. I’m such a fucking trainwreak.

"Helping a girlfriend with depression possibly? Hello,  I want to first off say this is a throwaway. I also looked for similar post regarding what I will ask, but i really want a tailored answer for my own sanity. Sorry for being selfish, this is just hard. I have been dating this girl for almost a year and I know she has been slipping into an abyss of what I cannot diagnose, but seems like depression. I will start with a time table.  We began dating after meeting on a popular dating app and we hit it off fast. Similar interest, goals, outlooks, expectations, and lifestyle. We became extremely close with in two months and then out of the blue she tells me its over. I didn't feel it was a justifiable way to end the relationship. I contacted her and we had long winded email correspondence with in which she had this quote to me "" I feel lost at work, lost in my personal life, and just lost with trying to find my happiness. You do make me happier. And idk what just snapped last week but I was super depressed all week .""  I talked with her and we set small goals to rekindle and help her find her happiness. We got back together with in two weeks and that started a prolonged honeymoon period for which we traveled, went on ski trips, took our dogs on hikes, and generally enjoyed ourselves.  This continued until march or 2018, when I noticed her slipping back in to her just overall never satisfied state. I got worried and tried to lightly push her to no avail. I then tried to make plans at least twice a month to help distract her and give her a solid thing to look forward to. She never changed and just got worse to the point where the last 2 months, she gets home from work smokes enough weed to put me to sleep, eats too much and then goes to sleep by 9. I tried to encourage by proxy by going to the gym and going to parks with her dog and taking pictures and even getting closer with her family. nothing worked.  Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, she went to Sweden on a vacation with her best friend and had a blast and was calling me everyday so happy and excited. I thought we had a legitimate break through. Then one week before she returns i start to only get 1 or 2 text a day, I figure she is living her best life to busy with international travel to communicate regularly like she requested.  She returns and we spend one night together and she calls me at school to come over to her place asap. she dumps me with little to no explanation. I met with her once more to voice my opinion and she was just quiet and had nothing to say but sorry and that i deserve someone who loves me like Love her. Today she starts emailing me about how she just needs space and she wants me to still talk to her family.  I really do not know what to think...  My friends say fuck her move on.  I have never had a connection or love for someone outside my family and I have had at least 3 relationships over 2 years (I am almost 30). This one really felt different, the way she looked in my eyes and the way we talked about all our joint desires, just felt so good.  I just want everyone to know I am open to honest responses and please feel free to speak openly, I just hurt because I feel like this is when she needs me most, but also might just need her own time to figure her self out.

"Hey, My name is Jonathan. I'm 23 years old. I'm a senior in college hoping to be through very VERY soon. I went through a really rough depression era starting around the age of 15 and lasting till I was 21. It started to get a little better when I got into college, but then severely accelerated throughout the years. I took a year off from school to work and basically to get help, which I did. I found out a lot of my depression was cognitive... thinking negatively about myself. When I was growing up, I was a real shy guy. I think some of that though has turned into a social anxiety issue, but I didn't have a great social. I still don't, but once I got help, the psychologist I saw really helped me get past the negative thinking, but I still have really tightly bound emotional issues from time to time that tend to really upset me. It's taken pieces of my personality and completely do a 180. Part of my depression was that I was co-dependent. Now I'm really completely independent. I guess I'm trying more to understand than to get just advice.

"The only thing that can happen in such a boring world is terror. Or something. Did you se the footage from Monrovia (that's in Liberia, for any Americans who might be reading this...)? I can't understand how these kids are just walking around firing their AKs as if they are hanging out after school. You don't tend to see the other side but I assume it's the same. There was a shot of a group of kids nonchalantly lounging around on the back of a pickup truck upon which was mounted an old-fashioned looking heavy machine-gun, the kind with an armored shield and mounted on a pivot, maybe a mobile anti-aircraft gun. The truck wasn't moving, the gun was in use. So why were a bunch of kids just sitting there? Don't human beings usually seek to protect themselves from danger? Why do people involved in a fire fight walk around as if they were popping out to the shops for a six pack and a box of 200 B & H? Despite 3 weeks service in the Israeli army, I have yet to experience any sort of hostile activity which goes beyond the emotional... What do you do when everything you were told turned out to be bullshit and you realize that everyone you know is deluded? I have started to experience intense rages which appear to be provoked by my girlfriend, who, it seems, thinks that the purpose of a relationship is to psychoanalyze one's partner destructively, to the point of inducing a breakdown. Or something. I have lashed out at her, hitting and screaming and have, during intense screaming matches, to beat my fists against the wall. This is the best I can do to prevent myself from smashing her to pieces. My right hand still hurts me from a couple of days ago. She closes the windows to try to spare the neighbors any unpleasantness. God knows what they must think. Like I could give a fuck. I am inconsiderate, I am selfish, I am a bastard, I have a cold attitude to others, I am a snob, I have contempt for everyone. I don't know which is my stuff and which is hers. I am thinking more of suicide these days. I used to have the regular teenage fascination with my mortality and the potential termination thereof. We were going to try for a baby but she has a hormonal condition which seems quite serious. I have to go wank in a jar and see if my tadpoles are doing whatever it is they should do. She wants me to consider going off with another woman to procreate if it turns out she is infertile. This fills me with rage. I will not tell you why. If you don't understand this you don't understand. What does anyone understand? Is life ever going to change? I am starting to suffer from a new sort of depression. I am starting to feel like I am 31 and the old passion is really not there anymore. Everything is hopeless but it can't ever change.

"I'm 15 and have been depressed for about a year. i got over it for a little while but now i am back to all the pain. I cut myself for the first time a couple weeks ago and now i can't stop. I always reach for my knife when I'm alone and hurting.  One of my major problems is that I'm really good at hiding my feelings. No one knows that I'm depressed and no one except my best friend knew that i cut myself. I told my best friend because we tell each other everything when I told her the only thing she could say was ""you're Crazy"" Not exactly the reaction i was expecting especially since she once told me that she cut herself because we got into a huge fight. And even though I knew she was only saying it for attention and she had no scars on her wrist the next day, i still supported her. But now she is turning her back on me. I think she thinks I'm doing it for attention but I'm not. if i were i wouldn't hide the scars under my wrist band and long sleeve shirts. Any way so now i have no one there to talk to. I don't trust anyone anymore and I'm too scared to tell my parents. Even if i did they can't do anything. I have 3 other brothers and my parents don't have the time or money to deal with my problems.  I really scare myself. I have already planned out how I'm going to kill myself if i do and i tempt myself all the time i never have the guts to go through with it all the way but I still try.

"Feeling good about helping people Does anyone else here ever feel better about themselves when you're able to offer a little help or guidance to someone off the street you don't know?  As an example, sometime last month I was having a pretty meh day, just... Not feeling the worst ever, but not feeling very good either, when on my way home I happened to find an iPhone sitting on a grate outside the subway station.  I picked it up and looked around for the owner, then after entering the station found a couple of young women searching their bags and I asked if the phone was theirs. It was, and they said ""thank you so much!"" And I felt really happy that I'd been able to help them, like, I just kinda decided right then to forget about my problems, because, I'd helped someone. Like, maybe those two would have never found their phone if I hadn't come along. I mean they probably would have, but, y'know. I felt like I'd been helpful in a real small but meaningful way and that felt good.  I really like helping people, but I usually get upset when I try to help people I actually know personally, because, well, people don't always want help with more personal issues, or even with simple issues from people they know well, and trying to tell when to help or not is just really complicated. Like, I'll just real nicely try to suggest a solution to a problem, or simply offering some consolation, and instead of, I dunno, actually trying it or telling me patiently why that isn't a good idea, they just rail on me and tell me to shut up or whatever. And I just feel like, jeez, what'd I do? I'm trying to help here...  And I always get real upset about that and doubt myself over it, like, am I doing a bad thing by trying to be nice? I know that's not true, I get sometimes people want to figure things out on their own, or I guess you don't like my attitude or blablabla, but, I dunno, you can't maybe acknowledge that I'm trying to do good?  But in a situation where it's just strangers, trying to find their way, cross the street, lost a thing or whatever, it's easy to tell when they need help, because everything's a lot more straightforward, if that makes sense. If someone needs help, it's usually pretty obvious and they're almost always pretty receptive to help, and, provided you just look like a normal person, they don't judge. No biases or baggage over past interactions or whatever, they're just happy to have help.  So yeah I guess this is a little longer than it needs to be, but, yeah.

"Every Day is Exactly the Same. I'm Lonely, Worthless, and Done With Life Every day, I wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep. That's basically it. That's my life. Sure, I have a few friends that I see on the weekends, but it only helps so much.  My ex girlfriend broke up with me and moved out of our apartment 6 months ago now. The almost three years we were together were the only time in my life where my depression was pretty much nonexistent. When she came home that day and told me she was done, I was floored. I had no idea that she felt the way she did, and she wouldn't even discuss the matter with me.  I've tried meeting other people since then, and I've gone on exactly three dates with one person. That's it. I'm basically invisible to women, and no amount of effort will ever change that. I just have to accept the reality that I hold absolutely no value in a romantic context. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's because my generation is only interested in people who are aesthetically in the top tier, or make the most money. Maybe it's because my generation is eschewing committed relationships in favor of having fuck buddies left and right, whoring themselves out to whoever will get their rocks off, both men and women are at fault for this. I don't think I'm a particularly unattractive guy, and I make a pretty damn good amount of money for my age, but since I'm not in that top 10% of men, I'm just always going to be passed over and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. It's almost like there something inherent to my existence that prevents me from having any intimacy. No matter how much money I make or how much I improve myself, that intrinsic quality of my being will always hold me back. I didn't ask for this, but it's the way things are, so I've pretty much given up completely.  I don't have any plans of offing myself or anything like that. But every day, it gets harder and harder to convince myself that I actually have anything worth living for. The one thought I keep coming back to is how scared my cat would be if I gave her to a shelter or how she'd get by if I were gone. I love my cat, and she doesn't deserve to be put in a situation like that. I feel like she's the only thing keeping me marginally together. The thought of causing her any distress breaks my heart, and one of the big things on my mind all the time is simply making sure she's happy and feels safe.  I feel worthless and frustrated. I wish I understood how to achieve what I want in life and be happy, but I guess that's just not in the cards. I can't wait until the day I die, I'll finally get some goddamn peace and quiet. I'm so tired of feeling broken. I'm so tired of constantly being reminded that there's something wrong with me, like I'm some sort of bastard aberration of what humans are supposed to be.

"Painfully lonely and spiraling into the worst depression I've ever been in I recently moved to a new city for a job after college. I have a few friends at work, but they're a group of guys that I don't have a lot in common with and we don't really talk outside of the occasional work conversation. They're nice and I'm happy to be friends with them, but it's hard for me to really get to know them because they do ""guy stuff"" on the weekends (like sitting around drinking and playing FIFA) that I'm totally not interested in/they don't bother inviting me to. Other than that, I have a few online friends that I'm growing increasingly dependent on for social interaction which is really unhealthy. I notice myself getting more paranoid with them about not responding, and I bug them way too much to the point where I know I would definitely be annoyed if I was them. Also they're not very supportive (probably the opposite) but it's not their fault -- they're just causal online friends that shouldn't have to cater to my current host of mental problems.  I'm totally alone. My family and college friends live 4 hours away. I have pretty bad social anxiety and I'm terrified of every new social interaction I have. I work 9 hours and come home to my empty apartment and watch netflix to escape my own life, every day. I sometimes hear from my college friends about all of the fun they're still having together and it honestly brings me to tears that I have such a pathetic lonely life now. I've never been able to have a ""normal"" social life -- it takes me forever to make close friends, and then even at my best I only have a handful of good friends at a time. I don't enjoy going out every weekend or the other obvious ways of making friends, and that wouldn't work now anyway since I would NEVER go alone and I don't have a single person that I could ask to go with me.   When I was a freshman in college I had this same problem -- absolutely zero friends and living in a totally different city. It was the worst depression I've ever been through. I had dozens and dozens of online friends at the time (now we've all lost touch and moved on from the RPG we were playing) that helped ease the loneliness, and I eventually joined a student club and finally made friends after like a year of going. There's not really anything I can ""join"" like that in a non-college town... I've been applying for a few volunteering things, they haven't started but I'm doubtful that it will be a good way to meet people.   I honestly just need ONE person to talk to. Anyone. I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm not a complete weirdo or anything and I know I can have meaningful friendships (just 90% of them have been online, and now I can't even seem to make any fucking online friends either), but I live the loneliest life of anyone I've ever known or heard of. I've never been serious about suicide, but recently that's changed and it's becoming something I could actually picture myself doing. I'm a long way from that but at this point I don't see anything getting better and I practically cry myself to sleep some days and have to hide emotional breakdowns at work after eating lunch alone.

When they are gone, I’m going to be all by myself.   I’ve been so lonely lately too. Just wanting someone to care about me. I had it and fucked it all up at the beginning of the year, and I just regret it all the time. I drink by myself a lot at night to deal with the loneliness, but it makes it worse.  This summer has already just been shitty, but at least my friends are around. It’s like fall is just a ticking time bomb at this point. No matter how hard I try to talk to someone new it never goes my way and I’m always left on read or stood up on plans.  The other night, I got drunk and did something I’ve never done before, and that was cut myself. Honestly, I feel like I did it to see if I could, and how it would make me feel. I guess I still don’t know how it does, but I was disappointed in myself I let it get so far.  I don’t know.

Okay so I'm doing a really shitty job of keeping up with this journal. So Sam came and went. Not before I went to a wedding and got drunk and told her parents that I was in love with her . Yea.. umm.. I'm gay. I then told her that I thought moving to Oregon was a bad bad idea. Not because I was in love with her but because moving to a city for a boy that you're in love with but has no interest in you. Not such a good idea. so anyways that made things all fucked up and she left and we weren't on the best terms  besides that the roommate thing just kind of fell apart. I didn't get the apartment across from shaye because of credit issues. So now I'm going to just move into her place. We'll see how that turns out... If we kill each other or not. I'm not on the lease so if it sucks I can just move out  there are a few boys that are into me. However I don't think that my soul really wants to be with anyone right now. I have something wrong with my heart  I'm doing blood work on Monday to figure out what's going on. And I took last week off for no reason at all. So I guess a lot has happened in the last 15 days.

"I've realized that I made a big mistake by starting this blog. It serves no purpose to put feelings out for public view, so I've deleted the entries from the last six months. I was going to explain some things, but thought better of it. I think a small part of my old self has awakened again. I'm a bit ashamed of all the whining I've done here. I'm embarrassed that I've sought out people in my life for emotional support when I should have dealt with things privately, on my own. When I lost my mind to grief, I forgot everything that I knew. As the old adage goes: you come into this world alone, you live alone, you die alone. You solve your problems alone, needs to be added. The intense pain of grief can warp your mind, impair your judgment and make you do foolish things that you will later regret. I'm sorry if I've upset anyone, but my intention was simply an attempt at self-help, not to change the world. I was simply searching for a way to try to deal with and escape from this pain. I've always appreciated the supportive comments left by people and I thought I had expressed that before. I never thought anyone had an expectation that I would contact them or would even really want me to contact them. I am after all, a stranger to those who have read my words. I was getting to the point where I was starting to  consider emailing some of the people who have posted comments, just to thank them, but now I think that it's better that I don't. This is the old, public version of me writing to day.  I've pushed most of the real, troubled me back down into a box for a little while. I've resolved only to let her out when I'm alone. In this blog, I did dwell on many of the same things again and again, but I was surprised that I could actually find some release by repeatedly talking about the same thing.

"Fuck Everything &amp; Everyone I decided to make a different account for this, because I need to get all of this off my chest. I hate myself and I hate my life. I feel trapped at an absolute dead end in my life, and I'm not even in my twenties yet. I might as well be, considering everything I have to do.  I turned 17 a few months ago, and things have only gotten worse. My parents are completely delusional and can't grasp the fact that thet cause suffering for their own benefit. They would punch you in the face and find any excuse in the book to give a reason behind what they did, even if there wasn't one.  My mom is an asshole, to put it nicely. She's very controlling. I've called and made my own therapy appointments only to find out she cancelled them, resulting in me having to find a different therapist AND doctor twice because they wouldn't take me because of canceling so many times, and I still haven't found either, so no therapy or medication. I have next to no friends because of how she is, coupled with my inability to speak without getting anxiety.   My dad is a lazy dirtbag who fights with me constantly for no reason other than he hates me. He hates how liberal I am, he hates the people I like, whatever I like he probably hates. He sits in front of a TV all day watching shit, he bitches about anything he can, yet does absolutely nothing to fix the issue that he's the main cause of. No clean dishes? I'm in the wrong even though he doesn't rinse his or even bring them to the sink. Pills went missing? He takes more than he's supposed to and forgets and goes into a rage. So on and so forth.  I honestly don't look forward to waking up anymore. I can only find peace at night and then I usually get less sleep than I should. Of course I'm 'lazy' for sleeping in. More gets done quicker in less time when I get up than the whole time they've been up.  I hate this stupid town and I hate my life. It feels like I'm destined for absolute failure. School puts a heavy amount of pressure on me too. I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up, that would be ideal honestly.  The list of things that make me happy and want to live grows shorter every day, and I'm so, so lost on what to do anymore. I feel so uncomfortable and just... wrong.

"I think I'm having a nervous breakdown I've struggled off and on for about 10 years with anxiety and depression. The latter half has been mostly on. Recently my psychiatrist changed my medication from Zoloft to Effexor because the Zoloft had pretty much plateaued and then started working less. I don't think the Effexor is having a very good effect on me. My depression has been worse than ever. On top of that I found out that my dog has bone cancer and likely won't live more than 8-12 months. She's only 6 and she has been my entire world since I adopted her and she has helped me through a lot of difficult times. Because of these things my moods have been very bad, and I had to leave work a few days ago and I haven't been back since, and I'm pretty sure they're going to fire me because I'm still new. Although the job was adding to my stress because they failed to tell me that we would be working mandatory overtime EVERY SINGLE DAY. I don't have much of a support system. My mom is pissed at me about work, and I'm living with my grandfather who just doesn't get it. I don't really have much in the way of friends which is I guess why I'm ranting on Reddit looking for some kind of support. I don't really know what to do.

"I am  61 and for almost two years have been dealing with anxiety. It is strange the way of hitting and I would like to know from some of you experts if it is typical GAD.  For almost two years I have been awakened almost every day at about 5:30 out of sound sleep with this feeling of anxiety. At first it hit my spine, now my stomach. If I take a xanax it will dissipate and not bother me much until later in the day. Again, no matter what I am doing I can feel it start to build, take a xanax and go on with life. By late afternoon it is gone and doesn't return until the next day.  During this period my thyroid has been going haywire, probably from four surgeries in four years, the last being two months ago...a total knee repacement.. About sox weels before this surgery, after changing my thyroid meds a bit, the anxiety had left me. I was fine through the operation and then about three weeks after, it was back!  Before the operation I was beginning to get some real bouts of rolling depression but they are gone for now ... just anxiety. The thing that I question is that it is the same no matter what is or has happened in my life for the day. I can have a great, relaxed day or a hectic, chaotic day and the next day will be exactly the same. My environment doesn't seem to affect it.

"I'm new and my message doesn't seem to fit anywhere else. I have been suffering from depression since I was 15 (now 21) but I've only recently thought of it as 'depression' as I used to think it was just me and all my feelings were real. It started with wanting to end up in hospital - get hit by a car etc. I felt useless and boring and unwanted by my family or anyone. Felt like I was jus in the way wherever I went. I felt empty and the only escape I ever had was fantasizing about the day I die - that release that I would feel from everything. So I used to write suicide notes and when I could read them without crying then I would deem myself ready. Or I would think that if I could starve myself for a week then I would be ready. (This one I couldn't do) finally it all got too much. In my head, my parents were so disappointed in me that they would be better off without me and to my sisters I was too annoying that they wouldn't miss me. Up until now I had jus cut myself discreetly. So I took 80 paracetamol (not knowing then that they can't actually kill you) and jus sat around waiting - half excited half scared. Nothing happened for ages and I started to get more scared - what would my parents think? Would they cope? Would they blame themselves? So I threw up and called an ambulance myself. I will never get over how hurt they were by what I had done and so will never do that again. But I still think bout it. When ever things get too hard. I think how can I make it look like an accident as I know they could handle that much better than suicide. I have been on antidepressants for 8 months now. For the 3rd time. But it seems that they are just putting a 'blanket' over how I'm feeling and I'm not addressing the real issues; not that I know what they are. I can't get motivated to study, go to class, go out, anything. I don't care. I don't see the point in living a miserable life and what if there is no point? what if our worlds are all the creation of our minds and once our minds are dead, so is our world so there's no one left hurting once were gone? What is the point to a miserable life when it could all be ended now? I don't think suicide is the right way to go - I believe only god, whatever you conceive him to be (if anything) should have the only power over life and death, but why does he take some people and not others? (More specifically, me?) I pray that he will take me next - give me the cancer meant for someone who loves life - but as yet has been to no avail. But if all we are to do is to be alive then die, why can I not decide to take my death into my own hands, like so many people do what they want with their lives? Of course, there's always the factor of limbo - do people who commit suicide really end up in limbo? I suppose what scares me even more is that - going through the pain and anguish of suicide just to end up in limbo - with just your mind, thinking away for ever.... are my feelings wrong? Is it a chemical reaction in my brain? Or do I just not belong in this life? So confused! And just don't see the point in being here - anyone have the answers I'm looking for?

"Crashing In Sorry this is long.  I've been depressed since I was 15. First signs were at age 4.  I found pot and stayed high for 8 years. Clean and sober for 30 years, I never stopped having suicidal thoughts despite medication. So I tried to bury the pain in relationships, which didn't work either. I've been married three times in recovery.  I had a daughter who I love very much, and we used to be very close.  She became a reason to live.  Then 4 years ago she didn't want to live with me 1/2 time any more. She became argumentative and we fought a lot.   Last year I found out she was accusing me of sexual abuse, with help from her mom ( first wife) and therapist, which is not true. The therapist never reported the abuse, and told daughter I have NPD, which also is not true.  So I got a guardian ad litem to investigate and found my daughter was suicidal, claiming PTSD because of the alleged molestation. The lawyer never helped my daughter, sparking a slide into deeper depression. My wife and parents didn't do much to try to help.  They got angry when I begged them to step in. Suidical ideation and inappropriate attention-getting threats became an actual plan, and a way to do it without leaving the stain of suicide.  Then at work I made a $5 billion discovery that is extremely disruptive in the industry I work in. My quarter million dollar program found out millions are being spent on the wrong strategy. And 1/2 my team works on the other strategy at the same time as they are helping me, so they are taking steps to undermine the findings. Lately they gave up trying to block the discovery, and the fact that we can literally feed more people with no more land used for farming, by raising more animals (naturally) with the same amount of feed. I'm getting invited to speak globally about the discovery. The suicidal thoughts deepen, knowing the disruption to status quo is only beginning.  Just before Christmas my third wife moved out, and I spent Christmas alone because my parents were sick. Last night she told my mom she intends to get a divorce.   The medicine isn't working. The AA old timers are saying I'm depressed because I'm not working the steps correctly. I'm going to 2-3 meetings a day, most days.  In two days I'm shutting down the case I opened to try to get help for my daughter.   I can hardly work, because I can't complete thoughts very well any more, being so depressed.  I've been complaining about feeling depressed and suicidal, because it's true, and it became a way to relate to the world, which makes people leave. The spiral is getting tighter, and it feels like a black hole is pulling me in. I can't imagine facing another divorce feeling this low.  Mom said to get a roast beef out of the freezer and cook it with some potatoes and carrots and stop thinking about negative things. I went to Landmark and they say this is all just a story, and part of a racket I created to avoid responsibility. They say I can create something different by changing my story.  I've tried a rainbow of medicine, and tomorrow I increase Latuda from 20 mg to 40, and keep the trintellex at 20, per MD.   I can't do anything now because third wife will get 1/2, and parents are too old to deal with my belongings. My thoughts turn to seeing if I can find someone else who will love me anyway, or giving up. I want to give up but not really.  I really want to live, but I can't see any hope. And I can't stand the thought of being alone.   Any help, hope or ideas would be appreciated.

"I lost my job, i'm in the worst place i have ever been, and nothing makes sense or feels fair. I have worked at the same place for nearly three years. It's an entry level retail job, but i haven't ever had anything else, so it was really the only thing that made me feel validated. Recently, for the fifth time i got passed up for a promotion, but this time marked the end. The girl who got promoted over me is one of my best friends in the world. She is absolutely amazing, and i am so happy for her, but it was the hardest to accept. She started about a year ago, and i helped train her and build her up. Fairly quickly, we became the face of the job that we did. She was my partner in everything, and i feel like i would be there for the things she couldn't do, and she would be there for the things i couldn't do. Seeing her success is the most proud i have ever been, but it's made me the most miserable. I basically found out that after busting my ass for over two years, my partner was going to be my boss. I hate that. I lost the person that was my rock in the things that i did. I don't want to work under her, i wanted to be there with her. She told me when it happened out of respect for me, and i turned in my resignation the next day. Now the only thing that made me feel validated and gave me security is gone, and i don't know what to do.   My friend understood everything of course. More than just being my partner in work, she was the only person who could tell when things got really bad for me. When i hide how miserable i am, she's the first person to notice, and the only person who understands and will tell me what i need to hear. If there is any upside to all of this, it's that at least i still have my friend. In my overthinking and fear, i guess i was afraid this would change things. I learned pretty fast how much care and respect she holds for me, and i don't think anything will change that. I hope not.  This job was beating me down. I trained a lot of our best staff, and i had a lot of associate come to me before management, feeling like i was more of a leader to them than our actual leadership was. We lost a lot of people due to burnout and frustration with management, but i know that i always cared about the people i got to train and help, and took a lot of pride in their success. Even after getting underpaid, undervalued, and shafted at every turn, i always stayed because i cared about the people i worked with and i wouldn't give up on them. One would think that leaving a shit situation would make me happy, but it just doesn't. Despite my 2+ years retail and leadership experience, it's been hard to find another job. Most people offer me less money than i made before (not much) and basically completely ignore any qualifications i actually have.   I am in school. I finish community college this year and will move to a four year school assuming i can as my performance isn't amazing. I I want to pursue grad school to gain qualifications as an industrial/org psychologist, but everything seems so far away. I feel like with being a Psych major i'm just going to end up equally as useless with a four year degree, and even if grad school does work out, that's overall another four years from now. I have to pay bills, and i hate feeling so useless.   I'm not going to starve and die or anything. My family has money, and has offered to help me pay bills if i can't find a job, but that just makes things worse in a way. I moved away from home because i wanted to be my own person. It has been three years and i haven't had to ask for help from anybody. I hate the thought that i will have to rely on these people who have given me everything to give me more. It isn't their fault that i'm a fuck up.  A man said to the universe:   “Sir, I exist!”  “However,” replied the universe,   “The fact has not created in me  A sense of obligation.”    - Stephen Crane  I know that life isn't fair. I know nobody owes me anything, but i hate that it seems like i always end up last. My friend gets to be happy, my other friend practically runs the store now (but not enough to help, because the SM makes all the decisions and she's shitty), but i have the least and i get the least. My staff and coworkers get people to hang out with. Everyone gets to go home to someone that loves them when they fail and gets comfort from that. I don't get that. I am alone, and i have always been. The joy i get is from making other people happy because i can't make myself happy. I want to make these people never have to feel how i do. It's just so fucking unfair that things just seem to work out better for everyone else. I don't know what to do, i don't know where to go, and i don't know how to be happy.  This is the worst it has been. Usually i go home for a bit to take my mind off things, or can occupy my time with videos games or something to take my mind off things. Nothing is fun right now. Not turning to alcohol is hard. I really feel like things will get better but..... how fucking long does it take?

It just frustrates me so much, and continues the perpetual cycle of ""well if I can't make myself better through such simple actions I must be even more of a failure than I realised"".

I also don't need to lose weight and being overweight is not the reason I am depressed (because I'm not overweight).

"Hi folks, I've only discovered this topic after making several previous posts :) I am from a traditional Asian culture, but now half-westernized on migration to Australia since age 6. I've had a long history that stems right to my parents' histories before I was born. To cut it very short, my father has schizoid/schizotypal/socially withdrawn personality traits, and my mother has dependent traits, so they basically had a loveless marriage (common in my culture). There is a long history of parental quarrelling and physical abuse on my mother before and after I was born, some of which I heard as a child to early teens. I was seldom exposed socially growing up, and I had few school friends. I was also 'born' a quiet person, but this and lack of socializing made me a withdrawn kid. When I was about 4, I believe I experienced one psychotic episode (I 'saw' 2 caped 'grim reapers' at that time), since which I have no further experiences. I experienced a few bouts of depression during secondary school, for which I didn't seek help because of my shyness and parental/cultural stigma that 'depression does not exist' (thankfully my family has ditched that attitude now). During that time, I had many suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide maybe 3 times but didn't tell anyone about it. A very terrible incident also happened towards the end of high school - one night, I physically assaulted my father while he was quarrelling with mom, and he was hospitalized. I got charged with assault, but no conviction was recorded after I did psychotherapy for anger control - that was also the only therapeutic contact with psychological/psychiatric services I had until very recently. That incident, although I felt numb through that time, has been scarred into my memory - I can still recall the events, and my conscience is still wrecked over it, though I continue to fight it and let it go. At school, I was a top-end academic achiever in science and math. I was named dux of the school on graduation. Upon entering university, my depression became worse mainly because of increased social isolation. I was still shy and withdrawn, I lost contact with my high school friends (they also saw me as 'weird', but I was also a bit narcissistic towards them at some times - I think it was an unconscious aggressive reaction towards them), and failed to make any lasting friendship with university peers. One year into university, I started studying Medicine, which I am still doing at the moment. However I felt that course had over time did not improve me, though I did make few friends. I still felt unable to socialize with peers, even though I was in constant contact with them through many lectures and tutorials. Even though I was an average performer, I felt I struggled heavily through the years with study. Late last year, my depression hit a new low - my parents had another quarrel, and I was studying psychiatry which forced me to realize the extensiveness of my past and current problems. It was another awful time - I lost a lot of self-confidence/esteem, became more withdrawn. I ended up failing my first practical exam but still passed given my past satisfactory academic record - the faculty put it down to lack of practice, but the truth is because of what I experienced leading up to the exam. In this year however my depressive bouts became much worse - my few friends had deferred, and I was left with no friends, despite still knowing the others 'by name'. My experience during this year was largely negative - I felt harassed by teaching doctors, peers, being looked at as a 'weirdo' and excluded from conversations and their social outings (whether this was a valid view, I'm finding out now by resocializing with them - my main aim at the moment). Over the last 2 months I had about 5 more depressive episodes, and attempted suicide 3 times, again nobody knew about them. It became a frantic situation - I approached the faculty dean for help, but he only recommended me a psychiatrist, who he was supposed to contact before I contacted him. However that psychiatrist wasn't notified, and I felt very angry about it and thought that nobody was out there to help me. In retrospect, my view was unrealistic - help only exists on a professional level, something I knew long before but did not acknowledge at that time, making me upset. My depression faded away a few days later. A few nights ago, I had a short dispute with mom, got upset and this eventually led to me joining this forum after a quick search on the net. Why am I writing this intro? Several reasons. I want to tell my story to others, and feel this is a stepping stone to encourage myself. I also want others not yet aware that depression can affect ANYONE, even the best of us, even those involved in the medical profession (up to 30% of junior doctors suffer from depression, and up to 10% have attempted/committed suicide). I want to improve my own situation - most of all, learning to deal with feelings of sadness and negatively that has crippled me mentally in the past, and my lack of sociability which doesn't help my situation. I know deep inside I am capable of pulling through, of being able to live a normal healthy life because I am aware of my problems and have the power to deal with them. Finally, although I'm still a student, I believe my position is privileged and that I should use what knowledge I have learnt to help others as best as I can, something I will be bound to by Hippocratic Oath on finishing school. I am grateful that such a forum exists for others and me to express our thoughts, experiences and feelings, and that there are people out there who devote themselves for such causes.

"it don't get no better than this Last night was a success. I was in truly rare form. My last non-fuzzy memory is of chugging beers at a friend's around 10:30, but highlights of the night include: making out with two of my girl friends; flashing one of my more reserved friends (reaction: ""Did she just flash me??""); waking up this morning with a stranger's cell phone on my desk (a peek through the phone book, and I was pretty sure he's not a law student), but thankfully no owner of the cell phone in my bed; doing way too many shots when, after being asked if I wanted to do shots, I responded, ""I really shouldn't do whiskey shots... Bring me the tequila!"" and apparently a solid effort at drunk dialing, if the outgoing call log on my cell is any indication. We had a really fun night, but then getting shitty with friends is always a good time. I think I was still drunk when I went to Civ Pro this morning, hmm. The bar we went to is dead on Thursday nights (though really packed on Friday and Saturday nights). It was nice, though -- we had the bar to ourselves. About 40 people showed up, and after talking to us for awhile, the owner said he'd give us drink specials on Thursday nights if we came back. He even comped a lot of our drinks, which was cool. We'll definitely be back. I liked this place already, but this is true incentive. A couple people are out tonight, but I lost my steam after Happy Hour.

"I've basically been living a lie for the last year.  My depression / social anxiety has become so crippling that I'm scared to work outside of the home, but I told my parents that I was working anyway, because I didn't want them to know how bad it was.  I wasn't taking money from them or anything (I don't live with my parents, and my husband has a great job and I don't technically HAVE to work)  but now that I've come clean about it my mother says she feels ""manipulated.""  I guess I can see why, and I do feel really bad about lying to them.  I suppose that their forgiveness will just take time.  But the thing is, I can't tell any of them HOW BAD THIS REALLY IS, including my husband.  It's to the point now where I'm even afraid to see a doctor.  I'm sure there isn't some magic formula for getting past actually having to admit that you have a really serious problem,  but I was just wondering how some of you were able to get past that feeling of embarrassment and shame that keeps you from getting help, and telling the people you love the truth.   Every day is getting harder and harder, especially now that my family knows I've been lying.  I really thought telling them would make everything a little easier (lying = instant paranoia!), but now I can't stop thinking about how I've ruined my relationships with them forever, and I'm even more hopeless than I was before.

"I have just now realized now, after 24+ years of experiencing it, that what I've suffered from is depression. Soon after that, I spoke to my dad about it, and learned he'd been on AD's for over 10 years now, and he said he probably could have used them from the time he was about 15 years old on. He also said my paternal grandmother's side of the family was all just like us (my dad and I are almost carbon copies of each other, except he's always seemed much more ""perfect"" to me than I am.  ) He also said my oldest half brother is also on AD's. I also talked to my oldest daughter (who's 21 year-old), and she said she's been on AD's a few times too. I can say also that I learned many years after his death that my maternal grandfather experienced severe depression before I was born. He had shock therapy multiple times it seems...but I don't know if his problems were entirely from the extreme horrors he experienced in WWII, or a combination of that plus other problems. When I knew him he was always a sweet loving, rather quiet, man (and my favorite person in the world other than my dad.) My dad said he never associated my problems with depression (of course, neither did I), but now it all clicks. I wish I'd known all this when I was younger, that depression hadn't had the stigma it had back in the 1970s & 80s, and that I could have gotten treatment back then. Of course, if I had, I wouldn't have the same life I have now, so I guess I can't complain about that (and honestly wouldn't change a thing...I wouldn't risk losing my kids or what I've accomplished, no matter how crooked and difficult the path as been). But I will definitely watch my young kids now for signs of depression (especially my 4 year-old daughter, since she seems to have a similar personality to my dad and I). If I see it, they will get the treatment they need immediately!

"I began to openly discuss my depression to my friends. It was very painful to discuss but I think it's a step in the right direction. Up to now, I have never discussed my depression with anyone besides my husband and my therapist. I have slight PTSD from when I was kid and a teacher had been ""concerned"" for me by some disturbing behavior. I felt even more misunderstood and felt so much anguish that I became really good at disguising my depression. I hid it under a fake, likable, version of myself because I wanted to fit in and feel like I belong.  Currently, my closest friends are my coworkers but they the most judgmental people I've known. We became close by commiserating together at work. Fast forward a few years, I am finally starting to feel better after seeking help for my depression. I've been seeing a therapist for over a year, began taking antidepressants two months ago, and have been taking cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. As I begin to feel better, I also feel more miserable hanging out with my friends.  I decided to be more open with the people around me about my depression. I revealed it today for the first time with one of my closest friends. It was incredibly scary for me... I haven't felt this vulnerable in a long time. My friends typically see me as a guarded person with a hard exterior, but I felt tears welling in my eyes. He was very surprised to hear, but I'm not the first person he knows with depression so it was reassuring to know he didn't think I was some sort of freak. He also commended me for taking steps in getting better and encouraged me to continue talking about it. It was a positive experience overall.  I then decided to tell another friend later in the day because I was feeling good after the discussion I had earlier. It went a little differently though... His first question was, ""what do you have to be depressed about?!"" which instantly flooded my mind with negative feelings of remorse. I tried my best to keep calm and answer his questions honestly. I explained that it's not any thing or anyone that is making me *feel* depressed. It's a mental condition I have which causes me to be in a persistent state of sadness and worthlessness. He asked me if I understand where Eric is coming from (his bipolar nephew that he sometimes mentions), and I said yes. He then seemed to become more curious and asked me many questions about what it's like.   In the end, I feel like I educated him on depression and hopefully helped debunk his belief that depression is just a feeling that people should be able to snap out of. I honestly don't think I could have these conversations if I was in the state I was even a month ago. Even today, I felt myself slipping into the familiar downward spiral. I don't know what kept me composed today, but I'm so proud of myself for making it through the conversation without snapping or becoming defensive. Perhaps if I had these conversations in reverse order, it could've been a completely different experience.  I hope this inspires others to talk about it, seek help and be open to receiving it. It was quite uncomfortable but I am happy to create an opening for other people to understand what we are going through.

"I went to Lauren's place last night with Lee and watched Takashi Miike's Audition with them and Loro's boyfriend Thomas. It was great. Especially for a Friday the 13th. I can't wait to see Ichi the Killer with them. Oh, and Visitor Q! I don't think I've ever known anyone who can sit through his movies and enjoy them with me, rather than be grossed out and run away. Hah! Yay! Hurray for sick fuckers! I panicked at work just before 5:00pm on Friday and ended up calling my doctor to schedule an appointment so that I could get back onto my medication. I thought I would be fine without it. After all, it's been about a month now. My eyes water at the mere mentioning of something upsetting and I've been getting frustrated really easily. Whether I like it or not, I'm going to need to stay on it. Hopefully not forever.

"What’s the point of coming up if you’re gonna go down? I moved to a new city with the love of my life after 5 years of loving him. I was ready to propose, I looked at rings, I called jewelers. I debated getting a ring of meteorite, you know? He’s super nerdy, super cute. Science geek and all. I’d like to think every guy buying rings thinks about the meteorite ring haha.  Then he tells me that he feels like a she. I loved her no matter what. I told her I still loved her and that she’s going to be one of the most beautiful girls ever. I still planned to propose. I loved her more that she’s her true self.  Then my heart gets broken. She tells me that she can’t see a future with me together. She tells me that she’s only interested in women. There wasn’t much for me to do but respect her true feelings. I couldn’t force her to love me. For a few weeks I lost my best-friend and my future.   We still lived together, music helped, weed helped. I made friends. I tried to be happy, and for a little I think I really was okay. But it was so stormy, one tip of the scale and I was back to being broken.   Then I find out that she’s seeing other guys. My heart was gone, the only feeling is that feeling when your heart drops to your stomach. It’s a little harder to swallow, did life get harder? Did she make it easier? I don’t know. I wasn’t good enough for her. She says otherwise. I know she means the best for me with her heart but man, did it hurt the same.  I ask her to give me time, as a roommate, as a past lover, give me time to heal before you see someone. Please, just give me some time to heal.   But she couldn’t wait. I don’t blame her, she’s discovering herself. She’s beautiful. I never had a chance. There are better men for her. I’m broken, the pieces stomped on.   I try. I go to work. I exercise. I eat healthy. I tell myself “improve for yourself and no one else”. It’s a lie.  Life seems to drag on, I try to smile, I miss my best friend. I try to act like everything’s alright to her. She can’t be seeing me like this, it hurts her too.  I meet a guy. He’s cute, a little simple, but cute. We start to hang out, workout together even. He takes me to some of the most beautiful places, I try to swallow my doubt and bring my heart back. Somedays, I could swallow just fine around him.   When I was sure I was ready, I told him. It was too late. I took too long.  I was just dead. I made plans, wrote good bye letters, planned that my little siblings would get what money I had left. I know it’s selfish, I know it can get better. I even tried to find a program that sends emails at a certain time so everyone could get a good nights sleep before they received my letter.   I couldn’t do it. I stood on the edge of a bridge, the edge of a cliff, wore my favorite clothes. Listened to my favorite songs. Every time I couldn’t do it. You never think of it as someone being brave. But I was scared, I couldn’t imagine how anyone took that step off, pulled the trigger, kicked the chair. They had to be brave.  And now, I’m back.

"I willingly admit that I am a sufferer of depression. But in my case, I think the problem was education more than anything. I recognize that I have been depressed pretty much from as far back as I can remember. I'm not sure where I got the misinformation but I spent most of my life believing that it was just me, just life, you know, the thinking that some people were lucky and happy and I just wasn't. I'm 34 now so it is a wonder that I made it to this point, considering the statistics. I think that I tried to destroy myself in other ways like smoking and minor drugs and not taking care of myself. Basically I was waiting for things to either get better or finish falling apart. About a year ago, my new doctor recognized the symptoms in me and offered me help in the form of Zoloft and some counseling which changed my life. The problem then became that I changed jobs and lost my insurance with no hope of COBRA so I actually went of the drug cold turkey (highly not recommended, believe me) and am now back where I started.

"Hello, I'm new here. I'm 36 and have had depression since the age of 9. I'm supposed to take Lexapro every day, but often I forget. Memory / concentration is poor, one of the areas of the brain that depression screws with, the others being sleep, appetite, and libido.  Here's my thing ... I'm so gosh darn afraid to do anything! It's hard at times to even face my job, I call in sick and stay in pajamas all day. I do get out of bed, but I won't bathe or brush teeth. Isn't that gross! I did this on Monday and Tuesday this week.  I'm in school at night, it's a tele course class in geology. Last Friday we had an exam, and I didn't show up for it because I didn't do any reading for it. Now it's almost Wednesday, and I still haven't touched the reading. We can make up the exam no later than 1 week after the exam date, so I have two days to cover several chapters. Thing is, I'm SCARED CRAPLESS to even start!!! It's like I've got ""freeze - itis"" and I can't seem to study! I've been doing other things, like cleaning and laundry and doing Immigration research (trying to bring my Egyptian fiance here to the States), but haven't touched the geology, even though that's been #1 on my mind for two weeks. Even this past weekend, I had no plans (as usual!) and didn't crack open even one page.  I fear failure, and it's so hard to ""let go and let God"". I know in my head to give this fear to God, but I don't really know what that specifically means. In the meantime, I'm miserable and failing my geology class. Already I dropped the music class (originally I had two), since I was failing that royally.  Can anyone relate? How do any of you summon up the courage to face your fears?

"Hello all. My name is Daniel I'm 23 and going to school in Bowling Green, Ohio. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, ADD, and depression. I've tried various medicines for my ADD and the last one I was on was Effexor XR, usually used to treat depression but can be used for adult ADD, I was on it for a year or two and kept increasing the dosage b/c I wasn't seeing enough results. The medicine dosage got too high and I had a break down during the summer of 05. To vent I would cut myself and eventually attempted suicide in a Kroger parking lot. I went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed medicines, but I've grown tired of using medicines; I had a seizure while on a drug for acne. I refused to take the medicines and have been struggling with killing myself every day. I don't really like going into public due to my social anxiety and tend to turn to computer games to escape reality. I drink more caffeine than is healthy, don't sleep at night, and have fluctuations in eating. I never think I am good at anything, I built a computer last night which kind of made me feel good about myself, but that's not enough. I've stopped going to class because I don't think I'm good enough and haven't told anyone. I'm pretty much a wreck right now and am in the process of going to the counseling center that my school offers. I don't know how much longer I can hold out before I try something else. I am struggling to even be happy around my friends, family and girl friend. They all know I think about it every day, but never say anything. It's probably because I hide my feelings and lie to them about it. I don't want to even keep going to school it feels so pointless. My girl friend wants to get married I don't even want to think about it. I don't want to get married and am too gutless to tell her. I have feelings of breaking up with her but once again I'm to scared and gutless to say anything.

"What a great topic!! The news always makes me cry - and I end up turning it off shortly after I start watching it - why do I punish myself? My parents know that I have learned to not watch the news because of the negative effect it has on me, so if something really important is going on, they let me know. My Aunt suffers from chronic depression and delusion, and I've had numerous conversations with her on how to handle the depression because she's tried so many different things, even going to Mexico to see a Shaman. Her top 3 suggestions (and I really go by them as much as I possibly can) are: 1) Get proper sleep - this is probably the most paramount point; 2) get proper nutrition; and 3) don't watch the news. The one thing that I absolutely cannot tolerate is sad news about animals - that really sends me. When I'm flipping thru channels and happen upon Animal Planet and the Animal Police are busting people because of their cruelty - I have to turn it immediately. I think I'm delusional too in that I choose not to watch the news, animal stories, anything really unpleasant - I guess I try to live in my little world without negativity or sadness. I know that it isn't very mature or adult, but this is my coping mechanism. I do find that when I hear or see anything sad or awful that my negativity really gets into gear, and then I'm completely negative for awhile. Driving is also incredibly difficult because I commute into Washington D.C. from the suburbs and traffic is awful. I become so negative about the other drivers around me that I end up hating myself over my thoughts about them! They, of course, drive too slow and are idiots. I need to find a job close to home! I too have sometimes felt that the human race needs to think about not populating the world anymore. I wouldn't want to raise a small child in this environment any more! I'm glad my son is in college and he's the only one that I could have. But then again, I can't wait until my sister or brother has kids so that I can be with them and spoil them rotten. Crazy isn't it? I have taken others suggestions in this thread and have tried to make myself think positively the last 2 days. It's difficult but possible! I notice that my mood has brightened somewhat too.

"I am in a state of emptiness. Recently, I was in a relationship with someone who didn't love me, but I loved them intensely. I had hoped eventually she would turn around, but for that time, I found deep meaning in her. Now it's over, and she doesn't seem to care. Meanwhile, I am in hell. It's like the past four years of my life were just a dream. I feel humiliated, used and defeated. I feel like I have nothing. I lost my job, stopped going to school, and was forced to move back in with my parents. I feel like a total failure and completely worthless. I feel like I am being punished by God, and there is no way out. Even in my dreams I can't escape the pain. I can't see the good in anything anymore. Everywhere, I see pain and suffering, with no hope. Even when I meet incredible people who am in awe of, I feel almost envious, knowing that I am a worthless, useless nothing in the presence of angels. I still have some friends, but have grown distant from them. Seeing their success, no matter how minute, just reminds me of my worthlessness. I have nothing to offer the world. I am without purpose.  Even when I have enough things to distract me, my ex is still in my dreams or nightmares every night. Before I met her, I got my life on track, was kicking ass in school, and headed for something. I know I can't blame her, but I just feel so stupid for getting caught up in her drama for no reason. What a waste.  I don't know. I've been reflecting on my life a lot. I'm 27 and have nothing to show for it. I feel like I have to make drastic changes. Liquor and drugs are not doing me any good. I don't know what the hell I want anymore. I'm so lost, sometimes I don't even know if I'm really alive.  I feel like right now, I have to settle for mediocrity and hope for simple low - stress job that pays the bills, but I don't have any source of joy or anything really to look forward too.  I've pinpointed that the major source for depression and life problems as been my self-hatred. It manifests itself in many forms, including obsessive feelings of inadequacy and incompetence, paranoia, being overly - sensitive to criticism, feeling worthless, hopeless, and giving up too easy because of those feelings.  Where did all this self - hatred come from? I don't want to blame my parents at my age, but I know that how they treated me when I was younger affected me and it still lingers in my psyche. They always employed the shame approach to parenting. Anytime something happened, my father would curse at me, and lecture me on how worthless I was. He would glare at me, and I just had to sit there and listen. Sometimes I would start crying, and then he would yell at me for crying, and say shit like ""look at you, you're not even ashamed."" Shame was apparently a virtue. My mother once told me when I was 8 that she wanted to have a third child, but because I was such a disappointment, she decided against it. They hit me frequently, with a bamboo stick. I remember they would constantly compare me to their friend's children, praising them and ask me why I couldn't be more like them.  So all this happened, but I can't change the past. I don't want to dwell and blame my parents for their mistakes, no one is a perfect parent. I just want to get over these feelings of self - hatred and get my life in order. I've identified the source of my depression, but haven't been able to change all those feelings and thought-processes that have been ingrained in me since early childhood. Does anyone have any advice on how to overcome these feelings, and gain a sense of confidence and direction back?

"I'm 25 years old single black mother and I've been struggling with depression ever since I was a small girl. Throughout the course of my life I have had a lot of share of ups and downs: parents divorced in 1985, father was on drugs, domestic abuse, severe teasing, idiotic boyfriends and the list goes on. If there were problems in the home, you dealt with it at home and kept your mouth shut tight. There is no such thing as a black woman being depressed. Black women MUST keep this aura of being strong, independent, swallow your tears, raise your children, take the blows that life throws at you and keep moving with the beat. If you didn't keep moving with the beat, then you will fall through the cracks; everyone sees it and you will be considered as weak and no one will want to deal with you. Everyone around you will let you have it and you will be labeled as an outcast among your fellow black sisters and brothers. I have had a few suicide attempts and my family thought that I was just trying to get sheer childish attention as to say, ""I'm a big baby, pay attention to me."" They took it as a joke and it broke my spirit down to a trillion pieces. I constantly worried what my friends, co-workers, class mates, and lovers would see me as a walking disaster waiting to happen. At the time, I did a good job of ""covering it up"" for a long time. It painfully and slowly came out. I was afraid that if I told some one that I was severely depressed, I would not get the love, support, and care that I needed: family labeled me as ""CRAZY"".

Nausea/heartburn from Wellbutrin I started about a week ago and was having some reflux beforehand but only really when I drank alcohol or had something really acidic. Now I’m avoiding all that and I still have issues everyday. I know heartburn is a side effect but the weird thing is that I take it right in the morning and then at fine all day until the evening while I’m getting ready to go to bed I’m just hit with bad nausea out of no where. I avoid eating before bed as well.   Wondering if anyone else has this experience. I was maybe thinking of moving it to type evening but then I’m worried if there’s some 12 hour delay to it I’m just gunna wake up with the nausea which could be just as bad but at least it won’t effect my sleep.   Or maybe it will just go away with time since I’m still pretty early on idk but it’s really fucking with me right now ,nauseaheartburn wellbutrin started week ago having reflux really drank alcohol really acidic avoiding issue everyday know heartburn effect weird thing right morning fine day evening getting ready bed just hit bad nausea where avoid eating bed well wondering experience maybe thinking moving type evening worried hour delay just gunna wake nausea just bad not effect sleep maybe just away time pretty early idk really fucking right,0.4568386375904083,0.5256224274635315,0.5236935019493103
"Need to talk and I have nobody. Hey all. Just need to talk, really struggling right now and trying to dig out of it. Not really sure what else to do.   Pattern of behaviour:  Wake up in the morning with immediate feelings of depression and loneliness. Acute feelings of being alone in bed, uncomfortable. Become compelled to flip through Bumble, Tinder because I feel a need to try and immediately correct the problem. I never (and I mean never) match. Have to fight urges to immediately abuse addictions like porn and weed. Sometimes do, sometimes don’t. Prepare for work, fight off feelings of sadness about ex-girlfriend and situation it puts me in. Fight the urge to blame her for the failure of the relationship even though I logically know I’m wrong or that’s not fair. She just left to pursue school and had to move on, she didn’t do anything to me. Fight feelings of rejection and feelings of inadequacy in my value to others even though there’s no reason to feel that here.   Walk to work, continue to fight with anger issues re: relationships and validation. Sometimes frustration stems from lack of work success but more often than not it’s physical appearance issues and relationship issues. I get caught in a loop being mad at her and being mad at myself and my capacity to deal with being alone.   Auto-pilot at work. Able to do job easily, so lack of focus is a non-issue. I spend too much time on Facebook and other social media looking for outlets to expand my social network and friends. Find it very difficult to do so without appearing over-anxious or creepy and new opportunities rarely prevent themselves. Sometimes  Imarket business and contact clients/potential clients. Sometimes a boost comes from having success here, but often the lack thereof is equally esteem damaging.   Go home, usually bus. Already tired. Immediately engage addictions, usually beer and weed. Start watching TV or playing games and rarely stop until bed time. I'll leave easy tasks like cleaning dishes, etc for weeks. Continual evasion of solving problems, instead opting to rely on substances to either forget or balance my feelings of sadness. Occasionally I have friends over, but many of them use substances as well or are in similar life situations so finding solace in these encounters is limited. Furthermore, they are my friends of many years and represent a kind of social stagnation.   At night I’m usually in bed by 10, not because I’m out of things to do, but because I’m either drunk or bored.   On weekends I’m lucky if I do anything outside of what I do immediately after work. I rarely feel compelled to do anything. If I get invited to a bar, I end up going and feeling alienated from everyone and ‘out-of-place’. Most of the time, I just feel too tired to join my friends, but I also feel a lack of motivation because I’m sure it’ll just be the same crowd—and it appears their lives keep moving while mine does not.  I am behind on adulthood. I have only recently acquired a driver’s license, I just renewed my glasses prescription and only just started living on my own. I have to get my teeth taken care of and they are a source of stress and physical pain (still have wisdom teeth at 34). I have the habits of a teenager. I smoke copious amounts of weed, I drink daily and I don’t pursue my interests or goals. I know the right course of action most of the time, but I actively ignore it because the amount required to get healthy is just too much. I have spent a great majority of my life single and most of my relationships aside from a few gems have been tumultuous, emotional rollercoasters. More often than not,  Despite all these things I feel undervalued in my society. I think of myself as smart, funny and confident in my skills, but I feel that the rest of the world doesn’t care and doesn’t see those as appealing. I feel like without looks and an academic education, you can only accomplish so much and that people’s standards are so high that competition for a good role in society is unlikely. I feel unable to compete when the above issues prevent me from succeeding. Motivation to do anything is lowered by the lack of acceptance in general, the feeling that I should be acceptable the way I am but am not, and my inability to seem to control that situation. It doesn’t help that on the face of it, most people will tell me that I seem like a “catch”, an incredibly high-value person with lots to offer—except that none of that seems to translate to my life, emotional attachments or stability.  I'm just lost.

"How do you talk about depression to your friends? I'm really ashamed of not necessarily the depression in and of itself but the way that I have acted with it and the way that I have (so far) failed to overcome its clutches.

"Failure to trust ‘’those on my side’’. [possible trigger Warning] I find myself incapable of trusting my spouse. I’ve been with my SO for nearly 15 years, 7 married this year, we have 3 children. Before I hit my mid-teens I’d been through nearly a decade of sexual abuse within the already dysfunctional household I grew up one, with an alcoholic father and a narcissistic mother.  I met my now spouse when I was 17. He had been in a two year relationship with a girl a few years his senior, which left him broken after her infidelity. And I… well I lived day to day, carrying what I could. I’ll never forgot how I coldly and factually told him with a mere two sentences what I had to endure, telling him that if he did chose me, he would be settling for a lifetime shared with a woman with severe ups and downs due to her limited mental strength. He convinced me to go for it and I wept in his arms. That was probably the first time in my life someone did not look the other way and I allowed myself to be vulnerable, instead of distant and cold. I opened myself up to him.  Few years later my home situation imploded. I ran. His mother took me under her wing, I think she was the first parental figure I could lean on in my life. His father loathed me as the girl from the slums, threatening me in private to never marry his son. Reminding me of my lowly descent when he could. He would never come to accept me fully but at least fully respects me in public, which to me is commendable enough.  Afterwards I started living with my now SO, still during our teens in a studio. The idea was triggered and pushed for by me as a solution after a bout of infidelity on his side after he moved to study in a city a couple hours away. He partook in intimate relations with a girl he knew from another country over webcam due to ‘’loneliness’’ and held the act in the same regards as watching porn whereas I didn’t. We tried to work things out.  As we did my view of him started to crumble, but was rebuilt after living together surprisingly worked remarkably well. We grew more towards each other and were best friends on top of lovers. In between this life changing chapter and where I am now, he has had a few strikes I simply can not forget. While I was once open to share my ups and downs and sadness with him, now I’d rather not. Because where I once trusted him to hold me, I now trust him to ridicule me and tell me to man the fuck up. And the stubborn ass I am, I do, but this comes with resentment. But to explain the strikes:  - One is where I was crying after having particularly bad and involuntary memories. Annoyed by my state and stressed by upcoming finals he asked me: When is this going to end? You’re always spinning the same old tales, you’re driving yourself insane.  - Another was when he screamed out while we had visitors: How would you like it if I told everyone you were raped? He believed I had done something utterly despicable, blame was pinned upon me by one of his siblings. In that moment something broke, the attack was 100% unwarranted. So much trust lost. When he figured out I had done nothing to him the apologies came swift and numerous.  - One was when I asked him for a letter. He will always buy flowers on special occasions, which I hate. They wither and die. I just hate the sentiment, I dislike it and I have communicated this. I wanted something which lasts. A reminder. All I wanted was a letter. Years I secretly yearned for one but received flowers instead, which I still tended to. Finally… I asked for a letter. He refused and told me point blank to my face he would not. That it was silly I needed something to hold onto, and that this item would become something of an unhealthy obsession.  - The latest strike was after I endured a panic attack while I was on my own, which I managed myself before he returned home. He was upset when I confided in him and he stated: I will not be on your side if you are mentally ill. I will choose our children and make sure they grow up with stability. (Later he corrected himself and stated that if I was to turn schizophrenic or manic, he would have me committed and divorce me, but would support me through depression and anxiety).  Now to me a panic attack is something manageable if you are equipped to deal with it. Through the years I have learned to be aware of my surroundings and triggers and to be prepared to deal with anything since I am responsible for my children. I have no history of hysterical or erratic behavior, so I found his reaction to my first ever panic attack very… crude.  I have my pride even through my depression for what I have survived and what I have accomplished. But I hate that I can not find it in myself again to open up towards my spouse and more than often find myself crying when I am capable to, so I can put up my smile and brave face when I NEED to. I’ve successfully faked it till I made it. And of the 15 years that we have been together the good by far outweighs the bad, something which can not be conveyed well enough in this post. But what has been said can be never taken back. Even though recently he said: Don't you understand after 15 years I am on your side?   I understand. I hate that I can’t be vulnerable anymore. I hate that the trust is gone, and the resentment grows. If anyone has advice or a similar story of lost trust, I’d just love to hear and talk about it, if only to gain some perspective.

I have gone days without talking to anyone I just got out of a bad relationship recently. But I have a issue with dependancy. I let him dictate my entire life. I let him into my head to the point I feel brainwashed. I hate everyone. I don't trust anyone. I don't want to talk to anyone because I know he will get mad and be jealous. He is the closest and only person I have in my life and even though we broke up he wants us to remain best friends. We dated for 2 years and it was Rocky the entire time. But I let him get his hooks into me and I can't get out. I am terrified to not have him in my life because then I will be truly alone. I don't talk to anyone else. I am 26 years old and I have 0 friends other then him. I am terrified of being alone. But he is seeing someone else now. She is 100 times better then me in every way. She is super model gorgeous and everything that me and him shared she has as well. I feel replaced. But I don't want to not be his friend and not have him in my life. I'm terrified to lose him. I cling to the hope one day he will want me again. I haven't talked to another person in over a week. and if he is busy with her I don't talk to anyone at all. I just lay on my couch staring at the wall and having a constant never ending panic attack. I have sever depression and severe anxiety that I take medicine for both. But they only make the feelings bearable and don't take them away completely. I don't sleep. I just want to throw myself at every fuck boy on dating apps just to have some kind of physical attention even if it is only sex. Even if I am not attracted to them. I don't care. I just want someone to love me. I want someone to hold me and make me feel not alone. I don't know what to do. I feel like I've been kicked in the chest. It hurts to breathe. I made a noose and stood on a stool with it around my neck for over a hour the other night crying. But I couldn't do it.

I had skipped work today because this dream was too good to just let the alarm clock interrupt it. I've been able to hold onto my dreams a lot lately. Such as I can wake up and roll over and fall back asleep in the exact spot in the dream I left off....  Now the dream is I'm at some party. The room is very lavish looking. And everyone there I know. Feels like this party was somehow for me. Never has ever happened. Now the part that stands out is that I see my teacher who was my mentor she was everything to me. When I was in high school I not only had this HUGE crush on her but she was the kind of actor I had always wanted to be except I was willing to die for my art. Still am. She's sitting with her two kids. They're probably the most gorgeous kids I've ever seen and she hasn't changed. Her husband is in the distance somewhere. I never see him but I am aware of him. I thank her for all her time and effort she put into me and I ask her how it's going with her life and if she's still teaching. We talk about something else and the dream slowly fades away.  Reality is I haven't heard from this teacher since I graduated. I heard she had a kid and she moved to vermont. I miss her terribly. Somehow this dream seems to have more than just one meaning.

Suicide is all I can think of right now and I'm scared to do it only because the thought of becoming a vegetable and having to live like that terrifies me. I guess this is one more step I'm trying out to kind of ease myself into the whole thing.  People told me 10 years ago to stick with it because it'll get better. They still tell me that even though I would love to go back 10 years now because of how much worse its gotten and how much better even that was compared to now. I didn't think it would get this bad but it did.  I've been through so many medications, doctors, checked myself into a hospital 3 times when I was sure I was going to do kill myself, called the suicide hotline several times, talked with friends, made lifestyle changes and all that. It still didn't work. I've only gotten more depressed.  There's no helping me. I am just supposed to feel miserable. I'll never be happy. I'm not sure at this point if I even want to be happy anyways.  Hoping I can work up the courage to kill myself by the end of today.

"Can’t fix anything in my life I’m such a fundamentally broken person. I’ve want to say I’ve been fighting for years, but that’a not true. All I can do is fucking run away from everything until the day is over. No action I take to improve myself can ever have weight because I’m so godddamn broken that when I try to do something to better myself, it just reminds me of how much of a fucking loser I am. I cannot handle the fucking *pain* that comes with self improvement. It’s not fun in the least. It’s humbling. Too humbling. And it just shoves in my face all the time I’ve wasted and all of the experiences I never had simply by virtue of being my self.   Everyone who’s happy acts like life is just some natural occurrence. Like things just happened to them and fell into place. This couldn’t be further from the truth of my experience. Nothing ever just happens organically. Either I try hard and fail due to my lack of intelligence, or I don’t do anything at all. It’s hard to stay happy after constant failure and social rejection. I’ve never had interests or goals or relationships or friends. I never will. These thing don’t just happen. You have to be a certain kind of person for them to happen. I am not that person. I will never be that person because I don’t even know who I want to be, and if I figured that out I would be too insecure to become that.   All I see in my future is homelessness and destitution because I came into adulthood with absolutely zero interests, special memories, or relevant/helpful past experiences. My memory of my life in general is so goddam hazy at this point, if I ever did have those things, they have long been gone to the abyss. I just think why. Why do I have to be so broken and dysfunctional among everyone else? I’m not even a real person. I’m a complete shell of what could have been a person. This is too difficult to come to terms with, while impossible to argue against. It is true. It is my reality. It honestly just makes me angry, bitter, and jealous of others, at a very deep, fundamental, human level, for what the healthy people have. I fantasize about taking two AR-15s and unloading on people. Maybe I know them, maybe I don’t, it wouldn’t matter. Often lives completely lose their value when my headspace gets dark enough. Not as the result of an “illness” but of the fact that I am who I am both physically and psychologically. Blind rage. That is what the result of my dysfunction is. Pure fucking anger at both the world and myself. Unable to cope with my grim reality, all I want to do is destroy.   The only thing I could ever really destroy is myself. The thought of my life slipping away becomes more attractive by the day as I see how impossible my desires are and how completely fruitless any effort to change is sure to be, just like it always has. I can’t handle the responsibility of being alive and I don’t want to anymore. I’m just here for the hedonistic pleasures life sometimes offers, until either I or something else kills me.

"Just some curious questions here. I am recently undergoing lots of stress in my life. My work is failing and I am struggling keeping up. I recently have a new born in the family as well and extra workload at home too. I noticed these few symptoms:1) Often worrying, going in a loop worrying even about small things 2) Very easily agitated, get angry very easy 3) Weird sleeping pattern, can't sleep at night and sleep 10-12 hours straight during the day 4) Hard to concentrate at anything serious, easily distracted 5) Have up and down moments, sometimes it feels as though nothing has happened, sometimes it hits hard and I could waste one whole day just sitting at home being totally non productive. 6) Easily give up at everything I do, everything seems to be hopeless at times. I am putting off going to the doctors for a long time now. I previously been to the doctors and was given 2 different kind of antidepressants and I really felt awful taking them and stopped. I am reluctant going back because of the same reason. Is this a serious matter that warrants me to see the doctor again? Just hate the feeling but I noticed the ""downs"" have been coming on more and more lately due to more stress load.

"I feel like nothing works or will work out, can someone relate? It‘s always like I try something and want to better myself, have high expectations and then life comes, uppercuts me, spits on me and just screams „You thought, bitch“.   I had a really good therapist but she suddenly quit due to illness.    I had to wait several months until I got the final answer. Had no therapy in that time between and also we only had like 6 sessions.   Now I have a therapist who is ok but I just don‘t vibe with her that much. And I can‘t change because of insurance. Nor do I have the money to pay for one myself since I‘m a broke ass student.    I told her once that I don‘t want solutions. I want someone to genuienly understand me. At first she tried and now it’s all solutions again. „Try this, try that, we need to experiment“. I get the thought but I feel like my deep down feelings are just irrelevant once again.   My first therapist really understood me and listened. I could cry my heart out and afterwards I felt so much lighter.    I really miss that feeling.   Now it‘s just an obligation I have to do. Back then I never used to come late to my therapy sessions because I really looked forward to it.   But now I am constantly running late because deep down, I just don‘t want to go anymore and give up. I don‘t have energy for that.   I also took anti depressants (Tianeurax if anyone knows that one). At first it helped me, especially with processing feelings.   But then I turned super suicidal and had mental breakdowns over mental breakdowns.    I completly stopped and now I feel numb again. I want to feel suicidal and emotional again, to be honest. At least I processed something. Now I feel empty and dead inside once again, like how I used to be all the years before I started therapy and taking anti depressants.   My „new“ therapist asked me what I can bear more. My suicidal state or this passive suicidal state. I told her the last one. But honestly, I want it to be the first one.   At least I felt like a human. At least some people cared because they were afraid I‘d do something to myself.   Now no one cares. I‘m alone. I don‘t go outside anymore. I‘m just isolating myself again. No one really talks to me and I‘m just a bother to everyone.    I honestly think about taking my anti depressants again, just to get suicidal and off myself.   Despite often being a bad actor, I am just so well at playing this role of „Of course, I will try! I will do my best“.   I‘m good at pretending nothing bother‘s me and everything‘s fine. I‘m good at pretending to say „Wow, your advice helped me so much, thank you for listening!“.   But I‘m just a fraud. Nothing helps. Afterwards I just want to die more.    Sometimes I ask myself, why the hell do I even put up with all of this. The only reason why I haven‘t killed myself yet is because it‘d financially ruin my family.   I don‘t even care about emotions, I doubt it‘d be that bad. No one likes me anyway. Just so they don‘t get into debt with my death or sth.    I often find myself also thinking that I will never leave a goodbye letter or tell them goodbye. Because no one cares anyway. I told them many times before why I want to die.   I don‘t feel like anyone deserves that anyway because they don‘t put as much energy into me as I put into them.    Whenever I feel like it goes up, it just crumbles down. I really don‘t know how much of this I can take.   I‘ve been like this since 6 years old. I‘m 21 now. I don‘t know why I got thrown into this world when I‘m ridden and infested with mental illnesses.

However, he didn't say a word to me. He ignored me. He didn't even look at me. I didn't want to ignore him, i tried to get his attention, but i just didn't manage. It frustrated me. I just didn't understand why he deliberately ignored me. I was so down, I started cutting again, didn't eat for days, ...  It lasted one year. The whole year he never said a word to me. Not even when my sister died.  I don't understand it today and I never will. I never will forget the pain. However, i don't blame him for ignoring me. Everybody has the right to ignore me. But it hurts me so much.  And today I always get the feeling people ignore me. And when people i care about do so, it's horrible. Maybe they don't deliberately ignore me, but i always think they do.

"I feel like culture is a big reason why a lot of people don’t seek out professional help I don’t know much about other cultures, but I live in a Hispanic/American household. I feel immigrants’ families are typically a very work focused group. They expect you to just tough it out and push through everything . Most people in these communities don’t see depression as an illness, but rather as an excuse for being lazy or unmotivated. There’s almost a macho type mindset that you aren’t supposed to talk about those bad feelings and that shit really sucks.

"I don't know what to do with myself anymore. Last year, I met a wonderful friend online. We began dating in February of 2017 and have been inseparable ever since. However, we both have mental illnesses, for me I have PTSD and depression, and for him ADHD and depression. He's being treated for both, I'm untreated because of my family and our financial situation.  I'm afraid I'm frustrating him. I feel like I'm dragging him down. He's tried to get me to take better care of myself, but it's hard, seeing as we're long distance and I always slip back into my bad habits. I feel like I pissed him off tonight and I never understood why he got frustrated, but now I think I do. No matter what, I didn't really listen or heed his advice, and I'm afraid because of that he's going to decide that I'm unmanageable and he'll leave me.

"Feeling Good is an excellent book. I have re-read a few times when I've felt the need. If you are looking at something for anxiety and panic, I suggest Mastering Anxiety and Panic revision III (map-3) by David Barlow. I suffered from anxiety, panic attacks and agoraphobia from the time I was 12 until last year...that's 30 years. Nothing had ever helped until I found a therapist that uses that program. A different way of looking at things and I have to say that I worked miracles for me. I am driving, flying, going to concerts, sporting events...things I haven't done for over 20 years. I NEVER thought I could get better and only went because my boyfriend of 8 years was honest with me and told me that he didn't know if he could spend the rest of his life going every place alone. That was a wake up call for me and to my surprise, I found that I COULD do it. I still have my depression and I am endlessly working on being medicated correctly for that.... all of you know how that is. You can buy just the workbook www.oup.com (Oxford University Press).

"I've been reading this subreddit for awhile. Well, as the title says I have been reading this stuff for months. I think I'm depressed. I'm not sure why though. I have a really good long-term boyfriend, everything I need and a lot of things I just want. I've been ""depressed"" as long as I can remember. I think about killing myself every day, multiple times a day. Like, ""oh, i dropped something, well better kill myself"" ""Oh, I failed that math problem, you're worthless better kill yourself now"" I can barely shower most days. I don't know why my boyfriend hasn't broken up with me. Sometimes I wish he would so I could just kill myself. I feel really bad for him.   I have anger issues I think, My moods change really fast, it is hard to keep up with them and I don't know why it happens. Most days I don't want to get out of bed. I don't have any friends. I always feel like everyone hates me.   It would just be so much easier to die, why do people bother with life? What is the point? Everyone has always said that things ""get better"" but they don't really. They change and then something else sucks.  Nothing makes me happy, I don't enjoy doing anything that I can do by myself. I hate being alone, I hate my own company. I guess I just hate myself. Is this depression? Do I just suck? Maybe I'm just being dramatic.   I wanna be a better person but I don't know how. My anxiety feels like a prison. It's really hard for me to leave the house. I HATE being around people, but I don't want to be alone either. Going to the store is a nightmare for me, the panic attacks and worrying I'm in someones way all the time. I only go in the middle of the night and never by myself.   What is wrong with me? Why can't I do things normal people do? Is there any point in existing when you always feel miserable? This is the most awkward thing I've done in awhile, Time to take a nap and forget I posted here.

"I had my second appointment with my naturopathic doctor today. I'm getting this feeling that she is really just a therapist for people who don't want to go to a therapist. She lets me ramble on about all sorts of things that have very little to do with my health. Like what our rules for Jeffrey and food are.

I'm not sure if these things do anything more than lighten my wallet, but I'm willing to try them for now. I do desperately need to lose weight and if there is any chance that these things will help, I'm willing to go for it for a while.

"i am a 16 year old. i think i am depressed, but i don't know how to tell. um...it is like i am afraid to tell my parents because i know them, they will brush it off as no big deal or make me sit down and tell them what is going on. Did they ever think that i don't want to talk to them? My mother is like a roller coaster ride you cannot wait to get off of. One day she could care less that i am sick, or that i need to tell her something, and then the next day she is all, talk to me, tell me what is going on. God it can be so annoying. i know that i have a problem with my emotions, i just can't seem to control them, when i am upset, stressed, angry, sad. There are always three things that i do. First i cry, then i scream, then i run to my room, and sometimes i might knock something down. And that gets me another, what is going on talk. Two years ago my grandma died. We weren't that close and i think that is part of my problem. every time i try to go to sleep i just lay there and think about my life, and realize, there isn't that one person, you know, everyone has one, that one person that you can just call up and say, ""hey, i am in a bad mood, can you talk..."" or ""hey i just got in another stupid fight with my mom, do you have time to talk to me..."" and maybe that is what is wrong with me, i don't have someone to vent to so i keep it all inside. i mean i try and find ways to let my anger and frustration out like, i am a poet, sort of. Everyone tells me i am at least, but what they don't seem to understand is that maybe i am a good poet because i have nowhere else to let all of this out. No one can see that, no one can see that i need someone to talk to. i try and talk to my mom, but she is so busy, and that is not her fault, it isn't like she is ignoring me on purpose, she has school, she has work, she has my brother's wrestling match, she has a meeting. then i try and talk to my friends, and i know that they would listen and they would try and understand, but i don't know, i just don't feel as though they need all of my crap on their shoulders, not that you do either, who ever is still reading this. i guess it is that sometimes, i feel ignored. i turned sixteen this year. Happy Sweet Sixteen...right? i wanted to have a party, i wanted to go out and have a good time. But that didn't exactly work out the way i had planned. At first i thought that my friends had forgotten about me, no call on my birthday, no card. And then they threw me a surprise party, nothing big and fancy, just small, just the four of us, the way we like it, but still it felt weird, it just didn't feel right. i am supposed to be driving, i have my temporary permit, i have had them since October, you know how much i have driven, about one hour. i could have gotten my license last month, but i cannot go to driving school until i get more experience, and i can't get more experience until one of my parents decides to let me drive. They used to take my brother out all the time, they would let him drive everywhere. i don't know, i just feel like sometimes being the middle child and the only girl i get ignored. i am a cutter. i tried to tell my parents three times that i was a cutter and i wanted to stop. i couldn't tell them in words so i wrote them a letter, they never read it. you probably think i am some selfish person, but i just have been holding all of this inside of me for three months now and there is more down inside of me, i just need to slowly let it out.

"A rant, I guess I had to come off of my antidepressants for medical testing. I'm finally off of them and I can't take this. I didn't think they were working and I definitely wasn't where I wanted to be when I was at my maximum dose, but oh my God. I started them for anxiety mostly so I'm surprised that I'm relapsing so hard into depression. I just wish I didn't exist-- eh, better yet I wish I didn't have to participate in every day life. I don't know what to do. I used to have so much motivation to finish my college work and now I have none. I have finals that start tomorrow that I haven't studied for at all. Like, not even a little. And somehow I don't care. That's just not like me. I'm exhausted from putting so much effort in all the time. I exhausted from being stressed all the time. I don't want to keep doing this. I just want to sleep. And to think I have four more years ahead of me. I don't know what I'm going to do. I already feel like a failure. I keep thinking that maybe I could find something to take my mind off things but I have no hobbies. I don't enjoy anything any more. Not even eating, which I used to love probably too much but hey.

"I am Mark, this is my first post on here. I am feeling really scared of myself at the moment, I have been depressed to some extent for as long as i can remember, and have had many hospital admissions in the past, but for the past few years life has been manageable, I have been in a relationship, not a very good relationship but one that helped me feel safe, i stopped overdosing and cutting, the relationship as i said had its downsides i am not sure love is the word to describe what we had but it was a strong feeling whatever it was, and now that we are no longer together i realize that whatever we had was stronger than anything i had before. i am so lonely and have very scary thoughts, you see my partner has moved back to his home country as he had no choice he was living here illegally, the days we were together before he left i started to have very disturbing thoughts, i even thought of killing him as it would be easier than living without him!!! that is very scary. now that he is gone all the old feelings i used to have about myself and the hatred i have for myself is showing again, he was my protector, my distraction i suppose. but now i don't have that i feel it is only a matter of time until i do some thing really stupid. i have not acted yet as i do not what to have a 'failed' attempt, i am not sure i want help, that is why i am looking here first maybe after this rant i will understand what is happening a bit more, maybe not. all i know at this point is i would rather not be alive, not sure i want to kill myself but i don't want to be alive, don't know if that makes sense",mark post here feeling really scared moment depressed extent long remember hospital admission past past year life manageable relationship not good relationship helped feel safe stopped overdosing cutting relationship said downside not sure love word strong feeling wa longer realize stronger before lonely scary thought partner moved home country choice living illegally day left started disturbing thought thought killing easier living him scary gone old feeling used hatred showing again protector distraction suppose not feel matter time thing really stupid not acted not failed attempt not sure want help looking maybe rant understand happening bit more maybe not know point not alive not sure want kill not want alive not know make sense,0.4917806386947632,0.32569530606269836,0.47924599051475525
"I'm so mad at myself.  Angry more like it.  I truly hate myself right now.  My wife and I are currently separated, and it's all my fault.  I know, I know, 'don't blame yourself'.  Well, the truth is that it is all my fault this time.  I did some pretty terrible things to my wife and family to make them leave.   I also opened my mouth when I should have just kept it shut.  I said some pretty stupid things over the past year plus.  I had become some sort of monster, and didn't know what to do.  When it got found out about, I told my wife that I wanted her to take the kids and get away from me.  Why did I do that?  I love my wife very much, and don't want to lose her.  I just don't know how to express that to her.  I'm so angry that I just want to hurt myself.  I don't care how or what happens.  I want things to go back to the way they were before I started having my problems.  I just want to shout and hit something or someone.   I wish someone could help me.  I am seeing a therapist, but I don't know if it is helping.  My mind is still a jumbled up mess.  My life is even worse, and I don't know what to do to make it better.   I feel so down and out of it.  I can't sleep, I don't want to stay awake.  I don't feel like eating at all.  I just don't think I care much any more.  What good will it do to get my life straightened out if I don't have anyone to share my new life with.   I've been so unhappy and depressed for so long, I'm not sure I even remember how to be happy.  Why do I feel this way all the time?  I'm so unhappy all the time that my wife thinks that it is her that I am unhappy with.  Honestly, I don't know any more.  What's wrong with me?  I see all these happy couples walking around, and here all these happy Christmas carols being played on the radio, and I get very jealous.  Why can't I be happy like that?  Why couldn't I be happy with what I had?  I had everything that I ever wanted, a loving, beautiful wife, two great kids, and one more on the way.  I should have been the happiest man in the world.  Instead, I screwed it all up and lost everything that I held dear to me.  What kind of idiot does something like that?  I just needed to rant a little.  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Did I feel better after I realized other people are suffering with me? No. Maybe if I told a friend, to my brother that I'm feeling like shit, maybe, I would feel better,but to unknown people on the internet? What they tell me is worthless.  I don't need to feel comforted or understood, I need help from people and receiving advices on how I can improve my life or stories of people feeling better. Something which is really lacking on this sub. I want to feel better and I don't care about intellectualizing my pain or feel comforted.

"There is a genetic weakness in my family - virtually everyone has been on medications at some time, or is on medications now, for depression and anxiety disorders. It seems to onset around puberty. I have had a truly horrible time over the last 3 years supporting my depressed daughter (now aged 15) and, more recently, my 22 year old son. I have been taking 340 mg of St John's Wort once a day for about a year, but I am aware that the genes are kicking in, and I am now quite ill in my own right. I really don't want to take prescription medications, as I have seen the horrible side effects that my daughter and son have experienced as the medications have kicked in - she has had to change medications once as she reacted so badly. Just from looking at the size of the St John's Wort pills available, it is obvious that I could take a much higher dose. Does anyone know anything about dosage, and whether it would be better to take doses throughout the day rather than just once?

There is some kind of block in my brain that’s screwing that up due to my many disorders.

"I went to College for Political Science. Now I can't stand politics. When I started college in 2012, my goal was to join the foreign service to represent my country to people abroad. I loathe Trump and all he stands for. My grandmother lost every single relative in Europe to the Nazis, and two days after the election I saw another student at the University come in wearing an SS logo. And with Nazis marching every month I am am ashamed to be American. I have been running behind in college for a while, but as long as I had serving my country to look forward to I kept going. At this point though I would rather be dead than associated with this country.   I can't even avoid the toxicity of politics because that is what my degree is in. I spent the last year trying as hard as I could to think of any reason to keep going. I can't find one. I wrote my first suicide note last month all about my feeling of meaninglessness in a country that killed the country I loved.   While I wallowed in self loathing, I have costed my mother so much money. Once my sister started college she had to cash out her 401k to keep us both in college because I didn't get a scholarship and didn't graduate. I would get a job, but I don't have a driver's license and public transportation doesn't go by my house. When I drop out of school my student loans will come due, and if I can't pay them my family will try. The only way out I can think of is death.

"Looking for an opinion So I have been angry for awhile now, and I feel like my anger is unjustified. A few weeks, I told one of my close friends that I had feelings for her, and I also told her I wanted some space to get over these feelings. This is because I couldn't be with her. She has a significant other.   Soon after, she wouldn't talk to me at all, and she avoided me. All of her friends told me that I shouldn't have done that because it was a bad thing to do. I just wanted to tell her that I wanted some space from her, so I could no longer have feelings for her. Since then, all of her friends, have treated me with aggression and insults. I get dismissed every time I'm around her and all of her friends. This has launched me into another Depressive episode.   I was yelled at by other people and ostracized.   I was thinking that what I did wasn't so bad, but maybe I'm wrong. I feel like a bad person.

" I've had United Healthcare as my health insurer for 7 years. For the past 6 years they have dutifully paid 80% of my weekly visits to my psychiatrist without any problem. Then, quite suddenly last August, they stopped paying my doctor anything for my visits.

Neither of us received any notice that my benefits were about to expire. My doctor and I have written letters and called the insurer asking them appeal my case, but they refuse to allow me any more benefits for visits.

"It's been a while since I've written and I decided to start off again with a bit of a bang. I'm going to post my story of beginning recovery, this is to try and cheer some people up and to let them know that they could do it too. Well now, where to start.... About a year and a half ago (the beginning of Grade 8) is when I started to notice the changes. Not physical but emotional. I had been told many times that this was very normal for teenagers so I thought nothing of it. There was an incident with a rather immature and nasty young man, who I just happened to have an ENORMOUS crush on. Anyway we both kind of lead each other on for a while but nothing happened, than he meet this girl at a hockey game. He immediately started talking about her all the time and how he really loved her so much.  I began to feel more and more useless. After that I started rolling down hill like a circle of cheese, and by March of that year I was quite close to suicide at several occasions. This is when I started noticing that this might not be normal and tried many self-help methods, all of which failed. I thought Grade 9 could be a new beginning, it wasn't. My grades were starting to slip and I just couldn't be happy anymore. Finally after a close call in December I told my mum all about my failed attempts and how I was feeling. She agreed to get me a new doctor. I visited her and I got diagnosed with depression and was prescribed Cipralex. Of course that took a while to work too which involved me missing a lot of school, falling really far behind, and having several more close calls. Finally I started feeling a little better and was even stable enough to start going back to school and going to visit my family in the East. Well I just got back from that trip and I have never felt better. I am ready to face the world. That trip was just what I needed. When I get through these next weeks until my birthday all I can see is a varely clear path ahead! For the first time in a year and a half I can concentrate and tolerate less than perfect circumstances. I hope everyone here will feel this way, you can if you just push through! Power to us!

"Does anyone else get very irritable whenever you're hungry? The biggest problem in my life is that I get extremely irritable when I'm hungry. I'll find myself fantasizing about getting in argument or getting mad about something and then kinda snap out of it and realize I'm actually just hungry. Then I get something to eat and I can feel some of the stress melting away, taking deep breaths and shit. This happens every day.  This makes me pretty cranky while I'm making something to eat in the kitchen. If anyone tries to talk to me I just want nothing to do with them until I get some food in me.

I'm probably quite good looking but I've never been in a relationship; I'm still a kissless virgin. This eats me alive and makes me afraid to talk to women. Another reason to isolate further.  I'm losing touch with reality. I have loving parents but their advice isn't particularly helpful. What I want is a friend, someone to talk to--but the anxiety gets in the way. I can talk to people in a structured setting, like therapy, or online (and easily and freely at that). But it's the act of doing it in the real world, in a natural setting, that is just impossible.

"Hello I'm 25 from the UK, I have suffered from depression I would say most of my life, but have only been on medicines (20mg of Prozac) for just over 2 years on and off, I've had times off the medicines and relapsed back into depression and the last time I saw my doctor he said It would be better for me to stay on antidepressants long term. The Prozac is working for me at the moment However I find the medicines interrupt my sleep and I wake 3 or 4 times a night and the sleep I do get is very light and ""dreamy"" sleep, plus I seem to be a bit lightheaded and reckless, on my motorbike for example I do stupid things like speeding and other dangerous stuff (to myself not others), which before off the medicines I would never do because I was very paranoid and cautious. I was off Prozac for a while late last year and things went down hill fast, I was cutting my arms and wanted to kill myself, I felt I had no reason to live, I was drinking to relive the depression, and I was drinking about 10 to 12 cans of lager(or 3 bottles of wine) a night, thinking about it I was wrecking my liver and feeling even more depressed in the morning, plus I was putting on loads of weight with all the beers, which was another reason to make me feel like crap. After New Year I made the decision (with my doctor) to go back on the antidepressants, and cut the booze almost out (I still drink about 1 or 2 a night but that's all) because things could not get any worse. I feel a lot better, I am back in the gym and getting back into shape, and my job is going well, I am in a recovery stage at the moment, I just hope I don't f--k it up again like before.

It's getting better but at times it seemed it couldn't be much worse ... unless I did the unthinkable ...  at least most of the time it's unthinkable. Divorced for a little over a year know ... removed from a wife I came to realize was a classic borderline personality (look it up) ...

No license for the last 10 months (2 to go) and recovering emotionally and financially with Mom and Dad. Thank God someone cares.

Hungry and lonely for someone to just be nice to me and care about me  ... at least a little bit ... I find myself in my own prison having to acknowledge the fact ""Why would anyone want to have anything to do with me?"" Hard to accept, but the truth ... too much baggage ... my ex's baggage she handed off to me to spare herself her own truth. At times I wished I could just flip a switch and just go away. Times I thought about driving into a bridge abutment or into a truck at the last second. Absolutely crazy stuff. I can now see what was so logical at that time to be so desperate from too much pain suffered by the abuser she was.

"I don't particularly want to go into details about how I've been feeling the past couple of years, only because it's too much for me to go into, and I don't want to leave out important details or anything. In September 2005, I voluntarily admitted myself to the hospital's psych ward through my psychiatrist, the reason being because my depression had grown so severe that my muscles gave out and I couldn't move anymore, and my will to live had vanished entirely, I stopped eating, I was dehydrated, I stopped going to school, all I did was lay in bed all day, it's the only thing I could do. The decision to go to the hospital turned out to be a very, very big mistake, and I regret making that choice. I felt no connection with the other kids there, especially because I was a week away from turning eighteen, and most of them were thirteen, fourteen, and maybe one or two sixteen year olds. We were similar in an emotional aspect, but otherwise I couldn't relate to any of them. I just bored them, and the way they talked and the things they talked about just confused me. I did get involved with them to an extent during the last couple of days there, but I regret that now. This is a story in itself, but I also got involved with a girl there. She fell in love with me, and so did I fall in love with her, briefly. Only because a girl had never shown any attraction to me before, nor did a girl ever show any interest in me like she did. My feelings for her quickly faded after talking to her a couple of times outside the hospital. She turned out to be a real mess of a person. I did not suffer from the relationship, though. I do not talk to her anymore, and I actually became a better person because of it - I was enlightened. My depression practically disappeared following my discharge from the hospital. I don't know if it was because of the Zoloft that I had begun taking, or because I was finally free from that prison. By the way, I do have a form of claustrophobia. I am not particularly afraid of being in narrow or tight spaces... I am afraid of being locked in narrow or tight spaces. And the hospital was very small, and they did not let you leave or go where you wanted. You were confined to your room, the main recreation room, and the hallway connecting those two places. The day before I was discharged, I was constantly shaking, sweating, and going to the bathroom. I couldn't sleep, and I was afraid to move. I had to stay in my room most of the time and skip out on the group sessions. So anyway, even though I felt better right after getting out of the hospital, that quickly, VERY quickly changed. By mid-late October, I was on home-schooling (and will be until I graduate in June this year, I am a Senior in High School), and attending group therapy several days a week, as well as seeing a psychologist once a week and a psychiatrist every several weeks. All of this therapy did NOT help me. I was feeling extremely depressed and suicidal one night, after a brief fight with my dad (I accidentally bumped the curb while parking, he yelled at me to watch the curb, and I got very upset, pulled the parking break, and walked off while screaming about slitting my throat...), and called one of the therapists at my group therapy to help me. I'd locked myself in a room in my grandmother's basement, and I had called her so she could talk with me and help me to relax. Instead, she threatened to call the police if I didn't open the door and let my dad in. So I opened it, but after that I completely lost my trust in her and couldn't stand being around her anymore. Another counselor at the group therapy also lost my trust. I felt a connection with him, and trusted him a lot, so I told him about my girlfriend (whom I had met online - another story) and he kept on accusing me of things... like using her for sex, or not really being in love, and etcetera. So after having lost trust in two therapists, and then all sorts of insurance problems came up. I stopped going. A few weeks ago, I stopped going to my psychologist as well. I felt like I was being lectured by him instead of actually helped... On top of that, he was taking weekly co-pay from me while he knew my insurance did not require co-pay for anything psychological! (i.e. Counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc.) And he still owes me a couple hundred bucks. He also charged my insurance for appointments I had cancelled. Basically, I took two steps forward, and then three steps back. My depression is not as bad as it was in September 2004, but I am pretty much tired of living. I am constantly thinking of suicide, and have even written brief suicide notes and made plans (which I never carried out). My Zoloft has been at 150mg for the past couple of months. It's helped my social anxiety slightly, but my depression - no. I am aware of the state that I am in, and I am simply tired of it. My future is all dark, I don't see things getting better. When I spoke with my girlfriend this weekend, I cried the entire night...  I just couldn't take everything anymore. I saw a new psychologist last week, but again, I feel like I'm being lectured. I am eighteen years old, and being talked to as if I were twelve. It's insulting and makes me feel even more left out of things than I already do. I don't know.

"Hi, I am new here and don't know where to start, where to post or anything. I don't know what can help me, but I know that I don't like my self, and I am unhappy most of the time. I am not currently on any medicines (can't even do that right) and have never really been tested or diagnosed with anything other than depression. I live my life day dreaming of what could be and what should be......I am a 38 year old female and my problems started when I was born. I was born to an alcoholic dad whom I loved and a mom who did the best she could whom I love as well. My whole family was in therapy from about the time I was 4 years old. Our family therapist/doctor was Dr. Love, I am not kidding that was his real name. All kinds of things were going on in my family that I was not aware of until I was grown. One was the fact that my real father was sexually molesting my older half sister.......I was labeled a ""bad child"" ""out of control child"" and was locked in my room for hours at the time which was what our doctor told them to do.....I would not cry when I was punished or spanked and my mom would have to stop my dad from whipping me to keep him from killing me I suppose. I was the youngest of 4 children, 1 real sister 1 half sister and one half brother. Although after I was grown I found out that my real sister was only half too... I was very creative in a strange kind of way while I was locked in my room. I would open my window a scream for help with my tape recorder on, so when I got tired I could play it back so maybe someone would come......we had big metal blinds in the windows and for some reason I would raise the blind all the way up and tie the string to my door knob when I would go to sleep at night so the blind would fall if anyone opened my door... Crazy huh??? Any way, when I was about 11 years old I was put in a foster home, you know cause I was a bad child. Then I went to group homes, back and fourth here and yonder. Never tested for anything.....never medicated.....I was back and fourth from home, foster homes, group homes and mental hospital from the age 11 to 16. During one of the times I was gone my parents divorced, and my mom moved to a new house. I had met a guy during one of my short stays home, and thought that he was my world. You know by then I thought no one loved me, except for him. He was my world. My oldest sister told me that if we got married I couldn't be sent away any more. She knew how it was being at those places in the 70's and 80's....I mean if you weren't already ""mad"" you would be.....So I married the only person in the world that I thought loved me......As soon as we were married, I got pregnant. He cheated on me, controlled me, I couldn't even go outside without him beating me. He would come in from his girlfriend's house and if I said anything about it, he would go off and throw things and call me every name in the book, take aerosol spray cans and a lighter and throw flames at me until I was in the corner begging and crying for him to stop. He beat me in my stomach and said he hoped I lost the baby. He said if I ever left him he would kill me. I had to get stitches over my eye where he busted it. Of course I lied to the doctor.....scared for my life. All of this went on for a year, when my daughter was born he was not even there. His parents had to go get him out of his girlfriends bed....I was young and dumb. I thought that everything would get better now, I mean he was the only one in the world that ""loved"" me. Things got worse and when my daughter was weeks old he got in one of his moods and was beating on me and his grandma. That's who we lived with. He went out in the yard and took an axe to all the cars and his dad came over to stop him. My husband took the baby out of my arms and held her over his head in the street and threatened to drop her......that's the day I left him. His father called the police and had them come get him. Then he called my mom and told her she had better come get me and the baby if she didn't want us dead. He said that he had got my husband locked up for now, but that it was his son and that he did have to go get him out. So my mom came and helped me pack up and leave...... That is the first chapter of my life......it doesn't get any better.....but it does help to tell all on here. I will tell more later. I need to go to sleep for a while and pass some time.

"Just graduated university. Anxious and depressed, can't find a job, scared of losing partner over it Hi everyone. This is my first post on Reddit. I just felt like I needed advice from people who might understand.   I'm in my early twenties and just graduated with a bachelor degree in psych in October. I never really had a job during that time because I was lucky to have my school and expenses paid for and I wanted to focus on school. I've only had one job but it was 5 years ago just at a fast food place. My boyfriend of almost 4 years and I live together. He has a great job and pays for 2/3 of our expenses and I pay the rest.

I tried to help him with being motivated to work, and to be able to support himself.  I gave him every part of myself, because I loved him so much. And I keep holding on to things he said, before he forgot what this love really meant to him. And all the love that I gave to him, that never got into him. No matter how hard I tried.  I wish he knew I don't hate him for what he said to me and that my suicide attempts weren't to make him feel guilty. I genuinely wanted to end my life.   The thoughts of whatever I had done for him to hate me weighs so heavy upon me, that I fear to live with a guilt that was my own.

"I have lived with depression since I was little. I was molested by my uncle and a family friend and my dad is in and out of prison all the time (I'm guessing that is where it all started from). Well, when I hit my freshman year in high school, I had no friends because I was so shy. I walked the halls alone, went to lunch alone, sat in the back of the classroom alone. I sat back there fantasizing about suicide and death, and I would cut myself, and I actually planned my suicide. By this point I was so far ""out of my mind"" that I couldn't take it anymore, so I went to my mom. I was diagnosed with severe depression, and I've been in counseling on and off ever since. I am now 18 years old, and I have made friends since, and i even got a boyfriend. Well. I haven't seen my counselor for a while now, and in the past few months I feel like my depression is worse than it has ever been. So many things have been happening to me, that I just can't take it anymore. I lost the friends that I had, and I don't even know why exactly. My boyfriend just broke up with me, after we had been together for two years. I've started to cut myself again. i want to be dead. I know I should go to see my counselor, and i tried to make an appointment, but i feel it's too late. i feel like I'm on the edge of a huge cliff, and if I get pushed just a little more, I'm done. i don't know what to do, I just cant take it anymore! If someone could please just give me some advice I would greatly appreciate it.

"My mom mocks my depression to her friends My mom doesn’t believe I’m depressed even though all the psychologists I’ve been to so far tell her I am - and i KNOW myself that feeling like I want to kill myself all the time isn’t a healthy mindset. I’ve tried to off myself a few times to no avail (without her knowing) and narrowly escaped inpatient. She calls me lazy and ungrateful, complains about how I don’t do anything productive and sit around all day, I don’t eat much if anything. She treats me so awfully and if I retaliate in the same way all of a sudden I’m the bad person. And here’s the worst of it: I heard her talking about me to her friend, laughing and mocking me, saying stuff like ‘oh everything is always wrong for her, poor girl! she says shes depressed but i know she’s making it up for attention so she doesnt have to do work around the house like the lazy bitch she is’ It crushes me even further and at this point I don’t know what to do.

"I feel like a useless member of my family I may not help as much as the perfect husband would around the house. But, I’d like to think I do a decent share of what traditionally a husband should be doing. My wife is not the most organized person in the world so me and her butt heads a lot when it come to finding things around the house. Car keys, laundry, tools, you name it, they will get lost around the house.   I have tried taking my own copies of keys with me in my backpack to work or where ever I go. This way I don’t have to be asking her all the time where to find X item. This was working til she lost her copy of the truck keys and had to call me to bring my copy to her one day. Since then, I only bring the key of the car that I bring with me. Well,.... didn’t take too long til that one got lost too.... I needed to use the truck and was not able to find any key anywhere. I asked her where it was and she responded with “you have hands and eyes, you find it”. I blew my top off. I yelled at her that the fact that I have to hide things for them to not get lost in the house is ridiculous!   She brought up the fact that I could do more around the house like organize the laundry or help her keep the home tidy. I told her I would if she wasn’t so damn unorganized. Every time i do end up helping her organize and clean she ends up messing everything up the next day anyway!   She is type A personality and I would like to think I am type A-. I yield to her way of living most of the time til it gets to be too much. Maybe the reason I don’t do more around the house is because it will yield the same results anyway, an unorganized mess.... I at least do the basics. I pickup after dinner. I take out the trash, (this job now goes to my son). Handyman work, I fix plumbing, appliances, broken doors, tv’s, computers, iPhones.  I would like to think that I play my role as a dad as perfect as I can. I help with homework, I play with my kids all the time. I feed them when mom works early or wants to sleep in/go to bed early.  She’s mad at me and I feel like I am trying my best but my best is not good enough. Also, says I have become obese because of my laziness...... that one really hurt..... I try to walk/jog a good 30-40 minutes 2-3 times a week if I have time.   I broke down in my car today after seeing some old photos of my kids when they were babies.....

I moved about 6 months ago, and I have not had luck finding a therapist that I can work well with.

Don't get me wrong, talking does help, but I know from my years of dealing with this illness that I need some good solid cognitive therapy to help me to overcome my lack of self n worth / self n esteem / confidence.

"I've had quite a few life situations that have probably contributed to depression.1. I grew up in an emotionally/sexually abusive family...but the type of abuse that is just over the line enough to mess with your head, to make you wonder if it was really abusive or if you were just sensitive. I still talk to them and see them at times, but vast quantities of things go unsaid. 2. I left home for college, and almost immediately was recruited into a religious cult where I stayed for 14 or so years; I just got out a couple of years ago. 3. I had my first major depressive episode while inside and although I found a supportive therapist, she too was in the cult and therefore some of her advice at times was influenced by their beliefs. Also I was alternately shunned and ostracized, rebuked harshly, or encouraged to give up medicines/therapy by various members in various levels of leadership in the cult. 4. I very recently switched jobs to a much better job situation, but am still adjusting the environment. 5. We're in contract to purchase a home, which is great, but also an adjustment. The Question. My psychiatrist thinks I've been depressed for most of my life. Which makes sense when I look back over my journals and look at various things I did, said or experience. Thing is, to me, depression as a state of mind became normal. I didn't know anything different than how I was feeling. So what happens is this: I mention something I've been experiencing to my therapist. She is concerned and asks if I've brought it up to my psychiatrist. When I do bring it up to my psychiatrist, he says, ""Why didn't you mention this before?"" To which my response is: I didn't know I should. Translation: I thought it was normal. Right now I'm on Effexor, with Adderall XR as a booster plus synthroid due to a nasty run in with lithium. When I started I was okay. Great even, minus the utter exhaustion at the end of every day. Lately though I've been feeling...things...that I can't describe. Sadness...but a feeling bigger and diverse than the word ""sadness"" can contain. Tired...but a ""tired"" with an emotional component. Feelings I don't have words for, but that pierce me to the bone. And that are not connected with anything in real time that I can think of. Is this normal? Deep strong feelings that surface out of nowhere for a time and then dissipate...usually on the weekends when I don't have work to focus on? Not feeling much of anything in between those times? Being vibrant and full of ideas yet calm and productive first thing after I take the medicines, but gradually fading to sort of numb, definitely tired, somewhat negative by the afternoon with exhausted, sink into the couch with the remote, hit the bed for a nap by 7:30, sometimes 6pm?

"I am a 26 year old married mother of three boys. I was recently diagnosed as having depression. I have noticed it getting a lot worse in just the past week. At first I thought to myself I don't have anything to be depressed about but the more I thought about it the more I realized what it was. Me and my husband used to spend time with our kids and go out and do things on Fridays or the weekends. I can't remember the last time we just went to Walmart as a family for no reason other than to go. My husband doesn't understand what the effect of him not spending that time with me and us has had on me. Just like tonight instead of asking me and the boys to run to town with him, his friend went. I don't care if he is only going for an hour that's an hour we could have his time. I cry all the time when he's not here just because I miss my husband. I'm 26 we should have a healthy active life with our kids but instead I work and come home, and on my days off I sit at home with my kids. When he is off he stays at home. He works and then him and his friend if they get off early go places in town and then he comes home. I don't get to do that. I can't remember the last time I just went window shopping, just running around. My thoughts about not being around have gotten worse and that terrifies me.

"I was rejected &amp; I feel great Last night I asked a close friend of mine on a date and was rejected, but strangely enough I don't feel dejected but rather proud and accomplished.  To provide some background, I'll be turning 20 on the 15th, and last year, just 4 days after my 19th birthday, I was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder. This disorder is characterized by long lasting, essentially uninterrupted periods of depression lasting AT LEAST 2 years, and in many cases, such as with myself, far longer. To provide a rough estimate, I have been depressed somewhere around a total of 13 years of my life.  The depression has had a serious negative affect on my love life, at times making me cold and even cruel. The most egregious example of this was when, after having dated this girl for a few months, I stopped talking to her almost entirely and started flirting with other girls. Eventually she had to get her friend to break up with me on her behalf because I was refusing to talk to her. At the time, because of the depression, I thought little of myself, seeing myself as a worthless scumbag, and so I started acting like one. I was also afraid to open up to some else, so instead I became emotionally cold and avoidant. I hated this behavior in myself, and held a deep guilt for how I had treated women I had been with, so about 5 years ago I stopped dating entirely.  Despite being rejected, having finally had the confidence and self respect to ask out a woman and accept the no graciously is a major growth in my self esteem and wellbeing, so having done so I feel a great sense of accomplishment. This has really helped boost my self esteem and confidence, even though I was rejected.  There's no real point to this story, but I just wanted to get this out there, because I'm really proud of the progress I've made so far.",rejected amp feel great night asked close friend date rejected strangely not feel dejected proud accomplished provide background turning th year just day th birthday diagnosed persistent depressive disorder disorder characterized long lasting essentially uninterrupted period depression lasting year case myself far longer provide rough estimate depressed total year life depression negative affect love life time making cold cruel egregious example when having dated girl month stopped talking entirely started flirting girl eventually friend break behalf refusing talk her time depression thought little myself seeing worthless scumbag started acting like one afraid open else instead emotionally cold avoidant hated behavior myself held deep guilt treated woman with year ago stopped dating entirely despite rejected having finally confidence self respect ask woman accept graciously major growth self esteem wellbeing having feel great sense accomplishment really helped boost self esteem confidence rejected real point story just wanted there really proud progress far,0.44009581208229065,0.39295288920402527,0.4344486892223358

"Hi all, I'm new - just joined yesterday. I'm a 40-year-old wife and mother of five. I've struggled with depression my whole life - came from an abusive household and inherited some mixed-up genes. I was misdiagnosed last year with bi-polar II and spent a year on mood stabilizers and various other junk that made me a zombie. I'm now on Effexor and just beginning to feel sort of like myself again. I'm a freelance writer and I have a weekly column in our local newspaper. I feel like my creativity has gone to pot and I'm waiting for it to come back. Over the last 18 months I've become pretty reclusive - don't answer the phone, don't get out much, just take care of the basic family needs each day - so I've felt very alone. I stumbled upon this site while doing research on Effexor. I've read a lot of the posts and have felt some hope that this might be helpful to me right now. My husband is worn out, as am I. I just want to be better. I want to be a better mother. I don't want to live my life this way. I've felt like half a person for the last 18 months. I want to be whole again.

"How to deal with people who can't seem to be bothered with you? Question is fairly self-explanatory.   I ask this because recently (within the past 6 or so months), my supposed 'friends' have started to become quite distant with me and it's making me feel like total crap. They rarely ever contact me despite me having reached out a couple of times. It's all very fragmented. What hurts the most is I see them interacting with their other friends (on facebook etc.) and also that they have been online recently but still have not answered my messages. My friends used to be great, they used to consider me their closest friend and would reply quickly etc. But now I feel like I have been replaced and I have nobody left. Even back when I'd hang out with them, they'd be on their phone talking to these other friends of theirs and I feel so hurt.   Being alone sucks. No matter what, I can never seem to make friends with anyone new. The majority of other people my age are living it up, but I can't seem to do anything with anyone apart from my family. I feel like I'm missing out on something.  I feel so unwanted to the point I've started deleting all my social media to isolate myself even more. It's beginning to eat away at me and my depression is coming back, as much as I hate to admit it.

"Hi. I'm new, and I'm not really sure where to start in the forums! I've been treated for depression since I was 17 years old, and then misdiagnosed with ADD when I was 17 and that started a downward spiral with abusing Ritalin (snorting about 5-10 times my dosage) for about 5 years. That's over with. I battled with anorexia as a direct result of the Ritalin, and got down to 95 lbs. Then I ballooned up to 185 lbs. I lost 45 lbs. a few years ago and I've kept it off ever since (I've never gone above 144). I've been on Prozac since I was 17, and just recently switched to Cymbalta at the suggestion of my psychiatrist. I felt funny on it, and committed the ultimate sin: I stopped taking my medicines a week ago. I know that's bad. The last two days have been a nightmare, and I even contemplated swallowing a bottle of pills at one point. My fiance is the most amazing person in the world, and I'm literally killing him with my sickness. I don't know what to do. I've been hysterically crying and inconsolable for about a week. Yesterday my fiance called the psychiatrist on-call with our medical program, and she said I needed to take the Cymbalta, so I did take one pill yesterday and again this morning. I do feel weird, though. At the center of it all is my weight gain; I gained about 10ish pounds (I weigh 140 at the moment), and NONE of my clothes fit me. I feel like a disgusting fat blob all of the time. Just one look in the mirror sets me off and I'm HYSTERICAL for the rest of the day. All I want to do is sleep. SLEEP and never wake up. I've had an eating disorder in the past, and I know I can't fall back into it (the anorexia was a direct result of the Ritalin), but I am just hysterical, depressed, and I feel disgusting all day long. My clothes don't fit and I feel fat and disgusting and horrible and I want to cry and rip out my hair. I'm thinking this weight has a LOT to do with my recent downward turn in my depression, but I just can't lose the weight. I work out constantly and follow a really healthy/strict eating plan, and nothing is working. I'm just reaching the end of my rope, here. And to top it all off: I'm getting married next month. I need help...I've called my psychiatrist, but I don't know what to do. I don't see a psychologist; I think I need to, but I've had bad experiences in the past. I think I just need help and guidance and a way to lose this weight and feel good about myself.

"I'm brand-new here at these forums. I've come to you all to seek guidance/wisdom from any of you who has suffered or is currently suffering from depression. Within the past 3 years I have struggled on and off with this disease. For the most part I've had it under control, until relatively recently. About four months ago I was drastically descending downwards mental health wise. The result of this declination helped obstruct all aspects of my social life, causing an abrupt, painful end to many friendships I endeared. Also my negative behavior started to poison. The equilibrium that my family and I shared. The result of all this lead not only to my choice of isolation , but even if I chose not to isolate myself, I still had damaged relationships so much, that any attempts to make amends, and or repair former friendships, were futile. I basically pushed and alienated myself from everything I held dearest. Anyways, one day I just snapped; my ability to process information, perform simple math equations, remember things I had JUST thought of seconds before, concentrate, quick wit, and confident decision making had all been impaired immensely. Previously, before all of this, I was an ""A"" Honor Role student and had no difficulty functioning efficiently in my ""AP"" classes, but now I can barely sustain a low ""B"" average.

"Struggled with depression and anxiety for 3 years and made it through Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my experiences with depression and anxiety in the hope it might give someone else a reason to keep going. I’m new to reddit, so I hope this is okay!  I’ve struggled with severe depression and anxiety for the past three years and it’s honestly been the most difficult thing I’ve ever dealt with. Mental illness is silently crippling. I’ve spent more nights than I can remember wracked with sobs, feeling incredibly alone, and fantasizing about suicide. I’ve spent more days than I can remember feeling hollow, being apathetic, and not caring about what happened to me.   Depression is a fucking bitch, and even now, when I actually feel happy and loved and excited for my future, I’m not naive enough to think that I’ll never have to struggle with my mental health again. But I think I have learned how to best cope with it. Medication didn’t work for me, and while I do believe that professional therapy can be invaluable to people struggling with mental illness, it didn’t make a big difference in my case. But I learned to focus on the present, to rely on loved ones I’m lucky enough to have, and to forgive myself. Take it one small step at a time. So what if you couldn’t leave your room today? That shit’s fucking hard! You got up and you got out of bed, that’s the first step. Learn to love yourself even through the despair and self-loathing.  There is no one path to overcoming depression, and sometimes it’s not exactly the cure-all you envisioned but rather learning to live with it. But I promise you all that one day, it will be better. You will be happy again. And until then, I’m happy to listen to you if you ever need anyone to talk to or have any questions.",struggled depression anxiety year hi everyone just wanted share experience depression anxiety hope reason going new reddit hope okay struggled severe depression anxiety past year honestly difficult thing dealt with mental illness silently crippling spent night remember wracked sob feeling incredibly alone fantasizing suicide spent day remember feeling hollow apathetic not caring happened me depression fucking bitch now actually feel happy loved excited future not naive think struggle mental health again think learned best cope it medication did not work me believe professional therapy invaluable people struggling mental illness did not make big difference case learned focus present rely loved one lucky have forgive myself small step time not leave room today shit fucking hard got got bed step learn love despair selfloathing path overcoming depression not exactly cureall envisioned learning live it promise day better happy again then happy listen need talk question,0.5879732370376587,0.314859002828598,0.41047897934913635

"The one upside of being depressed I've recently noticed something that has, strangely enough, somehow helped me a bit with my depression.  See, I've started not ""sweating the small stuff."" For example; stuck in traffic? It's okay. Spilled my coffee? Oh, well. My co-worker is annoying? Doesn't phase me.  My thought process is like this: when I wake up and feel like dying, at least the spilled coffee gives me something to do in the mean time.

Hi. My name is Jenna. I'm 20 years old and just joined and figured that I should introduce myself. I found this site from searching online and think that it's great. I only started accepting the fact that I've been depressed last year because I've always been very good at hiding it from everyone else and I used to fool myself as well (if that makes sense). I've never been one to seek help from others because in the past I've always dealt with everything myself. The start of college and being outside (different state) of my home environment (which is the cause of a lot of anger and resentment that I also have) helped me to see that there was something wrong with the way that I was living and that I could reach out and get help. I'm currently seeing a counselor (through my college and since I feel like I'm working well with her that I don't need to seek other outside help yet) about my anxiety and depression but I feel that talking to others that are going through the same thing could help give me a different view on everything and be helpful as well. I'm glad that I stumbled across these forums and I can't wait to get to know some of you.

"I'm a 24 year old female and I am extremely ugly.  Despite having tried a slew of products recommended by dermatologists, and washing religiously, I nonetheless I have the most disgusting skin ever (EVER.  You know Freddy Kreuger?  He suddenly starts to look quite appealing next to me).  And I have ... unfortunate features.  I have a nose that would shame Pinocchio, small eyes, and a manly jaw.  This never used to bother me too much, because I've lived with being Unfortunate Looking my whole life, heard all the insults in school, and I figured that anyone who didn't want to know me because of my appearance wasn't worth my time.

I have lots of friends, and even though I'm forever boyfriend -less, I'm the one that people seem to depend on for everything but sex, and that has always been a comfort to me.  But yesterday, I overheard a friend - a friend! - saying that my skin is ""disgusting"" and I ought to ""do something"" about it.  He said that it was no wonder I was single.  He said it was a ""shame I wanted children so much, since no one would ever want to get close enough to impregnate me"".  The person he was talking to suggested IVF.

"I checked myself in to a Mental Hospital I decided after dealing with months of annoying suicidal ideation that I should go to a mental hospital. I say annoying because I was aware of these increased thoughts and wanted nothing to do with killing myself. While I wanted a closed environment away from home stressors to solve my issues I was also afraid of going somewhere unknown. I went through with it (despite crying and feeling emotional on the way there) to get my life turned around.   I feel very often that horror stories are told of hospitals. In reality, if  you need the help, please seek it out. You may have a completely different experience than someone who claims they don't remember their stay and was drugged up to their eyeballs.   My experience was a pleasant one overall. I went there and focused on fixing my issues and I'd say I came out feeling better. I'm not sure if I can or should give the name of the place but I'm sure someone can let me know down below. I just want to share my experience and help people not feel so afraid of going to one.  The place was pretty clean. An adult area for people 18 and over, rooms and halls split by gender. Bathrooms only seemed a bit off towards the end of the day or during the morning when people would shower. Roommates were sweet and tidy thankfully but the option to change roommates if there was a problem was always available to me. Groups were informative and engaging as well as encouraging for others to speak up if they wished. You had a good amount of personal time to do whatever. Outdoor activities were available permitting the weather. The place was meant for short stays of up to a week so anyone who's still there for longer may see the groups as too repetitive. The food was surprisingly delicious and great. Honestly expected school lunch type of food but there was variety and options for those allergic, vegetarian or needing gluten free food. There were staff members around whenever you needed them for anything.   The treatment team could've been better. They were good to me but not to everyone there. Changed meds without informing me. I went from 5 to 10 to 15mg of Abilify. Good Lord I felt it once I was home. Then REALLY felt it when they made a mistake and I went cold turkey for two weeks because I couldn't get my prescription filled. I'll update once I'm properly back on it.  So that's my experience. After a week, I came out feeling better. I got off of Wellbutrin after determining it could be the cause of my increased depression. The Abilify gives me energy to get up and not be stuck in bed all day. I feel better than when I went in.   I know this is a long post, however I've been afraid of sharing my experience with others. I don't want to feel afraid of ashamed of having went, so here I am with this post.

"First of all, a happy Christmas to one and all. My situation is that I have had moderate depression on and off since 18 years old, and 2 years ago aged 33 I had it so bad I had to be off work for 3 months. Then I tried the SSRI Escitalopram and it worked perfectly and I went back to work. I came off it a year ago and then 4 months ago I suffered a relapse and had to go back on it, and now I am OK (except when it came back for 3 days after a booze bender). My psychiatrist is saying I should take them indefinitely. As I have no side effects I am happy with this, but I am concerned about some reports saying that they start to work less well after some years. Is this right. And if so wouldn't it be better to ration them so I only take them after I relapse? So they keep on working for longer, if not the rest of my life. Is there anyone on the boards here who has been taking antidepressants for many years who has found they have become less effective and now regrets having taken them for that reason. And now suffers depression that now cannot be treated by medication? Yes I've heard that you can switch to others, but surely the same type of reasoning applies? The psychiatrist said that I had endogenous depression with a reactive cause, and that she didn't think that counseling would help. Does this make sense? A former work colleague of mine recently said that the antidepressants had made me start acting ""weird"". Well apart from posting on an internet forum I don't think I've done anything weird, and other friends agree with me. But other friends all think that it is not good for you to keep taking these ""happy pills"" for a long term, that antidepressants are a short term fix only. But what do they know.

My gf is planning on killing herself and idk what to do... Ok so me and her have known each other for 9 months. We are in a long-distance relationship. We have never met in real life. I think she may be bipolar. One night she told me she cut herself a little bit. On her thigh. At first I thought she was joking. She showed me the mark if lefted in the morning and I knew it was serious. She is 16 and I am 18. She has told me before she wants to die. She has had a bad past with men but I won't go into any details. It was just really bad. She doesn't talk to her parents about it just me. Her mother and father may get a divorce so that makes this situation even worse. She can be really happy at times then really down. We get in fights sometimes but they are usually resolved. She always complains she is a bad gf because she treats me like shit. I forgive her for doing so because of her shit life. Today we were just talking casually and a few mins later she said I will kms on said date. Then I told her why would u. She said love u bye. We then went back and forth until I decided to leave her alone. She said she wasn't feeling ok. But I have never heard her give me a date before. Saying you will is one thing but a date means you have planned out how u want to go. I didn't tell my parents the full story and neither has she. She has tried killing herself before. I didn't know her at the time. She doesn't have any friends in real life and the ones she does have just use her. She is also behind in school which stresses her out.

"I lost my father to a sudden and completely unexpected heart attack two weeks ago. I've been up and down, but right now I'm at a loss. What are some strategies you'd employ(secular wise, i'm non religious). I suffer from severe anxiety(GAD) and severe depression. xpost /r/griefsupport I'm going to seek counselling by the way very soon. My Dad's service hasn't happened yet. I was planning after that to start up again but with this added part.  So yeah, my dad showing no signs of it, had a massive heart attack on the 14th and passed away on the 16th at 73 years old. I realize people's times do come, and he had health problems(As far as we knew, no heart disease, had been checked out) but he didn't smoke or drink and he lost a lot of weight and took care of himself for the most part. He was slowing down, but no more then an older person would.  To say it was a shock would be putting it mildly. I ugly cried in front of him and his hospital bed several times. I'm just so broken up for my mom and my family. Of course, me too. But my Mom and Dad were married for 45 years. And although it wasn't perfect, they had a true love. And I have such a close relationship with my mother. So when her heart is breaking it's hard for me to see. I sponge it. I feel that pain.  I've also unfortunately had to deal with siblings who are dealing with this tragedy by lashing out and trying to put themselves ahead of myself and my brother. (My sister and other brother). And that's been super difficult. They've said some ugly things that I'm trying to look past at the current moment.  Anyways, I just wanted to know other then counselling, if there's anything you feel that might be of use to me and my brain to move forward without Dad. Depression has creeped in the last few days with the grief to give it a double whammy. Also had a massive panic attack yesterday as well, which I expected but it never prepares you for it.  Anyways.

"I have my ECT consultation today and I’ve never felt more alone. I have a good support system around me but somehow I’ve never felt more alone than at this moment. Nobody else that I know has had depression as severe as mine, or has ever been in this position where the choices are: be miserable forever, or zap your brain which might seemingly cause permanent memory damage and may not even work after all that.  Last night was the first time I’ve felt really suicidal in a while (mostly I’ve just been miserable and haven’t even been motivated to plan my suicide). Why go through all these awful, invasive treatments when I could just end it quickly and quietly and then everyone else could get back to their lives? I feel like an immense burden.   I’ve been severely depressed for the better part of 2 years at this point. It has totally disabled me, robbed me of a career I loved, and made most things difficult or unbearable. I’ve tried 7 different drugs to try and get it and my anxiety under control. No cigar.   I don’t necessarily want to die, I just don’t want to live, if that makes sense. I feel as if my husband, friends, and doctor are keeping me artificially alive with all these treatments that don’t work, when in reality, I’m that painfully sick dog that needs to just be put down already.   I never thought the potential for another treatment would actually make me more suicidal, but here we are.

"I want a cat so much due to depression and loneliness... I once had a cat I had got for my 16th birthday over 10 years ago before she died at a bit of a young age just almost a year ago. She helped me so much whenever I had suicidal thoughts; when I would get them and tell myself how much I should die, I would think of her, and then ask myself ""Who would take care of her? She would be so devastated if her own master was gone. I could never do that to her.""  But ever since her death, I think I've been more depressed and lonely without her. I've been so much more angry and isolated, I think. I want a furry companion so, so much, but I don't think it will happen anytime soon, no matter how urgent or how much I rather need one, and that makes me even more depressed. There's been so much going on, so it's not a good time to look for a kitten; however, the thing is, I don't know how much longer I have to wait, and I don't know how much longer I \*can\* wait, because my family moved, and the house we live in is being renovated, so I don't even have a room yet. My wild guess is that it could take maybe a year for everything to settle, but I cannot wait that long at all before getting a cat.  I'm torn.

"Hi everyone I am new here. I guess I will start from the top with my story. At the age of 17 I was hospitalized for bipolar disorder which I do not think I have. Anyways I was hospitalized twice medicines worked for a while but then I would just crash down into a further depression. At the age of 18 I stopped all medicines because I was happy and didn't think they were really doing anything to help me. Since that time I still suffer occasional bouts of depression. I will also add in that my mom has schizoaffective disorder and that I have many aunts and uncles with depression. I am now soon to be 26 and I just feel very alone. I am married and I work and go to school right now. I am just overwhelmed I don't want to go to my classes I don't feel like it is worth my time I feel like no one cares if I succeed or fail. I have had these feelings before this is the same way I felt when I dropped out of high school. I just feel worthless the only thing I even enjoy anymore is work and lately that has not given me much enjoyment at all I use to be eager to be there and now I am anxious to get off of work and come home and not do anything. My husband and I have been fighting a lot lately he has an anger problem that we have been trying to work through, and it is negatively impacting the way I feel. I can also tell though that he is worried about me he keeps asking me if I am ok or if I am mad at him I just don't really feel anything right now I am just numb. I just have a million thoughts running through my head and no matter what I do I can't seem to get rid of the negativity. I am tired all the time, yet I can't sleep at night that well but I have been falling asleep in the middle of the afternoons. I overreact to little things and the list goes on. I know what can happen if I let this go on. I nearly lost my life to the negative thoughts when I was younger that is the only reason I got help then. I have decided to see my doctor and get some help I just think I need some support I have no friends around here well at least that have any time to visit and my family is all 2 hours away.

"What Depression is Like For Me. Having depression is like sailing with a hole inside your boat and only a bucket to keep you afloat. Depression is wanting to have friends but are too anxious to go out and stay a while longer. Depression is forcing yourself out of bed, not for yourself but those who count on you. Depression is having an empty feeling inside your chest while your head is crowded with self loathing. Depression is where people tell you ""it will all get better"" but only hearing the silent whispers of the wind. Depression is where you slowly lose your personality, joy, and interest for those things that you have used to love. Depression is where a stranger tells you ""I'll be here for you"" and you take it as an insult.  Depression is where you hurt, crawl on the floor crying, grabbing on to dear life alone in your dark room with your thoughts, too tired to do anything and then go to bed only to rise again to pretend that nothing happened.  To pretend, nothing happened.

My SO has panic disorder and it’s making me depressed. My SO has been diagnosed for now with panic disorder (waiting on health monitor results to check to see if it’s not something else)  The last couple of months have been really hard. He has overtime gotten more worried about his health and every time is convinced that it’s cancer or something else deadly.   He can spend hours on google about a discomfort he feels and freaks out because webmd says it one thing and another site says something else. He checks his heart rate every 15 minutes because he downloaded an app on his phone.   I have taken him to the er multiple times in the past couple of months and each time they say that’s nothing is wrong he’s just having bad panic attacks. He won’t believe them because then he’ll go on reddit and see stories of people being misdiagnosed. I’m convinced he’s a hypochondriac.  We can’t go about one day without him saying he doesn’t feel good. It’s hard to enjoy myself whenever we go out because I’m just waiting for him to say something about not feeling good so we can just leave wherever we’re at.  I don’t know how to fully support him through this.

"I lost a friend I just graduated high school and all throughout high school I have struggled with depression and anxiety. At my school, there was this really cute girl who I had a crush on. She was in two of my classes and I got know her pretty well. Although she was kind of out of my league and I could tell she wasn't into me romantically, I never minded just being her friend because she's really sweet and mature compared to most other people at my school. It made me really happy to spend time with her and made my day so much better at school even if it was just walking in the hall for a few minutes. Most of my mental health issues came from school related things and when I was with her I would totally forget about all that stuff. Unfortunately, sometime towards the end of the school year, she started dating another guy and after that she didn't really seem interested in being my friend. Now it's summer and I've tried to keep in touch with her. I send her snapchats sometimes but she usually leaves me on open. I hate seeing pictures of them together. I want to tell her how I feel and that I wish I could be her friend still but I'm worried it will just create a bad situation. I really don't know what to do.",lost friend just graduated high school high school struggled depression anxiety school really cute girl crush on class got know pretty well kind league tell not romantically minded just friend really sweet mature compared people school really happy spend time day better school just walking hall minute mental health issue came school related thing totally forget stuff unfortunately end school year started dating guy did not really interested friend summer tried touch her send snapchats usually leaf open hate seeing picture together want tell feel wish friend worried just create bad situation really not know do,0.4633864760398865,0.4461783766746521,0.46151646971702576
"I [18F] finally feel like i’m getting better I was diagnosed with depression about 4 years ago. Honestly every single day for the past 5 years I have debated killing myself, I tried a few times but I was unsuccessful. Really I was down in a hole, couldn’t seem to find an escape. My parents tried their best but were at a loss.  Finally, I met A [18 M] last september and we started dating in July. And he has been the most supportive person i have ever met, would take days off of work to take care of me when I was too sad, would help me talk through things, told me why he loved me and that the flaws didn’t matter to him. He is the absolute best and I haven’t even thought about suicide for the past three months.  It gets better, I was really lost, was hoping i would die and I found my cure.

"Had a good dream, then I woke up Last night I had a really good dream. The type of dream that makes you think “fuck it, maybe I won’t kill myself.” I was with someone, probably an s/o, and there wasn’t anything going on but everything was at peace. Then my grandmother woke me up for a breakfast that everyone argued over, even with a goddamn three year old. Nothing changed, I just had a bullshit dream that’ll never really happen.

"How are you? I am not okay. I’m in a kind of adverse situation, my thoughts are all over the place and I really don’t know how to break this cycle. Basically what happened was that a few days ago, I sent my best friend a message before school, saying that I wouldn’t attend classes because I wasn’t feeling too well, that I felt like giving up and that, in case I also wouldn’t have been at school the following day, I had probably killed myself. I wasn’t joking. Sometimes I get these sort of “impulses”, most likely caused by me being overwhelmed by my emotions, my thoughts, and as a result of that, it feels as though I lose my common sense, my ability to think rationally. My thought patterns become unpredictable, but so far I’ve managed to not act on them, or else I wouldn’t be writing this right now. Currently they’ve been happening a lot more frequently than usual and that seriously freaks me out because during those times death seems like such a good solution to my problems. So, back to the story. Obviously, my friend got really concerned and encouraged me to come to her place because she’d been staying at home that day. BUT she also contacted my mom, which I didn’t know until hours later, and told her that I wasn’t at school and made a concerning remark, but I don’t know exactly. My mom started to call me like every minute and I started to panic because I thought a teacher had called her, so I didn’t pick up any of her calls. I spent the rest of the day with my friend, but called my mom in the afternoon. She asked my where I was and it sounded like she was crying and I told her that I was at my friends place, but after that she declined the call. That night I slept at my dads place, my mom called him and told him that she didn’t care anymore about what I was doing and that kind of hit me. It was the last thing I wanted to hear in that situation. I just don’t know what to do. I really do feel miserable. My friend is beating herself up because she thinks it’s all her fault and I don’t know, I just feel bad for feeling bad, if you know what I mean. That message was a cry of help in a kind of way and I don’t understand why my mom reacted the way she did. It just makes me think that maybe everyone is really better off without me. I’ve been depressed for nearly five years now, but my mom never really paid attention to it and just marked me down as lazy. I’ve been doing great for a good six months in 2017, but then somebody really important to me, somebody that kept me going, passed away in December and since then everything had taken a turn for the worse. Life has become so hard for me, I’m sleeping the days away because I can’t bear the thoughts, the guilt, because I’m too much of a coward to face reality. I’m trying, I really am, but no matter what I do, this feeling, this feeling that eradicates my will to live, remains.",you not okay kind adverse situation thought place really not know break cycle basically happened day ago sent best friend message school saying not attend class not feeling well felt like giving that case not school following day probably killed myself not joking sort impulse likely caused overwhelmed emotion thought result that feel lose common sense ability think rationally thought pattern unpredictable far managed not act them not writing right now currently happening lot frequently usual seriously freak time death like good solution problem so story obviously friend got really concerned encouraged come place staying home day contacted mom did not know hour later told not school concerning remark not know exactly mom started like minute started panic thought teacher called her did not pick call spent rest day friend called mom afternoon asked sounded like cry told friend place declined call night slept dad place mom called told did not care anymore doing kind hit me thing wanted hear situation just not know do really feel miserable friend beating think fault not know just feel bad feeling bad know mean message help kind way not understand mom reacted way did just make think maybe really better me depressed nearly year now mom really paid attention just marked lazy doing great good month somebody really important me somebody kept going passed away december taken turn worse life hard me sleeping day away bear thought guilt coward face reality trying really am matter do feeling feeling eradicates live remains,0.43521326780319214,0.41793158650398254,0.5897381901741028
"I guess I am writing because I don't know how to think or feel at this period. I feel that I have hurt a lot of people by having my depression, especially my parents. I haven't phoned them in 2 weeks, I just don't have the courage to talk to them. I guess they feel that I blame them for my condition. Same with my remaining 2 sisters. Dang what a situation I have put myself in!  I still have a group of friends that like me a lot, but I haven't told them about suffering from depression. I hide it inside and either act in anxious way or I do solitary activities such as write poems, play the piano or swim.  I guess the main embuggerance is that I finding the third year of my course a real struggle at the best of times, but having understanding tutors and talking to doctors that have depression help.  I don't know why things have turned out the way things are, why I struggle with anything remotely challenging, but I guess that will never be explained. Sometimes i feel frustrated with the way things have turned and I can do very little to change the current of of my present situation.  I feel kind of sick with stuff at the moment. Not that I am assuming a victim complex, but just that in all the poems I write about, I always seek a sanctuary from the business aspect of life, you know the dog eat dog, go compete with others to get a job and survive for the next 55 years of my projected lifespan. Yeah pretty heady thoughts I'm having!  I guess I'm just scared of the future. I don't know how to survive, I kind of want to blank the future out. I guess all in all, I want to live a simple life and be decent to others. I would like the people I meet in the future to say hey that Haymond guy was a splendid fellow who really loved people and would go out of his way to help them, because he could.   But than an inner anxiety knows that I have hurt people from withdrawing into myself and by depression's virtue being too self indulgent. That hurts the most, knowing I hurt people from my depression. I never intended to harm anyone or be this way. If I could smile and be happy I would, but I can only show the scars of my mental pain as a testament to self torment.  Don't get me wrong, I smile sometimes and even rejoice in the company of those friends in normal health, but I guess I feel rejected. Self rejection and by that of the stigma of the people of the same age I encounter on campus and at home.  I want this to stop I guess. I want a placebo pill that will transport me to the Elysium fields, because sometimes reality is a bugger to experience. I guess the main message is that I want respite from this life, some form of relief and rest, where I will achieve or obtain this elusive elixir of peace. But I'm here, still standing, still finding a lot of life a challenge, still merging into a crowd of people who are too proud to admit that sometimes things may be too much.  Who am I and what am I doing here ... I haven't a faintest clue. Yeah, I'm scared of defeat, of a battered ego that even a shred of self esteem that I had will be allowed to fly in the fresh wind.  Its sounds like I'm asking for love ... I guess I am. Also that I would love some help, and in no small measure I have requested that help from doctors and therapists and talked to you my dear friends. But I find it extremely hard to help myself, to make amends with the very mind that hurts me so.  I don't know what to think is what I wrote at the top of the blog, now seems apt to include it in the conclusion. I guess spilling my emotions has made me feel somewhat dizzy!  I guess I will wander, spinning round in circles until I get what the whole dang thing of life is all about.

"My best is not enough. Ok, so here is the situation: I broke up with my ex five months ago. As soon as we ended our thing, I started running everyday, eating healthy food only, and going to the gym. 1h30min of HEAVY exercise everyday. I did this until this very day. I lost fucking 15kg (my weight at the start was 90kg, now 75kg). I also bought green contact lenses to wear, and even sunbathe. I invested so much time (and money) to improve myself and look amazing and no. one. noticed.! I look at the mirror and I am happy with my results. Then, the moment I exit my house:BOOM. 4 months thrown into the trash. No one cares. It makes no difference.  The women I'm attracted still do not find me attractive. It pisses me off how I imagine they won't survive just one week of my training. They can't see how hard I worked to change. I downloaded Tinder,even saw my EX there, wrote a BIO describing myself (I still find myself interesting. People, don't) and I got nearly 0 matches. Now I'm stuck in an Alcohol /Cigarette/Party/OneNightStandGirls loop and I can't get out of it. I drink so much that I can't even remember some things. I have fun, yes.

"Here's my answer to your age question. Sadly, I am 29 years old: sniffle1: Don't get me wrong. I don't want to be completely alone for the rest of my life. There's a sentimental part of me that yearns for companionship with a guy, but I have such a tall hurdle to overcome before I can even get to that yet. Yeah, but I can relate to the peace and quiet thing by myself. It really is such a luxury nowadays (personally speaking). One thing I reflected on was that I live in a family of 8 people, and maybe that's why I feel so claustrophobic and irritable around lots of people. Essentially, there's no secure privacy, really. Yup, like you I used to live independently when I went to school. I'm on a bit of a break right now, but will go back in September where I'll share an apartment with a roommate I don't know. Right now, I'm mooching off my parents' food and shelter. At age 29, I feel like a little child. And by the way, I'm unemployed too. I tried all summer to land a job, but in vain. I only worked one day for Elections Canada, and that was it. Oh well, a paycheck is a paycheck, right? The thing is, I can't stand living with somebody I hardly know either. Sometimes I just don't want to greet somebody at breakfast, or say a polite 'hello, how are you, or how was your day?"". When I battle depression and social anxiety, I really really need the comfort of familiar people around me at times. The last thing I need is a complete stranger sharing my quarters. But, it's something I can't help. I'll probably isolate myself in my room for a while. At least I get cable TV and the internet. Then again, I'll probably become a complete hermit during the school year.",answer age question sadly year old sniffle not wrong not want completely rest life sentimental yearns companionship guy tall hurdle overcome yet yeah relate peace quiet thing myself really luxury nowadays personally speaking thing reflected live family people maybe feel claustrophobic irritable lot people essentially secure privacy really yup like used live independently went school bit break right now september share apartment roommate not know right now mooching parent food shelter age feel like little child way unemployed too tried summer land job vain worked day election canada it oh well paycheck paycheck right thing is stand living somebody hardly know either just not want greet somebody breakfast say polite hello you day battle depression social anxiety really really need comfort familiar people time thing need complete stranger sharing quarter but help probably isolate room while cable tv internet again probably complete hermit school year,0.38253313302993774,0.3220478594303131,0.49475032091140747

"Depressed? Or Just in a Bad Rut? (Long Post) I've never really felt like I've had depression before. I'm turning 24 at the end of the week, and this is the first time I've honestly wondered about myself. Usually, I'm pretty happy about things, and my outlook on life has always been realistically positive. But, lately, I just feel absolutely lost. And this morning, after I got off of work, I sat and cried. I'm not much of crier at all, and the only other time I've cried in the last ten years has been at an uncle's funeral recently.   This past summer, for me, was a pretty great time. I was in a relationship with a girl who really made me happy, more than any other one had before. I seemed to be having fun every weekend, whether with her or with some friends of mine or family. I had a lot on the horizon, and a lot to look forward to. I was getting ready to finish up my degree, and it seemed like things were going in the right direction. The only thing that was a problem then was that my job was a third shift job, but it was 3 days a week, and usually 11-13 hour shifts, meaning I had time to do stuff outside of it. But, my then girlfriend and another friend had solid connections that they thought could help me land a much better job where they worked, which would carry me pretty well until I finished school. Things were looking up for me. I was pretty happy.   I guess things started to slip for me when my uncle got hit with a terminal diagnosis in August. At 47, and with young children, nobody in the family was prepared to lose him. And the disease, an incredibly rare degenerative brain disease, was the same one that killed my grandmother 11 years ago. We lost him in early September. The thing with this disease that nobody in the family is talking about is that, if it hits twice within the same bloodline, there's a 50% chance that living relatives within the bloodline will get it in their 40's or 50's. There's nine of us left in the immediate family, including my mother, my brother and myself. And since it's so rare, there is absolutely no treatment plan.   That, for me, was a lot to process. I'm not worried about myself, but the idea that I could still be losing relatives to this disease for years sucks. It's hard enough seeing it happen twice.   During this time, things started to fall apart with me and my then-girlfriend as well. I kind of hid out with her for a while, because my family was perpetually sad and in a state of distress. And since I worked nights, I was kind of isolated. Things started to hit a rut between me and her when she started her own treatment for depression. I tried to be supportive of her, while doing whatever anyone in my family needed while my uncle was sick. She really seemed happy that I was there for her, (and things really worked out since she lived so close to my uncle anyways, and I could bounce back and forth from place to place on my days off.)  Both my family and my girlfriend were very important to me, and I guess helping them out made me feel good about myself, even though the situation was shitty. I kind of let school fall to the back-burner though. And I kind of neglected my other friends for a while as well. But between work, my family, and her, I was consistently busy.   My uncle passed in early September, sending most of my family into a pretty bad state, and only a week later, my girlfriend decided she was done with me, because she was afraid that if she recovered from her depression with me around, then she'd equate me with happiness, and if I left her then she wouldn't be able to recover. (Which ended up being mostly a made up way of saying, I don't love you anymore, but I don't have the courage to tell you.) Obviously, it wasn't fair to her to be stuck with me if she wasn't happy with me, but there were so many better opportunities for her to break things off, and she chose the one that was the most tedious and mentally draining for me. My state of mind after it ended wasn't great at all, and I said some very mean things to her after it ended, (I guess, at the time, I thought it was constructive criticism, but it was all just mean and awful and embarrassing.) Understandably, she hasn't talked to me since, and I feel like I burned any bridge towards reconciling with her.  I missed my uncle a lot, but doing favors for his wife and kids helped me at least feel like I was contributing. My mother's still kind of a mess about it, but she has my father for support. My brother had a hard time for a while too, but his job keeps him well occupied. But, lately, for me, the things I can help with anymore have been fewer and fewer.   Right now, I just want to fast forward to like March or April. I don't want to deal with my birthday, since the plans I had with my ex-girlfriend are obviously not happening anymore, most of my friends are busy with work and school, and my family is still not back to being normal. Nobody seems to want to do much for my birthday anyways, which is, for lack of a better word, normal for me. When I got home from work this morning, I cried thinking about it all. I've never had that kind of emotional reaction to anything before.   The only thing I look forward to in life at the moment is my night or two out with a friend a week. The holidays are going to be rough on my family, I know now that my ex girlfriend (who I still care for and would probably take back) has completely moved on from me, and the once promising prospect of a new job isn't nearly as likely as it used to be. And, school kind of got caught up in the shuffle, and I'm not where I wanted to be with that, either. I'm going to be out on my own come January, which might help, but right now I'm just dreading the next month. I feel like the things I care about are slipping further and further out of my control, and it's hard for me to deal with.  I don't know if this is just a rough patch in my life, or a sign that I have a more serious problem. But right now, I have very few people that I can be 100% open with, and it's been tough. Work is, for lack of a better word, quiet for me, meaning I spend most of my time thinking, and it doesn't help much. Since I've never really had a stretch like this before where I've been as mentally drained and just sad, I'm not really sure what to do. But there's very little on the horizon that I'm looking forward to, and I'm worried about that.   tl;dr: Stretch of life events, most of which out of my control, have wreaked havoc on my emotional state. I now feel kind of hopeless. Don't know if it's just a rough patch in life, or something worse.

"I want to share my experience moving to NYC from Israel - four months ago Hello everyone,     I just thought it would do good for me to share my experience moving to this city among other new yorkers and maybe hearing some new voices of people who are living here and know better than me or even went through the same thing.      So basically, I'm 28 years old and moved to NYC four months ago with my wife. My wife is doing her Ph.D. at Columbia University, and I just joined her (with a work permit during our stay here), and we are going to be here for at least 3.5 years, but we could choose to stay for five years if we wish to. (At the moment I don't see it happening)      I have to say that moving here has been the most difficult challenge I've ever been through in my life. First, though my English is not bad at all, I'm SO, SO insecure about it. I'm feeling afraid to open my mouth and say complicated things, and it is depressing me. (I am a person who's talking a lot by nature. I've always been like that) And I feel like someone took away that ability from me and I'm much less charismatic in English than in Hebrew which affects my confidence tremendously... After smoking weed for 4-5 years almost every day in Israel, I quit doing it since the first month I got here only because it made me feel very anxious (it used to make me feel quite the opposite before)      I used to be a teacher in Israel and pretty quickly I've found a job as a teacher that teaches Hebrew here in New York. (In Israel I used to teach History which I found much more interesting than teaching a language, but that's what I got here, so I have to live with that) A few days ago, I had a conversation with my boss, and apparently, they are pleased by my work there, and they asked me if I am willing to continue for next year which is nice to hear even though I don't like this job that much. I guess I will have to compromise.       My wife and I are supported by an excellent scholarship, and we don't have to worry a lot about money or health insurance so, on the financial field, we are kinda covered. But being here makes me feel powerless. Obviously, I don't have my good friends here with me, and I feel much less ""special"" as a person. I feel like I am only one among millions who are trying to survive in this big hectic city. In the beginning, I thought it is beautiful that this city is full of people from all around the world, but now it just feels to me that everyone are strangers to each other and it seems like it is the loneliest city in the world at the moment.       And because I don't have friends here and I am married (so meeting with girls on tinder etc. is not an option) I don't have many reasons to leave the house and it is kinda sad. The only reasons I'm leaving my house is for yoga classes, work, and restaurants with my wife. Other than that I don't have any other reasons to leave the house... The weather is fucking horrible, and it is so cold it is painful to me being outside.       Anyways, I don't expect from you guys to be my therapist or giving me some life-changing advices... I guess I post this to release some steam. So if you managed to read my post until the end, Thank you :) And I hope things will improve for me. I've always lived in Israel and only left for trips. The longest was 3-4 months, and I have never relocated my life to anywhere else. So maybe it is just a matter of time until I will start to feel more like home here. If you have anything to share from your experience, that would be lovely just to know that I am not the only one who is going through this adjustment period.       Thanks again for reading and for your patience. Have a great week everyone",want share experience moving nyc israel month ago hello everyone just thought good share experience moving city new yorkers maybe hearing new voice people living know better went thing basically year old moved nyc month ago wife wife doing phd columbia university just joined with work permit stay here going year choose stay year wish to at moment not happening say moving difficult challenge life first english not bad all so insecure it feeling afraid open mouth say complicated thing depressing me i person talking lot nature like that feel like took away ability charismatic english hebrew affect confidence tremendously smoking weed year day israel quit doing month got feel anxious it used make feel quite opposite before used teacher israel pretty quickly job teacher teach hebrew new york in israel used teach history interesting teaching language got here live that day ago conversation bos apparently pleased work there asked willing continue year nice hear not like job much guess compromise wife supported excellent scholarship not worry lot money health insurance so financial field kinda covered make feel powerless obviously not good friend me feel special person feel like million trying survive big hectic city beginning thought beautiful city people world just feel stranger like loneliest city world moment not friend married so meeting girl tinder etc not option not reason leave house kinda sad reason leaving house yoga class work restaurant wife not reason leave house weather fucking horrible cold painful outside anyways not expect guy therapist giving lifechanging advice guess post release steam managed read post end thank hope thing improve me lived israel left trip longest month relocated life else maybe just matter time start feel like home here share experience lovely just know not going adjustment period thanks reading patience great week,0.3403186500072479,0.47363781929016113,0.42784538865089417

"Embarrassing myself at volleyball tryouts I'm a freshman in high school and we just did volleyball tryouts and they were fucking horrible. I had to wake up at 5:30 to go to them because they started at 6. Literally everyone there was better than me. I fucking hate everything. I'm such a failure. Like everyone was doing actual spikes and sets and shit and I was just there. They probably thought I was in special ed. At least if I had a mental disability I would have an excuse to be so shit at volleyball. I'm probably gonna quit tbh. I've never wanted to die more in my life.

"Unrequited Love Crept Back Up to Haunt Me First off, I felt the need to create this fake reddit account so that my posts could not be linked to my actual reddit account, and I could vent to reddit without worrying that any of my family or friends will read this.  Unrequited love is the worst. It consumes your mind almost every second of every day.   I'm usually a positive person (at least I try to be). Grew up with this girl in the church. We were the best of friends. In high school, we went to homecoming and senior ball together. I asked her out 3 times, once in middle school, once in freshman year, and once in senior year, all three times given the response ""I'm sorry, I don't like you in that way.""  It messed me up. Even affected my first two relationships. I got with my first girlfriend solely because she liked me. Part of me hoped my best friend would get jealous. I genuinely liked my second girlfriend and she liked me. This girl gave me the butterflies, but because neither of us made a real effort to be boyfriend and girlfriend, we didn't last. Before, after, and sometimes during each of these relationships, I would wish it was my best friend (I know, a dick move).   Then I messed up. I was influenced by a terrible person to say some things I shouldn't have. We went to the same community college like we planned but three years passed without ever seeing each other because we were fighting.  The time that we spent apart allowed me to clear my head. Before, I used to think about her all the time. Now, days, even weeks would pass without her crossing my mind. I met plenty of people in college and made tons of good friends, focused on my hobbies, it was the happiest I've been.   Eventually, we got tired of fighting and I realized what it was that I fucked up: an extremely good friendship. After I made an effort to show how sorry I was, she made an effort to let me back into her life. Then I thought, ""Don't fuck this up. She doesn't need you to like her. She needs you to be a good friend."" I said some harsh things, and because of it, we weren't friends for 2 to 3 years. So naturally, we tried making up for the time we had lost.   She invited me to hang with her friends. I invited her to hang with mine. We would do things together, play music together, video games together, and just genuinely hang out. We talked things over and settled our fight by blaming that terrible person that we both dislike from before.  We eventually went to the same university together and some of her closest friends became great friends of mine. We took a class together. Would exercise together. And we've gotten to the level of ""No judgment"" as she calls it, where I've told her some of my deepest, darkest secrets, and she did the same with me.   Problem is, as we spend each week almost always hanging out 3 or 4 days out of the week. I find it harder to come to terms with us never being together. She's never dated, but she tells me about guys she's liked, little things that happened to her like small romantic contact like ""holding hands"". She has A LOT of guy friends that she's close with, and a few girl friends that she's really close with. And though it only bothered a little back then, it's something I'm jealous of now. Each time I see her, I first think to myself ""be normal, be funny, don't show any signs that you may still have feelings"" and it works.  I'm happy with the way things are, us spending lots of time together, hanging out at each other's houses for hours, trying different foods, and just having someone like her I can talk to.   But thinking about the guy she who will eventually be her first boyfriend, or her husband whom she may have kids with, that future where another guy becomes the guy she sings with, dances with, goes to church with, does romantic stuff with just pains me to think about.   Well, it's late (like 3 in the morning) and this is the time when I'm usually in my feelings. If you've invested time to reading my story this far, I thank you and would like to know what you think about my situation. I'm a bit dramatic, and I overthink like a muthafucka, but I'm an honest fellow, and this is first time venting to reddit. And it's a bit ironic, cuz I should get some sleep since she's coming over tomorrow.   P.S. I thought about solutions like slowly drifting apart from her, but I've come to the realization that I would rather have her in my life as a friend than not at all. But it still hurts.

I have been overwhelmed by the enormity of change and possibility, fallen to my knees, bowed my head beneath our roof, and prayed in earnest that it will not be the last.

"Hi I am trying to get a grip back on my life. My mental health has cost me my marriage. My husband just couldn't handle it anymore. I was hospitalized five times in April and May for suicidal attempt and thoughts. He was there every day for me but felt abandoned by me. As he said through tears ""he couldn't save me"". After the hospitalizations I was really needy. He married a strong and independent woman. In Sept I took myself off my medicines and went into a rage and accused him of cheating on me. That broke his heart and his spirit...he left. Of course, I went into a tailspin. Finally got of the couch last weekend, three months later. I stopped my counseling and medicines.

"Well, I have to admit that as a male I've always viewed my own depression as personal weakness. I still do, I can't help it ...it's a notion, feeling or philosophy or whatever that's been instilled from an early age. I know this is not a popular or realistic way to feel about depression. I mean, it's an illness, right. I've never been to a doctor to have my condition properly diagnosed or treated. At the moment, I really can't face my doctor with that sort of issue (btw, I'm in my mid-40s and I've suffered from depression since as long as i can remember) - I've learned to cope, in a fashion, but probably at the expense of a reasonable sense of social 'normality'- i.e. divorced, emotionally empty relationships, enormous amounts of time spent alone, dissatisfied working life, etc. One covers up & disguises the depression at work, at home, and wherever/whenever necessary...and then, when you're all alone, the demons can come out to play(or even before you're alone) - but at least you maintain the expected external masculine dignity, most of the time. For example, today my son wanted to come over to visit me but because I've been feeling so miserable and morbid and soaked in ennui this week, I made an excuse to put off his visit because I didn't want him to see me feeling low & depressed(and weak) and thus ruining his day/week. Instead, I went out on a freezing 10 mile walk alone to try to physically squash the depression. This is a regular occurrence - I get depressed, I hate myself for being weak, so I do something physical to try to alleviate the symptoms(and also to punish myself for feeling depressed)... it works...temporarily. In my mind, this sort of masochism is (or has been)preferable to taking alcohol, drugs (even prescribed medicines), fags, therapy or inflicting real self-harm and so forth because, at least, it keeps me feeling physically fit-physically balanced(and I guess that's important to me) even if it's not always an effective cure for one's depression. And I can keep up the public pretence that all is well. Sorry, back to the point - yes, it seems a lot of men do tend to suffer depression in silence (one wonders what the real percentage could be!).When I joined this group yesterday it was the first time I'd openly voiced the notion that I DO suffer from depression.

"I think you guys might understand this. I was walking with a close friend after having lunch together, and I told her, ""I feel as if I'm living on borrowed time.""  She asked me to explain further, but I couldn't find the words to better express that perspective.  She then proceeded to recount to me all of the myriad ways she's nearly died on some of the trips she's taken.  I confessed that I couldn't really relate to those sorts of situations or how they've affected her, as she has more zeal for life than anyone I've ever met.  Whatever she was describing about perceived proximity to death didn't suit me.  Then the words came to me.

"I've always resented my mom for being emotionally abusive growing up and blamed her for my depression. But I just told her I'm depressed and she responded in the most perfect way. I feel really weird. I'm an adult now (24) and have had crippling depression since childhood. Growing up, I never had emotional support or love. I was called names and my mom took out her relationship/life issues on me. I was distant from both my parents. I've hugged my mom only once in my life. This is just one issue out of many that led to me developing a fragile self esteem and crippling depression. Over the years, with distance, we started to talk- like once a month or so. The more educated I became, the more I came to understand why she acted the way she did (although I still harbor much resentment) I'm going through a depressive episode just now. I feel so alone and I texted her out of desperation. I told her I felt alone and depressed and couldn't get out of bed to study. Instead of judging me or saying something mean....she just listened to everything and all of my symptoms. She said that she felt so sorry for me and she wished she could help me. And she told me to never feel alone because she loves me and I'm very important to her. She asked if she could do anything to help me...and I realized, yeah, if we could call each other every morning, I could have someone to talk to and tell her about my daily goals. Then I could feel more motivated to get out of bed and feel less alone that day. I just feel weird, because I don't have a relationship with her. I'm scared it's going to be awkward, but I'm desperate for any support I can get right now. I also still resent her, but at the same time understand. I don't know. It's just weird.  But, I'm happy she acted this way, for sure.     Edit: I also don't mean to brag or anything like that.

"""I used to be you"" ""It gets better"" ""You have to love yourself first"" &amp; other lies Not even sure if I should post in this sub, but..     To the people who *used to* suffer from depression, from trauma, from anxiety, from whatever made you miserable, I'm not you.       You were once miserable, like me, you saw no light at the end of the tunnel, but then, you didn't give up. *Something* happened. Now you're happier, now you've got your happy ending, now you've got people who love you for who you are. But I'm not you.       You probably changed, you probably were capable of change, were strong enough to change yourself even. I'm not you.      I've been gone for a long time, now. There is nobody here but bad habits and terrible feelings. Sometimes I feel a semblance of someone who just wanted to make other people happy and be loved, but I think the misery just piled on like miles of permafrost.       I can't blame people for not loving me, but I do blame them for lying to me. Don't they know it hurts more to say 'I care' when they don't, and it takes me much too long to figure it out? How am I ever supposed to trust people when they say they care if it's been such a common lie? The worst part is, *nobody can prove it, because nobody can help me, because nobody knows how or wants to*, I don't know. I've been asking for help for a long time now but nobody takes me seriously.      You, who says that I shouldn't give up. Why? I'm not you. Years from now I will *not* be surrounded by people who love me, I will *not* be anywhere closer to happiness, I will *not* find anyone who loves me. If that person exists, and perhaps they do, I will *not* ever have the luck to meet them.       You tell me I have to love myself before anyone else will. Those who grow in complete solitude don't even learn a human language. So tell me, if there is nobody to show me how to, how do you expect me to teach myself to love myself? I think you just want to place the blame on me. I don't 'love' myself and so that's why I am miserable. Not because of depression, not because of isolation, not because of poverty, not because of heartbreak, it's because I don't love myself in a world that's only taught me to hate and criticize myself. In this world where the people I thought I could perhaps give my heart to, say 'I care about you' and then show me those words are meaningless.      Forgive me for being skeptical about getting better when I've only seen my life decline since it began. I'm not even asking for pity, because I know it's just the luck of the draw and I was dealt a particularly shitty hand. But can you please understand that not all of us are going to be okay in the end? Just because you suffered for many years and I've suffered for many years and you no longer suffer like you used to, doesn't mean I'm not going to continue suffering as I always have been.

I feel like i need him to survive. Every time we have come close to breaking up, it ends up me begging him not to leave. We live together which makes things harder. I have no friends left because i was so dependant on him and they got sick of me not seeing them.

"I went to this meeting. It was for people who have depression. The leader said to me that I was so knowledgeable I should be well. I was very sick at the time.  Which went to show me I had knowledge but no wisdom. For years I knew this. I read all the books and nothing changed. I really felt like maybe I was on the wrong line of thought to get over the depression. Yet I did feel better. I thought my life isn't changing though.  I have so many hopes and dreams for my life and here I am sitting around wasting it. I still feel like that at times but then something bad happened and I didn't react to it. I didn't feel worse. Then someone did something stupid and I didn't yell at them. I went to a friend and asked if she thought I was getting better. Her answer was. Hell Yeah. You bother to talk to me now. It seems she was doing all the talking at one stage. I didn't know.  It's been 10 years since I first got depressed In all the tests on the computer it went from severe depression to moderate the other day I got mild depression. Ok today its back to moderate. I think the reason for this is that I'm nearly there with a thought process and I just can't get it. I'm kicking myself for it for being incompetent and those words from that woman came back you have all this knowledge you should be better. Do I need to go back and do some stuff on self esteem again? Is this what this is about. I look inside of me and see my self esteem has fallen apart again ......... and I mean again!

Far too late in the relationship I realized that this person may not have my best interests in hand. So I left the hospital but I left beaten.

"I was sexually, physically, and emotionally abused by my father, my uncle and my grandparents from the time I was five until I was fifteen. My mother had taken my father and his family to court for it but everyone said that she made me say it to get back at my father, since I was ""only five"" and ""not old enough to know anything."" None of them were punished for it and I had to keep seeing them on visitations until I was sixteen (i'm still sixteen) and I told my dad I didn't want to see him anymore. This obviously did not make him happy and he knows it is about the abuse. Every once and awhile he emails me or calls and tries to make me feel guilty about it and when he does I get upset all over again just when I had started to seem to get better. I really wanted to write a book about my life, but I figured that because my dad and his family wasn't punished or proven guilty that I'd be sued for it. I want to change my last name and then get a pen name, but my mom says I have to wait until I am eighteen. I don't exactly want to wait that long to write my book, but I feel like I don't have a choice. I've considered taking them back to court but I figured it's probably hopeless and I feel guilty and doubtful even though I know it happened. Anyways, I don't want to put my mom through all that again. A lot of times I think that I imagined it all and deny it because I wish it didn't happen. I really want to be a writer and to help people who've been abused, but without proving my abusers guilty I feel as if this is impossible, that it isn't my right. I'm scared they'd be found innocent and then try to kill me for taking them to court. What should I do? I know everyone here is having a hard time and I really don't mean to be a bother.

"A bad relationship and my current state of mind I'm 21 and i'm going to share some of my experience.   So, i meet this girl on the internet in my later 17's , i was an active practitioner of Karate Kyokushin, Muay Thai and Box back then, i was about to enter in the amateurs and start to compete, i even went to japan 2 times on the championship and training grounds.  Then, i meet this one girl , i had just left an relationship with another girl that end up with her cheating on me and well..i was even younger than now and i knew it how to fight, so..I beat the crap out of the guy and was disgusted by woman and by fighting like that again , i was so frustrated that i was traded by a 14 old boy (geez) but i overcome that.  When i meet this girl (I'd call her Kim from now on) i was clear about all that situation and that i was not up for a relationship with her or anyone else.   She was earning a place in my heart because Kim seems so different from other girls and was treating me well, she respected my hobbies, my dreams (it was 5 months to 18 years and i was going to join the military because IT WAS MY DREAM) and myself as a ''man''.  So, she visited me, i visited her, we were 2 states of distance of each other, but ''never too far to our love don't reach each other'' bullshit (387 Miles) and of couse we started to dating and have sex, and all the vows of love, you guys know what i'm talking..   Then i was on my 18, i had finished a test if i was join the military as a seargent or if i was enter like a corporal and I WAS SUCEED \o/ . But on the other hands, Kim, that i had met 6 months ago was  through a rough part of her life, she had lost her job, she wasn't paying the bills and was about to get dumped from the house she was living (all alone) and then, i talked to my parents if i could help her by inviting her to come home with us, i was about to change my life, i was about to work twice as hard and so i did.   I called her and say ''Hey, just sell your things, don't worry about it, we're gonna buy new ones baby'' Hell yea, like a fucking Alpha and she was so happy and she cried and she was all ''omg i love u so much'' Then i left all my trainings hobbies which gives me a lot of stress but i had back then a ''major reason '' for that and i was happy with her.  Then Kim's past started to show up to us. A family of 5, me, my little brother, my mom and dad and now Kim.  The thing is, Kim had a daughter that was with her aunts back then and she started to say she missed her, she was sad, she was feeling bad because she couldn't find a job yet (3 months had passed, it was a rough time on the Brazil enonomically speaking)but HEY, i had 2 jobs and i wouldn't give up, she was sad that i had to work so hard to :  1- Help my parents  2- ""Pay"" For her in the house.  I was saving money too, because other than spending money with that 2  things i didn't have the time to do other things so some free time i had we would watch a movie, take some ice cream, have sex (a lot, geez) and that money that i was saving began to get bigger and bigger, till the point that i was thinking about buying some ground to maybe started to build our own house in the future when she get a job and started to help me .  We would visit Kim's daughter from time to time and i start to love the girl, she was do damn smart but had a sadness in her that i could see, and one day in the house of Kim's Aunt, Her aunt came to me alone with Kim in the grocery store and started to say that i should stop my relationship with her.  I was shocked by the comment, but cold as ice in the outside and just asked 'wth are u talking about ?"" then she started to say that Kim had beat her daughter so damn hard that almost killed her and that's why she was not with Kim anymore and she say Kim it's fckng crazy and all type of shit and i was pissed off.   When we get back to home , i say to Kim what her aunt has spoken and she started to cry (and i was worried) and telled me a story (that isn't even worth bring it here for u guys) that in fact was another person who beat her daughter.   Well, time had passed, we didn't talked about it anymore and we were hanging out and she turns to me and say ""What about we did a lil shot ? "" (That is the equivalent on Brazilian to ""LET'S SMELL COCAINE)i was ""What ?"" and she ""Yea, it will be fun, i will let you do it in my sexy belly if you want"" . It's unbelievable how someone so damn pretty and hot and smart and intelligent and perfect could turn into a fucking piece of shit so god damn fast.  I refuse the ''offer'' and started to yell at her and started to talk some monstruous shit about it, like ""it was because of that you daughter almost died ?"" and everything, i was pissed off, sayed some shits that i shouldn't , she say it too but we overcome it.   So, i was with Kim about 2 years by now AND THEN SHE FINALLY GETS A JOB. we had moved on from my parents house a long time ago but i was not happy because Kim's past started to bother me.   In that time i discovery somethings new about her (with 100% sure before you ask) :  1- She did sex for money , even when she knew me and just talked to me back then.  2- Her ex was a asshole that was aprisioned .  3- She lied as fuck to me about almost everything, her life, her family (like ""my dad is dead"" type of lie), her past, her path.   But this is past RIGHT ? right ? maybe i should just 'fuck off' and get back to my parents house but love is a sick joke.  Let's advance some months (10), we had a baby. She is the reason that i'm here typing this now for you guys read it, because if not, it was for me being burned in hell for suicide.   She of couse, hid the pregnancy , tried to abort EVEN WITH ME BEING BY HER SIDE, lied to me about birth control pills yea, but fuck it i was a man and i for sure wouldn't let my daughter be aborted , she then tried to give her for adoption and was all about ""she will trouble us, our life"" and i was about to kick her out from the house get my baby and that's it. My parents started to help me but the damage was made it already and it was about to get worst.  She was my bride and guess what ? Yea, she cheat on me.  I understand that sometimes i was a dick but man i was not up to be a cuck. I went crazy again, but i controled myself, i send her back to her state with 2 K of money from my own (she quited her job with 2 months of pregnancy ) . I was so god damned hurt. Cheat on me with my best friend cliché ? Wow. Then i started to think about it, he had a great body because he almost live in the gym because he didn't work and didn't have a family . But she doing that ? That hurt me a lot more than he doing it. And i was only 20 back there. She find another guy, and seems like I 'm now the aprisioned guy addicted to drugs (like her aunt had telled me ) you know ? I'm so fucking sad. I loved this girl so fucking much , i wish so fucking much to had a life with her, with her daughter, with my daughter. She left and didn't even ask about our daughter. You know how sad this is ?  On the other hand, i'm so frustrated about womans and so sad that every girl that i start to like i dump her because i don't want to delay her life like KIm did to me.  I'm fucking scared of relationships, i'm fucking scared of girls , i'm fucking terrified by the idea of trust anyone else then my father and my mother. i 'm not feeling like a man anymore, i'm feeling like shit. BUT i started to train again in Muay Thai and i'm enjoying it. but i feel so fucking lone because i really do everything alone. My workout, go eat some pizza, walk in a park.. i'm so alone.   Well, i stopped to take drugs to feel better , i stopped with almost everything and started to go to gym and for now that is working, i'm just hope that someday in the future maybe.. Kim would become a nice person and will try to retake all the time that she is losting.

"Hi everyone. I am a 26 yrold mom of three, 6 and under. My depression started as a teenager, but somehow back then I was able to ""talk myself out of it"" and perhaps had enough going on to keep me distracted. I got married right after high school, and nine months later, (overnight, really) became a mom. I never intended to be a mom at nineteen. I had dreamed of going to college, enjoying years of freedom with my husband, and then, carefully ""planning"" our first child. Well, seven years later, we've planned only one (our last), and strangely enough my only planned child was the hardest to recover from emotionally. After the birth of my first child I struggled with denial over all my crushed dreams, and fought back depression and suicide on a daily basis. I saw a psychiatrist who put me on various medicines over the next few months, to no significant improvement. When my daughter was three months old I was voluntarily committed to a behavioral health facility and stayed there four days. I came out fully charged, and within a matter of days, was right back where I started. So I started seeing a therapist who did me little good, and continued on the latest medicine combination I was prescribed. Shortly after my daughter turned one I finally gave up on the medicines and the therapy and pretended to be better, even though I wasn't, because of the sheer frustration that nothing was ""helping"" so I might as well just get on with life. I continued to battle depression and suicide on a daily basis, and also struggled with behavior that was contrary to what a good mother should be. My husband was military, and it is during times in his absence that I have become ""her"", my alter ego, someone who is intolerant, impatient, selfish, and ugly towards my kids. And blah, blah, blah. Do you guys get tired of telling your life story, because I do. I've lost count of how many times I've told it to various therapists in some vain attempt to help them understand me. So let me tell you where I am now. I am a person who is deeply confused. On the one hand I dearly love my kids, my husband, and I have the desire to live life and see my children grow and strengthen my relationship with them and my husband. On the other hand, I am sapped of every last ounce of purpose, life becomes extremely monotonous, and I strain to see the point of it all. Even now, as I write this, I am wondering, ""why am I wasting my time? These people will never know one tenth of a percent of what is going on inside me."" And that is how I've left every therapy session I've ever gone to, feeling like my time was utterly wasted and like I've made a chicken scratch in an issue solid as ice and twenty feet deep. I balance on a fragile thread of life and death and I'm scared that it is only a matter of time before something tips the balance just far enough that I finally do ""it"". My biggest fear is that by the time I find a way to heal myself, if I make it that far, my kids will have paid the ultimate price and be a product of confusion and sadness too. I am sick and tired of trying to feel human. In talking with others, I feel intangible, fake, this intellect in human form but incapable of human understanding. My emotions are real; love, hate, empathy, grief, anger, happiness, but I still do not feel ""real"". I feel like I am missing some vital component that ties it all together, and without it, I am nothing more than this body walking around, emulating those around me, operating on some kind of autopilot. It goes beyond frustration and confusion, and I feel this pent up rage building inside of me, and I want to scream at the top of my lungs until I turn blue, throw a chair through a window, send dishes crashing to the floor, something through which I can channel the anger and get it as far from me as possible. And then, sorrow. Black as an abyss, tormenting hopelessness, and it is then that I contemplate suicide. Fortunately (or not) I will then remember something, some reason for why I can't do it. The other day was my sisters birthday. I didn't want her to have to remember her birthday as the day her sister killed herself. Then I bawl, because there is no way out. I can't leave, and staying means continued torment for me and the people I love, and for some reason, love me. How long must I endure this cycle? Once again I am off medication. After the birth of my third child I went on the latest wonder drug, Lexapro, and after a year with no improvement I've abandoned that as well. I also made another mental health check in when the baby (now 1 1/2) was a few months old, for six days in duration, and once again came out feeling like a hundred bucks only to crash again. I've examined the perspective that, like the books title, ""Depression is a Choice"", and have even embraced the idea. I've also embraced the idea that it is certainly not a choice, and that medication is the solution, with equally unhelpful results. I grow weary of this fruitless search to ""fix myself"". For those of you who would suggest God, yes I am a believer. I turned to him three years ago, after years of Agnosticism, in utter desperation to fill in the ""missing link"". But for whatever reason, He still isn't enough. Which is the biggest blow of all, because I truly comprehend the sacrifice that was made in my behalf with the Atonement, and yet for some reason fail to utilize it. So here I am. One big mess. And I'm joining the group, lucky you!

Not like REALLY hard, but hard enough to leave a mark. Then later he doesn't remember doing it. I'm worried about him, and myself. I don't want our relationship to end because of our problems.

"I die a little inside with every customer (TW) Let me start by saying I've been getting help for chronic depression and anxiety since January. I take sertraline (50mg) every day, and it's helped me tremendously.  I was hired as a cashier at a fast food job in November of last year, and it was a huge step forward. No education, no GED, no transportation, no job experience (except for working for a family company since I was a literal child); needless to say, I felt like I overcame a hump that had been looming in front of me for quite some time.  I've had extreme social anxiety since my early teens, so diving headfirst into a cashier job seemed a bit counter-intuitive. Now, I don't know if it was the medication or simply having no choice but to face my fears every day, but the anxiety has completely faded.  Gone. Zilch.  Good, right? Well, in its place, a little seedling sprouted, and as time goes by it swells inside my heart and head, pushes against my skull, crushes my organs, my spark, my will to move forward.  I hate people so fucking much.  I am so damn tired of hearing you complain that the price of a sandwich has increased by fifty fucking cents. I am so damn tired of cleaning up after your little brats after they throw their food on the floor.  I am so fucking fed up with you cancelling an entire fucking order, after it was already prepared, because the soda machine was out of cherry Fanta. What the fuck is wrong with you? I go home and utterly dread the next day of picking up the slack of my coworkers and dealing with a shitload of entitled, spoiled assholes.  Every now and then, there is an angel. Someone who isn't a total asshole to me...it could be something so small to you, but it can make my entire day that much easier. Perhaps you already know what you want to order, and don't hold up a line of ten people because you're picky as fuck. Perhaps you tip me 96 cents. Usually, it's treating me like I'm a feeling, thinking human instead of the shit on your heel.  I bend over backwards for these people and do my best to let them know that they're truly appreciated.  I've come so far, and yet I'm so close to giving up. It's wearisome forcing a smile every day and powering through as if I have a promising future, when I don't. I pretend that I don't slice my thighs with razors, that I'm not covered in self harm scars, that all is well. I pretend I don't fantasize every day about diving headfirst in front of a semi truck. I pretend the love of my life and best friend isn't homeless and isn't living in a tent with a heroin addict. I pretend, I pretend, I pretend. I am so tired.

"I am too much of a coward to even kill myself I am posting this here, not primarily to garner attention or sympathy, but because I have nowhere else to turn and I don't know what to do with myself. I also want to try and combat some of the embarrassment and shame that I feel in regards to being clinically address, so perhaps voicing what I am thinking here, it could potentially be therapeutic for me.  Now that is out of the way,this might get quite long, so I will put a tldr at the end of this.  Context:  I am a 20 year old girl. My whole life, my sense of worth was dictated around whether I could make the people around me happy. I had extremely strict and controlling parents and so I had no real sense of worth other than the fact that at least I didn't harbour any malicious feelings towards anyone, or try and hurt anybody deliberately. I had normal teenage 'angst' and moody, brooding periods, but absolutely not depression at all. I was completely, for want of a better word, normal.  In April 2017, I first had feelings of depression, when I realised how badly I had hurt someone who used to be very important in my life. (it is an extremely long story and I am slightly more at peace with it now so I don't feel the need to explain because it would take forever). I was incapicitated for a week, I would cry constantly, not leave my bed, and my mum would scream at me and tell me she 'didn't have time to deal with my shit'. However I had a REASON for feeling this down, so whether this was the start of a biological depression, I am not quite sure.  Fast forward to October 2017. This is where my current situation and problems begin. I am currently studying abroad in Japan- something I have been envisioning and looking forward to for 10 years. Honestly, I had been constantly dreaming about this for an extremely long time. It was what I felt my life was gearing towards, everything led to this.  However, it all went downhill. My host family is incredibly lovely, I had made a couple friends on social media before even joining the university, and there were so many intercultural exchange opportunities to join. Yet, despite this, I could feel my mood slipping gradually. I have always been a shy person and not good with strangers, but I began to feel a creeping anxiety looming up on me, that told me to not bother others, that by interacting with others I was causing them inconvenience and discomfort, and the best thing for me to do was to just be alone.  I partly attribute it to the fact I had a really awful teacher in my first semester here. Now, I think some people might think that this might be a cultural shock issue, but I am pretty sure that she was crossing ANY acceptable line, no matter what culture. Firstly she would be very rude to me in front of all my classmates. Say if I came in without makeup, in jeans (like, still showered, hair done, not sweatpants or anything, just not completely dolled up) she would say in front of everyone 'Your face isn't pretty enough to not wear any makeup. You are scaring everyone. You know girls in Japan care about their appearance. You should do too, for everyone's sake'. (Also my Japanese is perfectly adequate to understand interactions like that, so I know for a fact that this wasn't a language barrier issue. ) If I got a question wrong in class she would say 'You know, I don't know why I bother asking planyourspontaneity for answers, she is so useless'. Or if we had to make example sentences she would pick examples like 'What does planyourspontaneity need? Oh planyourspontaneity needs to learn how to make some friends'. And this became like a running joke in my class. I have never been bullied, so I never learnt to grow a thick skin, so this (what felt like) daily victimisation began to really grate and tear down my self esteem. I felt isolated so my social anxiety caused me to isolate myself, and people ignoring me, creating a vicious circle. I began to be completely mute in class, ignoring the teacher, be on my phone, having headphones in, and this obviously spurred her on as she would berate me for how I was a terrible student. Also I feel like it might be relevant to say how I told this teacher that the reason why I was so withdrawn and using my phone a lot was because my stepfather was undergoing cancer treatment and I was worried (this was true). But she still kept calling me useless and 'the worst student I have ever taught' to everyone. If I seemed withdrawn though she would stroke my thighs and lower back and neck (I think this contact thing might be a cultural difference but still) in front of everyone, which obviously made them think I was a total freak. If I made eye contact with them, they would quickly shuffle away or look disgusted.  Around November-ish time I began to suffer with very extreme bouts of depression. I felt awfully ashamed- here I was living the dream I had longed for for about a decade, and I was here for some reason feeling absolutely dreadful. Even if I had had a fun day, I still had this lingering sadness, and I would get home and cry. I started seeing a counsellor which was one of the best decisions (or rather, my long distance boyfriend decided for me) I ever made.  In December time it reached the point where I would barely go to class because the idea of seeing people, going to class, and even just getting out of my bed just seemed overwhelmingly difficult to me. I would cry all the time, tug my hair and cut my forearms, and would call the suicide hotline. My teacher emailed me numerous times, all very inappropriately about how her parents were dying to and how I should turn to God (not that I don't think that that is a viable avenue for some people, it just seemed like weird advice from my teacher) I tried going on anti depressants (Escitalopram?) but they made me vomit after just one pill so I stopped straight away. I travelled with my long distance boyfriend who came to Japan to see me, and felt nothing. Then I went to Nagano with my host family, and felt some kind of peace, and calmness. This calmness and general mellowness resided in me for some time, until now.  Current situation:  My depression came back with a vengeance yesterday during the day. At lunch time I locked myself into the bathrooms to cry and cry. I took a tranquilliser that had been prescribed for me during bouts of extreme depression to curb the urge to self harm and it did nothing. I hate myself so much. This exchange, this is what I wanted my life to lead up to, and my fucking brain is ruining it all for me. Aside from this, I had nothing to look forward to in my life. I just want to be happy, I want for people to not hate me. I know most people hate me because of the way they act around me, they won't invite me to any class activities even if I am right there, and I will be the only one not in the class group chat, class karaoke nights, etc etc. Literally the only one. I am scared of going to intercultural lounges to interact with people because they all know each other from last semester, and I can't even talk to people in real life in the first place. I just feel like an alien. I don't feel like I was meant to be born in this world at all. All I want is to be suddenly transported into a different world. I don't want to be here anymore. I just want to be asleep forever. I want to be dead.  But I am scared of death. I wish I was religious so I had some motivation for either killing myself and going to heaven, or for fear of hell having motivation and stay alive. What if it hurts? What if the nothingness is unbearable?  But I want to be dead. Every time I see a train go by I want to jump so badly. I know my boyfriend and family would be sad but they would get over it. He would get a better, non depressed girlfriend so he doesn’t have to deal with my shit anymore. My dad has a new daughter he treats better than he ever did me. My mum would be devastated but I don’t know if I can hold on just for her sake.  Anyway, I know I am not such a loss to the world.

"I finally came out to my close friends that I have depression, and now I'm being alienated because I'm ""not mentally stable"" Probably a rant, but what the fuck.  This last college semester was horrible on me, and I came out of it with depression and depression meds. I'm 19M in college right now. I thought it was pretty obvious, but I wanted to tell my friends about why I've been talking less and have been hermitting myself out a little. So the next time we're all together, I tell them that I have depression and that's why I'm taking meds and that's why I've gotten so quiet, ect. And... Barely any response. Basically just some ""oh, ok..."" Like really? But it get's better.   So the night after I tell them, I get a message from one of my ""friends"", whom I was going to room with next year. The message said, and I can quote, that they ""don't feel safe around a mentally dark person"" in their house. Ok, what? Even better, the convo goes on and says that my group of friends were talking... And they don't want to, in quotes again, ""Associate with a mentally dark person"" as a friend. Like what the fuck? It's been a week and they've lived up to it. Suddenly I'm not getting invited anywhere or anything. If I'm with my friends (I still try to hang out), I'll get heavily ignored. Like what the fuck, my depression has now gotten so much worse.   I want to ditch every single one of them, but I honestly don't have any other close friends outside of this group. I'm trying my best to find new friends, and if that happens, I 'll happily leave these people who consider depression sufferers ""dark and unstable and unsafe"".

"I've never talked about this to anyone I've struggled with depression since I was in 2nd grade. For the last 7 years it's gotten worst, I'm 20 at the moment. When I was 13 I was raped occasionally. Being raped when it first happen didn't bother me as much because I didnt understand what was happening until years later. What did bother me at the time was that I felt alone. I've always felt alone, never felt like anyone cared for me or about me. I fought with my mom and step dad a lot which made me feel even more lonely. I never talked about feeling lonely to anyone because I was always embarrassed about it and still do. Because me and my parents had a rocky relationship I would be abused by both at times. One time I was arguing with my mom and she ended up getting a 2 by 4 and started hitting me with it. I never rasied my hands at my parents, just talked a lot of shit and was an asshole to them. My parents kicked me out of their house when I was 14. I ended up living with my grandpa. This made me feel unwanted and even more lonely now that my parents gave up on me. I lived with my grandpa for about 9 months before he sent me back to my parents because he couldn't ""afford"" to keep me. I wasn't an asshole to my grandpa nor was I mean to him, I just was a teen who stayed up late and took long showers. My grandpa giving up on me was heartbreaking for me. I felt like no one wanted me and if I ended everything then everything would be better. I didn't even last a week at my parents house, they shipped me off to live with some family who lived in the rural country area instead of the city. I lived there for maybe 4 months and finished my freshmen year of high school there. I didn't feel welcomed anywhere I went and for the most part I felt more beyond alone. Majority of the time at my uncle's I was in my room, alone and desperate for a friend. After 4 lonely months of really being alone I was given back to my parents again. After coming home broken I learned to keep to myself. No one wanted me and no one cared.   When I got back home I was sent to an all boy high school. Once again I had to go to a new school and try to fit in somehow. I was lonely for a while until I met this girl. I'm afraid to write her name incase she ever reads this and it hurts reading/writing it but I need to get this off my chest. I met this beautiful girl named Cindy at a school function. She went to the all girl school down a couple streets. Both all gender schools would make events for each other to get students that social interaction. Anyways I meet this beautiful girl named Cindy, she was nice to me and I was nice to her. We dated for over a year and while it lasted it was nice. The way she broke up with me literally broke me. I was having a really sad day and told her about how I struggle with really bad depression and that I have suicidal thoughts. Her response was ""oh"" and she slowly stopped talking to me. Eventually she stopped talking to me and when she did talk to me she made excuses about not having time to talk to me. She was my only friend, the only person I was close to. She couldn't be there for me when I needed her most, when I needed a friend most. So I stayed alone thinking maybe school was too much for her at the moment. Then one day I get on Facebook only to see her on it, I clicked on her page and saw that she had been on hanging out with friends and having the time of her life. She slowly broke me, I couldn't handle it and called her to confront her about it. She made excuses and talked about how she didnt have time for me at the moment, so she hung up and left it alone. I was reaching my breaking point, I was going to commit suicide. I sent her a text message talking about how I needed her to talk to me and be a friend because I was getting worst. She never responded to me however she did get in contact with my school to let them know what I was dealing with.   I was so embarrassed that she did this to me, I felt betrayed and hurt that she made me the schools problem instead of hers. It hurt ne so bad. I was embarrassed that the school knew, I was embarrassed that my parents knew now. I wanted to kill myself more than ever now. I was so hurt by this and was angry at Cindy. I went home and tried stabbing myself. My mom went in my room to talk to me, just so happened at that moment I had a kitchen knife in my hand to stab myself. My mon fought me over it and sent me to a psychiatric hospital. I stayed there until December 23rd. At the hospital I tried killing myself twice. First time was when the guards/residents give you cracks, I ate the crackers but stuffed the wrapper down my throat. One if the residents heard me making choking nosies and came in to save me. Second time was when I started swallowing my food instead of chewing on it to choke me out again. They put me on these medications that didn't help but I acted like they did so I can go home. I was alone again, Cindy stopped talking to me. It broke my heart and broke me.   It's been 4 years since Cindy and I'm not over it. It still kills me about what happened. I'm still depressed and suicidal. I honestly wish I did kill myself when I had the courage to do so. There hasn't been much for me other than pain. I haven't moved on and I haven't gotten over everything. This was my deepest darkest moment in my life so far. I wish I could say things got better for me since all of that but true is they haven't. I'm still the same lonely person I've always felt I've been for the longest time. I've tried dating in college and I've never had feelings for anyone. Don't have many friends and don't have any real reasons to be here still. I'm just waiting on that one thing to break me down to give me courage.   If you read this thank you. Im sorry I made you read a lot and I'm sorry that I'm this way. I'll get better one day but not soon.

"I'm not worth it I just don't feel like I'm worth anyone's time or effort, and I just feel like a burden to everyone.  I have a part time job (anywhere between 20-39 hours a week) and I'm at college (in the UK &amp; I'm 18)and I'm constantly tired.  My mum is such a lovely person, but I really do feel like she'd be better off without me, she's always complaining how she never has time to do anything (she works 30 hours a week + she always cooks + cleans up after my stepdad and brother but complains about any mess I've made)  and I'm lazy, messy and I quite often ruin her day. But I'm sure I've ruined her whole life.  She had me when she was 19, which meant she had to quit her job because she couldn't afford childcare and she had an abusive step-dad, who would refuse to let her mum look after me, and she also fell out with her very religious grandparents as she wasn't married (they have since made up). She then couldn't get a job until I started school (which is actually a decent job). At this new job, she met my step-dad (after a few years) and they've since had a child together (who also doesn't seem to like me one bit). My step dad seems to hate me more than my mum does, but I can't complain because neither of them are abusive, and this is one of my problems; I feel like I shouldn't moan about anything in my life; I live in a decent sized 3 bedroom house, I have an education and I also have a job. Whilst my mum lived with her abusive step-dad, was forced to quit college (so she could get a job to start paying rent) and was also forced to baby sit whilst her parents went out drinking every other night. Yet here I am, never feeling happy, without many friends (I talk to the people at work when I'm there and I have 2 other friends that I speak to around twice a month, normally because there other friends are busy and they want to complain about their boyfriends, or because the other friend doesn't want to go  shopping on her own ( another reason why I don't have a reason to be negative; she was in care and now classified as homeless as she's now 18 and not catered for in the care system, so now she has to live in temporary accommodation with lots of drug users in the same building.)  I feel like I just ruin everything, if I'm downstairs with my family, there always seems to be an argument, even if I'm not involved in the argument. But if everyone else is in the living room, whilst I'm upstairs in my own, I can only ever here them laughing and enjoying themselves. It's like, even when I haven't done anything, I seem to just produce a negative atmosphere.  I really don't want to be here anymore, if I disappeared, it wouldn't really effect any one, my mum might be upset at first but she'd quickly realise how much better her life is without me. The problem is that I'm even too lazy and stupid to kill myself, so I'm just secretly hoping that a medical issue that has been ongoing for a while (and I haven't been to the doctor's in years because I would just be wasting their time, when they could be helping someone better than me) is serious, and nature will take its cause...",not worth just not feel like worth time effort just feel like burden everyone time job anywhere hour week college in uk amp and constantly tired mum lovely person really feel like better me complaining time she work hour week cook clean stepdad brother complains mess made lazy messy quite ruin day sure ruined life meant quit job not afford childcare abusive stepdad refuse let mum look me fell religious grandparent not married they up not job started school which actually decent job new job met stepdad after year child who doe not like bit step dad hate mum doe complain abusive problem feel like not moan life live decent sized bedroom house education job whilst mum lived abusive stepdad forced quit college so job start paying rent forced baby sit whilst parent went drinking night am feeling happy friend i talk people work friend speak twice month normally friend busy want complain boyfriend friend doe not want shopping reason not reason negative care classified homeless not catered care system live temporary accommodation lot drug user building feel like just ruin everything downstairs family argument not involved argument living room whilst upstairs own laughing enjoying themselves like not anything just produce negative atmosphere really not want anymore disappeared not really effect one mum upset quickly realise better life me problem lazy stupid kill myself just secretly hoping medical issue ongoing and not doctor year just wasting time helping better me serious nature cause,0.4351983666419983,0.5000808238983154,0.4234082102775574

"Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad? Well I often do, quite sometimes frankly. I just miss those good old days, when life was just so beautiful and easy. Nothing to worry about, nothing to cry for other than silly childish little things.  My childhood was so beautiful. It was in France. It's been now a whole decade since I left France - the country I've always admired and will always do. I remember going to school, having so many friends, I felt like I'm the happiest child on Earth.  Then suddenly one day, everything changed. The passing of time took away from me my childhood, my friends, my beloved France. Life suddenly just changed like that. No more joy, no more innocence, no more real friends, no more homeland. No more beautiful sunny days, only darkness, depression, nostalgia and tears.  I'm trying to survive day by day through this hell on Earth. Each time those memories of my childhood flashbacks, I can't help stopping the tears that drop from my eyes. Whenever someone mentions France, I get overwhelmed.   I'm living the hardest time of my life. A 10-year ""war in lifetime"", as I call it, still going on, and doesn't seem to have an end soon. I know those good old times are just memories, obviously. Tomorrow when I wake up, things will be just the same. But my hope will never die. My redemption will come, soon or late. This moment of my life will also be just memories, just like those good old days of my childhood in France.  I didn't go in detail 'cause I don't think many people will be interested in my story.

"I want to share a personal project I'm proud of A month ago I was feeling completely unmotivated to do anything. I was feeling that none of my connections with friends are as deep as they used to be, that I'm not as close to my family as I used to be, that nothing I do at work really matters, and that my health is slowly deteriorating. I just wanted to quit at everything.  Then I was hanging out with a friend I hadn't seen in a while, and he admitted to me that he had been struggling with depression, so we both opened up about it. He ended up recommending the book ""Feeling Good"" to me, since it had helped him improve a lot. I read it and was initially a bit disappointed... some parts were underwhelming, some felt annoying/condescending, and the solution to every problem seemed to be the ""three-column technique."" But after trying a few of the exercises in the book, I admit it turned out to be somewhat helpful.  One of the exercises/quizzes in the book is the ""Depression Checklist,"" which (as I'm sure many of you are aware of) assesses your level of depression on a scale from 1 to 100. At the time, I was scoring in the ""Moderate"" range. After a couple weeks of applying some of the exercises, I was down to the ""Mild"" range. So I decided to create a project that might help me learn a bit more about myself, with regard to the effect of my daily habits on my level of depression.  What I wanted to build was a simple web app that would let me score my productivity on a daily basis (based on exercising, reading, socializing, meditating, etc) and then plot that against my daily depression score. I wanted to see if there was a correlation between higher productivity and lower depression, or if certain activities had a greater impact on my mood.  Ironically what I discovered was that working on the project itself was a huge mood-booster for me, since it gave me a sense of purpose and was a great outlet for creativity. As I've gotten further along in the work, I've noticed my depression level has slowly started rising again. But for a while, I was actually in the ""Normal"" range of depressive emotions! I couldn't believe it.  Regardless, the project has also given me more insight into a few things that drastically help my mood. Even though my mood isn't at the level it was a couple weeks ago, it's nice to know that investing in personal projects gives me a lot of satisfaction :)  (Also if anyone is interested in trying out the app, feel free to check it out [here](https://beok.herokuapp.com/). It's stupid simple and still a work in progress, but I'm still kinda proud of it... and if it were able to help even just one other person, that would make me pretty happy &lt;3)",want share personal project proud month ago feeling completely unmotivated anything feeling connection friend deep used be not close family used be work really matter health slowly deteriorating just wanted quit everything hanging friend not seen while admitted struggling depression opened it ended recommending book feeling good me helped improve lot read initially bit disappointed part underwhelming felt annoyingcondescending solution problem threecolumn technique trying exercise book admit turned somewhat helpful exercisesquizzes book depression checklist a sure aware of ass level depression scale time scoring moderate range couple week applying exercise mild range decided create project help learn bit myself regard effect daily habit level depression wanted build simple web app let score productivity daily basis based exercising reading socializing meditating etc plot daily depression score wanted correlation higher productivity lower depression certain activity greater impact mood ironically discovered working project huge moodbooster me gave sense purpose great outlet creativity gotten work noticed depression level slowly started rising again while actually normal range depressive emotion not believe it regardless project given insight thing drastically help mood mood not level couple week ago nice know investing personal project give lot satisfaction also interested trying app feel free check here stupid simple work progress kinda proud it able help just person make pretty happy lt,0.36801430583000183,0.42460787296295166,0.36425650119781494

"Dropping by to mention you should take some Vitamin D supplements. Of course, check with your doctor. Etc. etc.   Vitamin D is the sunshine pill that most people are deficient in. This is also much more of an issue in colder areas or for those who cover up from the sun often. The best way to get vitamin D is through certain food combinations and routines in sitting in delicate morning sunlight and in most cases, taking a supplement is necessary to keep this vitamin flowing in your body.   Vitamin D is best absorbed with calcium, so if you’re taking a supplement, finding foods, or sitting in the sun consider to add the calcium as well.   You will find that your mood will be better or more stable with vitamin D consumption.  Make sure to strive for a more regulated sleeping schedule as well and something to keep your mind stimulated without an electronic screen.

"Why my relationship is killing me Okay, disclaimer, former relationship... but it still has a huge effect on my life.  This girl was my best friend and my first serious relationship. I met her when I first got depressed, and we went to the same church together.  I told her then that I didn't feel ready for a relationship, but she essentially stalked me all those (5) years ago.  Christmas 2016, after dealing with a crap load more grief and depression, I was essentially forced into a relationship with her.  I had just got over my main stint of depression the previous September, and my life was getting better.  We still hung out as friends, but she kept pushing for more.  However, she is so messed up.  I have to say that now. I do still love her, and that will probably never change, but she needs professional help, and my mistake was thinking I could help her.  She was my best friend after all.  So, after a string of breakups, moving too slow and moving too fast, as well as her cheating on my several times, she finally called it quits one week after my birthday (November just gone). I had no say, because she'd throw a tantrum, but I had to take the initiative.  Why?  Because she no longer wanted to have my baby.  In August, she fell pregnant.  This could have been the week prior the Anniversary of our first kiss, but the nurse dated it on that specific date.  That was one of the nights she cheated on me, with her friend's boyfriend, but it was ""just a kiss"".  She tried to miscarry by drinking heavily for the next few weeks before coming to me about it; she had broken up with me the day after she cheated.  I asked her there and then if she wanted to keep it.  She said yes. We went to speak to my mum.  My mum asked her.  She said yes. She wanted to announce the pregnancy, to start all the planning, and looking forward to the future.  I got a well paying job to provide for our future, a job I travelled hundreds of miles for each week, and it was only for a few months.  But whilst I was away, she decided she missed all the drinking, drugs, and sex she was missing out on.  She wanted to live with her friends (who she actually hates living with at times), and countless other reasons.  However, she kept stringing me along until the scan, where she sent me a photo of our child before telling me she wanted to abort it.  Oh, and I had planned a weekend away for us to relax and see some friends.  She had me believe this was the start of my happy ever after, before ripping it away from me.  She didn't speak to me for two weeks.  When I finally did manage to get in touch, it was to collect my stuff.  I took a mutual friend with me, the act as a buffer, and they couldn't believe the stuff that she said to me.  Then I get a load of hate off her because people are contacting her about her choices. Remember, she has been posting on FB all about the baby, making sure everyone knows.  She hasn't spoken to me since.  She has blocked me anyway she can, even on WhatsApp only recently... not that it matters, because she wants nothing to do with me.  This was my best friend, and my stalker, who for years wanted to be with me, have a family with me, worried I wouldn't want her because of PCOS, and got jealous over people talking to me on Twitter, and kittens!  She couldn't even handle me showing up with chocolates and flowers! All that I've done for her, supported her, sacrificed for her... and this is how she treats me.  Now, I am pro-life, and pro-choice.  I gave her that choice, and she wanted to go ahead.  I didn't force her or convince her.  She led me. She set me up, just to rip out my heart.  Seriously, if you only knew the half of it.  The card she wrote for me for my birthday alone would have anyone convinced.  But now, she is living her life.  She is out drinking, smoking, doing drugs and sleeping with anything she can get her claws into. She has restarted her YouTube ""career"", and quite frankly, they're boring videos.  Maybe she'll do better.  I hope not.  But I think that's normal.  So why this post? Because it is killing me.  I don't know how, but I'm still kicking.  Depression is creeping at my door, and I do have horrible days, bad days where I am so demotivated.  Yet, I cannot stop thinking about her.  She has me broken, in ruins... even my faith has been hit hard. I don't understand what changed.  I don't understand she did what she did.  Why did she play me for so long just to hurt me?  Everyone tells me to forget about her, and no one would allow me to go back to her (even if it was a possibility).  All I want to do is to forget about her, because as the title says... this relationship is killing me.",relationship killing okay disclaimer relationship huge effect life girl best friend relationship met got depressed went church together told did not feel ready relationship essentially stalked year ago christmas dealing crap load grief depression essentially forced relationship her just got main stint depression previous september life getting better hung friend kept pushing more however messed up say now love her probably change need professional help mistake thinking help her best friend all so string breakup moving slow moving fast cheating time finally called quits week birthday november just gone say throw tantrum initiative why longer wanted baby august fell pregnant week prior anniversary kiss nurse dated specific date night cheated me friend boyfriend just kiss tried miscarry drinking heavily week coming it broken day cheated asked wanted it said yes went speak mum mum asked her said yes wanted announce pregnancy start planning looking forward future got paying job provide future job travelled hundred mile week month whilst away decided missed drinking drug sex missing on wanted live friend who actually hate living time countless reason however kept stringing scan sent photo child telling wanted abort it oh planned weekend away relax friend believe start happy after ripping away me did not speak week finally did manage touch collect stuff took mutual friend me act buffer not believe stuff said me load hate people contacting choice remember posting fb baby making sure know not spoken since blocked can whatsapp recently not matter want me best friend stalker year wanted me family me worried not want pcos got jealous people talking twitter kitten not handle showing chocolate flower her supported her sacrificed her treat me now prolife prochoice gave choice wanted ahead did not force convince her led me set up just rip heart seriously knew half it card wrote birthday convinced now living life drinking smoking doing drug sleeping claw into restarted youtube career quite frankly boring video maybe better hope not think normal post killing me not know how kicking depression creeping door horrible day bad day demotivated yet stop thinking her broken ruin faith hit hard not understand changed not understand did did did play long just hurt me tell forget her allow even possibility want forget her title say relationship killing me,0.5077294111251831,0.41513463854789734,0.5892360210418701
"Had one of those days where I really wanted to just get out of bed and be with people: hit up my friends and no one could hang out or seemed into it. Really brought me down, man. I feel like I give a lot and don't get a whole lot in return sometimes. And part of this is probably just egocentrism. I shouldn't expect my friends to plan their day around me last minute, even though I told them I was feeling lonely. It just sucks because I feel like I would do anything for the people I care about, like I would drop anything to be there. I put those standards on other people and maybe that's wrong of me.  Anyway, I just sat around with my pup and ate too much and watched tv so it is what it is.",day really wanted just bed people hit friend hang it really brought down man feel like lot not lot return sometimes probably just egocentrism not expect friend plan day minute told feeling lonely just suck feel like people care about like drop there standard people maybe wrong me anyway just sat pup ate watched tv is,0.4002147614955902,0.3727365732192993,0.45061126351356506

"Well I'm getting ready to go back to school so I'm trying to get sober for a while and see i can clear my head. So far I've been sober for about days and i must say I'm not feeling any better. Some of the problem is probably zyrtec which I'm taking for my allergies but really i just feel really irritable and confused. i can't really think too well and it's making me want to drink. Drinking slows down my mind somewhat so i can focus on things in my head. Normally its not till the next day after a good night of drinking that i feel good for most of the next day. i am more talkative and can come up with things much easier. There are people who use Prozac and other anti-depressant drugs not because they want it but because it makes them feel even better than they normally do. This is somewhat my issue with alcohol however i don't fell good normally i feel like s**t normally. i guess i should let u in on what is really bothering me. First ill just list the problems i have i find most worrying. Night blindness ""fuzzy vision"" bad sinus pressure moderate fatigue all the time short term memory problems random aches and pains major depression, anxiety, and ocd bad allergies acid reflux. To be honest most scary one is night blindness. Trying to explain is pretty difficult but ill try. It's like being able to see all the cons and rods and your eye flash on and off constantly kind of like a bad channel on a TV screen. I've had it for years now with no one who can really give me straight answer about it. i went to my doctor recently and got up the nerve to tell him but thought he gave me some good info he probably thought i was mad. Anyway one of the first things your body will do when it's over exerted is give u fuzzy vision. Now normally night blindness is caused be a vitamin A deficiency. Maybe there is something wrong with my stomach that is making me feel the way i am and i did have kidney stone when i was 2 which is very rare. i know this is a lot of information but this is what i deal with on a ""daily"" basis. My daily routine is almost exactly the same except on weekends when i do go out and drink with my friends. my will is low and energy just as low so i find myself kind of in and out of this trance that is supposed to be life. Each day i go to work, come home, eat, and up to my room for pretty much the rest of the night. don't get me wrong i do other things during the week sometimes but i feel most comfortable by myself in my room as opposed to human contact which sucks. So if i have to drink to keep from going over the deep end then i will do so until i get some real answers. If anyone has any answers I'm all ears.",getting ready school trying sober clear head far sober day say not feeling better problem probably zyrtec taking allergy really just feel really irritable confused really think making want drink drinking slows mind somewhat focus thing head normally not till day good night drinking feel good day talkative come thing easier people use prozac antidepressant drug not want make feel better normally do somewhat issue alcohol not fell good normally feel like st normally guess let u really bothering me ill just list problem worrying night blindness fuzzy vision bad sinus pressure moderate fatigue time short term memory problem random ache pain major depression anxiety ocd bad allergy acid reflux honest scary night blindness trying explain pretty difficult ill try like able con rod eye flash constantly kind like bad channel tv screen year really straight answer it went doctor recently got nerve tell thought gave good info probably thought mad thing body exerted u fuzzy vision normally night blindness caused vitamin deficiency maybe wrong stomach making feel way did kidney stone rare know lot information deal daily basis daily routine exactly weekend drink friend low energy just low kind trance supposed life day work come home eat room pretty rest night not wrong thing week feel comfortable room opposed human contact suck drink going deep end real answer answer ear,0.42735591530799866,0.4649932384490967,0.41669589281082153
"I'm just so fucking lonely and I'm tired of pretending I'm fine Fair warning I'm about to just spill out everything I have bottled up into this post  I'm so tired of being alone I can't bare it anymore. My depression and anxiety is slowly killing me. I'm a 23 year old male, trying to restart my adult life in college after many failed attempts at succeeding anywhere else. I work and I go to school, I see hundreds of smiling and happy faces, and I feel like I'm not even really there with them. Like a one way mirror where I see them but I'm never seen.  I have no friends. I used to be a part of rather large group of friends, but as of now I couldn't tell you the last time I talked to any of those people. They've either moved on and some of them are no longer on this earth. I have acquaintances with people at work, but they have their own life to live and when it's time to clock out, again I am left to go home alone and broken. The only person I ""have"" is my mother, and she tends to make matters worse when I try to open.  I'm also desperately single. I haven't been in a relationship, let alone just dated someone, in years. And it's soul crushing. I see all these happy couples around campus, beautiful men and women, having the time of their lives with each other. And I'm so fucking jealous man. I want that happiness so desperately bad. I want to love someone, I want to FEEL loved! I want someone to help me through days like today, and to be there for them when they have those days. I want the cheesy shit like cuddling and laughing over stupid stuff. I want the inevitable times where we're pissed at each other about something, but we work through it and end up going crawling up next to each other in bed at the end of the night, and wake up to see each other to start the day. I'm tired of waking up to this massive empty bed, cold and alone.  But most of all, I'm tired of pretending. Of having to pretend. To wear this mask every single fucking day of my life just to pretend to be normal. Just so my coworkers won't think I'm weird. Just so my mom won't go off about how I just need to get my shit together. Just so I can hold up the chance that one day I'll be able to overcome my massive wall of social anxiety and try to talk to someone, make a friend, maybe meet a girl.   All in all I'm tired of pretending I'm happy, that I'm fine. BECAUSE IM NOT FUCKING FINE! I'm not happy, I'm slowly dying over here and I can't take this shit anymore. I desperately want to change. I desperately want to live a ""normal"" life, and I just keep sinking further and further down while everyone else passes me by.  I guess my rant is over.

"Long Winded Post From a Failed 30 Year Old I don't even necessarily want to write this but I need to clear my head. I've been a depressed pissant for as long as I could remember. Some of my youngest memories are melancholic and sickly devoid of confidence or even reason.  I grew up dirt poor. I remember spending a night pushing a needle through the rubber of my shoes to get the sole back on. My mom had a stroke and an aneurysm but survived. Sort of. She became a wicked, wicked creature who loved pitting me against my sibling and I never came out on top. My entire life has been from the cowering creature perspective. Life isn't experienced but something that happens to me.  I joined the Army at 18. I had gotten recklessly married a month prior to shipping to basic. I ended up fucking up and missing a bus which led to a Lemony Snicket series of Unfortunate Events type shit. I went through partial infantry brainwashing but never made it past the build-up.  So I ended my career, the only thing I've wanted to do, before it even took off. Luckily, it was more of a ""this isn't working so we'll forget it happened"" type deal and my enlistment ended without anything terrible. But I never recovered. At least back then I had some sort of tenacity. Now? I'm a fucking shell, mate, of what I was. A completely hollow individual.  I'm 30 years old. I've no education. I have no passions. I used to enjoy writing but I can't bring myself to write anymore. The moment I try I go back into wounded animal mode. No, this isn't good enough. Nope, neither is this. Why bother? Why try? I can't help but think these things.  I'm still married and that is the only reason I haven't killed myself. I did try early on because of relentless hounding from my father in law. It is obvious I'm not what he wanted for his daughter. I can't figure out why I'm alive at all. I can barely live my life.  I'm depressed constantly. No matter how happy I know I should be or how wide I smile I'm in the grey of storm clouds that seemed, at least until this subreddit, to be only over my head. I've had so many jobs that I just explosively quit. I've got Intermittent Explosive Disorder as well as depression and anxiety. So I coil up and wind tightly before my brain dumps chemicals that make me explode with no regard for the damage done. I'm currently unemployed. I left my last job like that. I loved my job. I loved the guy I worked for. I earned several raises within a few months and was promoted quickly because I threw my back into that work.  It has been too long though. I can't seem to find another job. I can't even bring myself to apply anymore. I don't have a car. I ""rent"" a couple rooms off the main house of my inlaws. I failed so hard in giving my wife a life worth living. She spends her time working and though understands and doesn't mind my unemployment it is killing me.  On Dec.12th I lost all interest in anything. I used to escape in video games but now I can't. I load up Ark and just stare. I've anxiety about everything. Recently installed Heroes of the Storm and I played a mean Lili and Abathaur but now I've got butterflies even playing against bots. The smallest, most simple of tasks seems beyond me.  I'm stupider than I used to be. How I interpret the simplest of sentences or instruction is out of whack. I have trouble reading though I've got tons of read Omnibuses from Warhammer 40k on my bookshelf. I have trouble speaking. I talk slowly and can barely push out the words off my tongue. I'm only recently able to make phonecalls without losing my mind anxiety wise.  I'm so full of regret. I hate what I became. I hate that I married someone and am dragging them through the mud. To never have a real apartment or car. I can't hold a job. I barely take care of the house. I do dishes now but it is a real struggle.  I've been thinking a lot more about suicide and I'm already sure I am too cowardly to really do it but I think about it a lot. How it'd hurt my wife but I think it'd be good for her to find someone else. I just don't see the point in continuing. I'm an adult now but I never learned how to properly be an adult.  I don't know what to do. There is a burning hole in my chest and I feel guilty that I'm the way that I am. Even on the subreddit. I know people feel that people who've a significant other can't be as depressed but I'm swimming at the bottom of the barrel.  I want this all to end. I don't know how to survive. I don't know how people manage it. I don't have that self-preservation sense that keeps people going despite it all. I'm weak. I am weak in ways that I can barely accept.  I struggle a lot with the fact 22 veterans a day kill themselves but I'm still around. I carry endless guilt that better people die and I'm still alive. Goddamn it. People are dying from diseases and cancers while I exist. While I can't so much as go outside without feeling like all eyes are boring holes into my psyche. I hate that all I do is sit here and lay in bed. I hate myself.  I feel if I don't get this out, even if it is never seen by anyone, I will implode. I'm on medication and it helped my depression but then the reality of my life struck me and I think I'm worse off than I was. At least then I was able to lose myself in video games. Now I'm here with the stark reality. I am not meant for this world. I am too sensitive, too weak, too weak-willed, and too much of a bitch to handle life. I'll go back to lurking now.

"I need to get my life on track Im 23 year old black man who just graduated from one of the best universities in the US. I've been depressed as fuck for a large portion of the last 4-6 years. I have no money, no girlfriend(or prospects), and no social life to speak of. I had a solid social life in college but had no luck with girls. Made a lot of friends but none that I'd consider great ones. I'm  afraid of public expression, if I come out of this shell I'll just be that little underdeveloped, short loser who thinks he's the shit when he's accomplished nothing in life. I'm afraid of what other people think of me, do they think I'm smart? Do they think I'm nerdy? Do they think I can't dance? Do they think I'm too short? Do they think I'm attractive? Do they think I'm gay? Do they think my voice is deep enough? Do they think I'm laid back? Do they think I'm fake? Do they think I'm a pussy? Do they think I get girls? Do they think my dick is small? Do they think I'm dressed well? Do they think I'm shy? Do they think I'm lame for a black guy? Do they think I act too white? Do they notice the awkwardness when I talk? Do they think I speak well? Do they think I ask too many questions? This causes me to lie to the people around me, including my family about little things that it's unnecessary to lie about. To put on this front of fake confidence when inside I feel like I'm not worth shit. I blow off my friends and then justify it to myself that I'm somehow too good for them. I don't pick up phone calls from family members and try to keep to myself. I just do nothing all day and wait for shit to come to me. I'm not the guy that gets girls, when it comes to trying to actually start a relationship with a girl my awkwardness and lameness just begins to show itself and she immediately senses it and can tell I'm not shit. I've had sex with 2 girls in my life and couldn't actually bust a nut for whatever reason. I'm an asshole to the people around me that do really nice things for me but somehow my brain keeps justifying my behavior and I keep doing it. I can't bring myself to do anything that is remotely productive or will help me better my life. I'm self aware to the point where I know I'm being a complete piece of shit but I can't find the motivation to turn it around. It's like my brain telling me I'll be content just living in my parents house until I'm fucking 60 years old. Somehow when I look in the mirror I see myself as an attractive man, I just look super young for 23, people say I look as young as 16 so I'm also self conscious about that which also makes me put on this facade when I'm around people. Recently for long stretches of months I just go completely ghost and don't leave the house or do anything of use. On the bright side I've had many positive experiences in life where I've felt my potential as a person start to become realized. I have a degree in communication studies from a top 15 university in the US. I have a family that loves and supports me (but probably wants me to move out just as much as I want to move out). This is all pretty incoherent and stream of consciousness but my brain is just really jumbled right now and I had to vent.

"Hi everyone. I am here because I am very depressed due to uncontrollable situations of extreme stress this year and a lifetime of stupid choices that have led me to where I am today: lonely and sad. I talked to my primary dr. and now have been taking Zoloft for almost 2 months. It seems to help some, I don't feel like I will panic to the point of losing control completely. And I am seeking help, I don't have a therapist yet, but I checked with my insurance and wrote some names down, now I have to pick up the phone and speak into the receiver and set an appointment. My plan is to do this on Monday. I like to be supportive of others, so although I do sound gloomy, I hope to meet others who are making progress and maybe be of help to you, too. I will post more later I feel the need to sleep. I have trouble with sleep and nightmares and eating, lately I have to force myself to eat, I have a weird aversion to food, I start to feel sick & queasy when I try to eat. But life in general makes me sick and queasy. I am alone for the Holidays which suits me just fine. I wish I could go to the ""Island of misfit people"" and stay there and never leave. For now that is the comfort and safety of my home, unless I go to work or need groceries.

"Long text, I just want an audience. Why haven’t I killed myself yet?  It’s not the title, but a question that lingers on the back of my head every second. It’s a common trend that people live for other people but what do you do when you have no one to live for? I never had anyone to live for. It’s not a huge problem really, its another lingering question or jealousy I have whenever I meet a person. Every single one of them have someone who cares for them, even a stranger would care for them. It makes me feel jealous that no one would care for me or even bother to be nice to me unless I open my mouth and say I have cancer or they knew about any of my situation. People don’t care, they pity me. They realize, then, that I’m a hopeless situation and they can’t help me at all because they really can’t. No one can. Therapies don’t help. My therapist knows all of my situations are out of my control and he wants me to move forward with my life. It’s not really a bad idea, it’s the smart thing to do especially being someone in my situation. I just don’t know why I can’t. Every single being on the planet wants me to graduate already but my body doesn’t agree with me. It’s always either I’m too sad/ stressed/ depressed/ ashamed/ anxious/ lazy to go to school. Nothing helps. Not even the 30mg of Lexapro helps. My school counsellor is doing the nice “I get it, I understand” approach with me and it makes me feel better but it really does make me feel guilty.  I just don’t understand why are people act so shitty with me? Is it my face? Is it because no one cares and all I have is literally myself? Is it because I’m dying soon? What is it really? I just want to fucking die but I cant just let myself slash my throat or swallow a lot of pills because I’m a coward. I want the easy way out. Why isn’t cancer an instant death? Why aren’t suicide booths similar to futurama a thing?   I give up. I just want to die.   P.S. Fuck people who say they’re afraid of rejection because hunty what world do u fucking live in that not one single person has said no to you?    P.P.S. Fuck you E, I’m sorry I disappointed you that I didn’t die yet even my diagnosis’ average life span is 6 months. Don’t worry, it’s coming. And I surely fucking hope karma is real. It’s fucking people like you who deserve such things and what do you fucking get? A nice family, a handsome face, people who likes to be around you. You’re one of the people who deserve my revenge and yet I’m being like a pussy who is letting a fake thing called “karma” take care of everything. In this fucking lifetime, not a single one got any karma.

"Hello everyone. My name is Amy. I discovered this page just by searching on the internet for depression forums. One good thing about me, I believe, is that I'm very mature for my age. I am seventeen, and really hope everyone here is open-minded to age being just a number. So please, do not reply telling me I will have it better later on, or my problems are because of my age. I know there is a possibility that things will get better, and believe me, I really do not think this has to do with teenage hormones. I have read about many middle aged women and men with the same problems. I understand that I am a very negative person, most likely due to depression. I am very irritable, only maybe once a week I am happy for most of the day. I also know that I have never really been happy. I have never been optimistic, and have always been sensitive, emotional, and not very confident. At the moment I do not have any friends. I haven't really had any friends for a few years now. Once every few months or so I'll go out, and then just want to leave within a couple of hours. It's very stressful to me. And when I do want to leave, I just tell myself I have a problem, because everyone else I know seems to get along with people just fine. I am also like this with jobs. I go in and out of jobs. One time I even faked a family emergency just to leave work...and I was crying about it. If one thing goes wrong for me, if I smile at someone and they don't smile back, if I feel insecure in any way, my first reaction is to flee. I also, for the most part of my life have always been in a relationship. My boyfriend as of right now and I have been together for over a year. Both of us cheated on each other in the beginning of our relationship, which might be the cause of our jealousy problems now(mostly mine). But, before this relationship, I also had the same problem. I never felt good enough, I believe I will never feel pretty enough. I have big issues with porn, and basically every little thing you can think of. Recently I've been reading about depression and anxiety. I feel the more I understand how and that it is a part of me, the worse I feel about myself. And the more insecure I feel. I feel like I am not fun to be around since I am irritable and sad most of the time. I feel like my boyfriend will find someone who has more of the good qualities. I feel that I will never satisfy or make my parents proud, since I keep leaving jobs. They tell me I'm just lazy. I have quit every single thing in my life that I've tried since I was young. But I really think it's because of my mental state. Going out in public is terrifying, because I don't want to feel bad, ugly, unfun, or not funny. I fear social situations, because I am horrible at making conversation. I've been considering therapy and depression/anxiety pills, but my mom tells me people who take them basically just don't feel anything at all. And I am also afraid to see a doctor and share my feelings. I feel like I have no one to talk to. My dad and I have never had a good relationship, we maybe say two words to each other a day. We have had kind of a bad past, and maybe that's the reason for our lack of communication. My boyfriend doesn't really know how to talk about important or emotional things, unless they have to do with him. I feel like every time I cry I push him farther away from me, and feel I have to hide everything because me being depressed is a turn off to him.  I don't know. I guess we all have to vent somewhere, and to know that there is a place where people feel the same is a great thing to me.  I wish there was an easy way to feel good about myself, and just be happy for once. But I suppose these things take time and a lot of effort. I'm sure I left some things out, but this is all I want to throw at you all for now. Thank you for listening.

"It’s not some fucking sadness anymore. This is madness. I remember when I just had a few days when I felt sad and out of it. And I would worry but then everything became better a few days later. Still, I went to a psychologist, because my downs were too consistent to be considered normal.  It all went downhill from there. I feel like I’ve lost a part of myself. My personality, my identity, whatever. I feel like when I talk to others I’m not “there”, like I’ve lost control of what I say and think. Like I’ve lost my mind. Like others are normal and I’m in my own world, going through life on automatic mode, not knowing what I should think, say, or do. Even though from outside people might say I’m completely normal, even sometimes better than before, I feel like mentally, inside, the world is going down. My life is crumbling. Like piece by piece I get further away from a solution. Things that seem to work for others don’t work for me.   I hate it. It’s not just a “bad mood” anymore. It’s feeling like I’ve lost my way, and there’s no signs to get back. Like a loop I can’t get out of. That’s why suicide comes up as an option. When you’re stuck in a loop, the only solution is to shut off. If sleeping is the only thing I enjoy, then why won’t I sleep forever?

"Here's a new update for interested readers. Bad news first: I got a voicemail last week, it said my mother was in the hospital. It took me awhile to get more info, I called and left a message where she lived because it was too late to get anyone on the phone there. I finally found out where she was and called the hospital. They said she was having problems walking, that maybe she hurt her back. That she was getting breathing treatments because she had trouble breathing. Part of it was she couldn't smoke, part of it was probably because she does smoke. They didn't seem to find out what caused the problem with her legs. Then she had some other stuff wrong. Part of the good news was one thing they thought was wrong was caused by a shot they gave her, and it was solved the next day. Now, I called her Friday and she said her heart test showed a tear in a valve. She is getting a more detailed test next week, the doctor said it is too early to tell how serious it is or if it needs anything done to it. He told her, it could be just something minor that needs to be monitored and could cause no problems at all or it could require heart surgery. So I was very worried about that. My first thought when I heard she was in the hospital was that she would end up having cancer from smoking, or liver disease from drinking. But I didn't think of any heart problems. I am hoping that it won't be anything serious, or that if she needs surgery that it will be successful and she will recover without any complications. I don't know much about heart surgery, I know I've heart that many bypass patients have good surgery but get sick and die from complications after the surgery. I hope and pray that she will be ok, I live far from her and can't do anything but call her and pray. Now some good news, my new job is going to switch me to fulltime hours next week. I still have to find out if it will be temporary or long-term, but I'm happy either way. I went from poor and going to be homeless, to having a place to live and a low-stress job in a short time. Each day I wake up and am alive and have a place to live means a lot to me now. It kind of gives me a better perspective on life in a way. I know so many people have it worse, so much suffering in the world and I'm lucky. I have to get some new clothes because changing to fulltime I have to go by a different dress code, so I'll be looking for cheap nice clothes tomorrow. I'm thankful I have some money to look for clothes. I'm still adjusting to things, sometimes I feel like ""where am I, what's going on?"" but it is better than before when I was at my apartment thinking ""when will I get kicked out, where will I live?"" I'm trying to take it one step at a time, not worry about where I'm supposed to be going in life. I'm thinking, what do I need, get things stable, be able to support yourself, get a phone, get car insurance, get more hours at work etc... I try to stay positive and be grateful, but still I'm a little lost. If anyone wants more details about things, or advice on how I've coped with anything just leave a reply and I'll answer you. I have a lot of things I've learned and advice, but I don't go around telling people what to do or pushing my point of view.

Since then we have had some really great times doing things we both love together. Yesterday we finally had the discussion of what was going to happen when she left. In my mind I was hopeful that we could maintain this relationship despite the obvious obstacles. I told her I cared about her more than anyone I have ever dated and said that I wish we had a chance together. She told me she doesn't believe in long distance relationships, this kind of broke my heart but at the same time I knew it was the logical choice in this situation. She told me that she did not want to cut me out of her life and that she wanted to stay in contact with me. She also said that if it was meant to be that it will happen for us. My family has been very hesitant about our relationship because they worry about me spiraling downward when she leaves. I am a little worried about myself as well, today I cried on the way to school and during my break between classes.

"I wish I could have done things differently I graduated high school in June of 2015. Currently I am attending community college and have been doing fairly well so far although I don't know how long I can keep it up. Back in high school I didn't try as hard as I could have resulting in lower grades thus barring my chances of getting into a four year university. Freshmen year of high school I saw my lowest gpa ever I had gotten a 1.8 gpa in the 2nd semester of that year. Hell I was dumb enough in my freshman year to think that I could get away with cheating in my ceramics class but I ended up getting caught. If the university applications saw that I got a D in an art class they would have thought I was a full on retard for trying to apply to a university. It was because of my second semester of freshmen year that I thought my chances of a four year were impossible. I also never bothered to do the ACT/SAT because I thought that with my low gpa it wouldn't have mattered anyway. The following years in hs I've managed to improve a bit but not all that much.      After high school ended I spent a year and a half not really knowing what I was doing taking a class at my community college here and there but not really committing, while also changing my major at least twice. If I play my cards right I'll be able to graduate by he end of May in 2019 and hopefully transfer to a university. But recently I can't help but think of how my life would have been if I had just went straight to a university after high school. I don't have any friends right now and I feel that if I had gone to university out of high school I would have had friends at this point.      Right after high school I didn't really have any second thoughts and what I was doing. I was fine with going to community college and transferring later on but right now I can't help but feel that I've made a huge mistake. If only I had done better in freshmen year I probably would have gotten accepted into university and had a completely different life. I'm only 21 and I already feel like a huge goddamn retard for how I acted in my high school life. If i had taken things more seriously my life right now would have been a lot better.      I feel like I have massively screwed myself. Most of the time now I think about what I could have done differently in high school and what my life would be like now. I honestly hate everything about myself and wish that I could just go back and make things right in high school.

"Ready to just say ""fuck it"" I can't take it anymore. I'm an atheist democrat living in a family of hardcore christian conservatives. Ive made it clear that Im a democrat, to which they just call me a snowflake all the time, which just makes me resent them even more. I dont dare tell them Im am atheist, but Im thinking about it. I dont have anything to live for anymore.   I dont have any idea what to do with my life. I dont have any special talent or skills.

All my friends have at least an idea of what they want to do, but I dont even have the beginnings of a clue as to what I want to do with the rest of my life. And to be honest, Im scared of becoming an adult. Managing a budget, doing taxes, paying bills, and shit like that. Im not fucking prepared for it. If I cant deal with the stress of a fucking video game, then I sure as hell cant deal with a job.   My parents are also hounding me to get a girlfriend. I dont even have a friend who is a girl. All my close friends are male. Hell, the closest Ive came to having a full conversation with a girl is helping her with spanish homework. I aint gay, I just cant talk to girls. The social anxiety makes me want to vomit if I even think about approaching a girl.   So Im ready to fuck it all and just tell my parents Im an atheist.

"exhausted this is my first time posting on this subreddit but I need something to regurgitate everything that I’m feeling as it may be the only thing that stops me from trying to hurt myself. I’ve only slept for about 2 hours and I have to be up for work in 30 minutes which is making me feel worse. As my depression has gotten worse, I find myself sinking further into a place where I have no desire to help or look after myself. I still live at home with my parents and since my mom is aware of my attempts to hurt myself, she has taken on a lot of the responsibilities that I once had for myself. Like cooking for me, cleaning for me, taking me to work sometimes, sleeping in my bed with me. I feel so fucking bad about that, I feel bad for her and I feel bad that she’s really the only person. I have my boyfriend who has been as supportive as he can be, especially because he’s dealing with his own obstacles and  I feel like I’m incapable of being there for him. I keep having thoughts of breaking up with him and becoming so sensitive towards everything he says and it makes me beyond words angry at myself that I have failed him and our relationship. I can’t make me happy, I can’t make him happy and I won’t make anyone happy ever. I am attention and reassurance seeking, I get so angry at the successes of others because I’m not good enough. My identity is shattered and especially because now all I can think about is how sad I am. If I’m on this downward spiral now, will I ever get out of it?? If I have to live with this any longer, I really don’t want to live anymore. Everyday I entertain the idea of being in a car accident because I want people to take care of me and love me but I also hate that I want that and wish so badly to be okay with not needing validation and approval from others. I attempted to overdose recently and all I thought about was someone finding me dead on the floor and hoping they would feel bad. I couldn’t even think of how this would affect my poor mother who has been through so much with my ungrateful attenuation seeking ass. Im so grossed out with myself. I’m eating at myself and letting myself go, I keep picking and scratching and slapping myself because I don’t think I deserve to get better. I deserve to hurt because I’m a sad sack of shit who has NOTHING to be sad about. I have everything I could ever need in life and I’m still complaining like an ingrate. I fucking hate myself so much, there is someone out there who deserves my own life more than I do. I’m going to start antidepressants I was prescribed re cently and am in therapy (I don’t go as often as I probably should) and while that is good, I’m almost scared of getting better just to get worse again. I’m scared of going on antidepressants because I’d rather feel so much than feel nothing at all which is my predicament. If this doesn’t work, if I keep waking up depressed and if I continue to get worse, I really want to just die. I have no friends, they all live far away and I think they only care because I think they can tell I’m depressed based on some statuses I’ve posted. My boyfriend continues to be loving towards me, but I always feel like he only does now because he doesn’t want to hurt me. He says he wants me to get better and be more confident, and I can’t help but feel that maybe he deserves someone who is more confident. He reminisces on the past and is always talking about wanting to travel and I can’t help but feel so bad thinking that I won’t be involved in those plans because I’m not a fun person to be around. People have reassured me that I am more than enough but I’m not, I’m not I don’t believe them.

"My formative years were spent in small towns. Until the third grade, I lived in Indiana. From the third grade through my junior year in high school, I lived in a small lakeside community in southwestern Michigan. You could walk or ride your bike to anywhere - down to the lake, out on country roads, wherever. My father was a Lutheran school teacher, principal and church organist. From time to time, he would take a ""call"" to serve in another Lutheran school in a different town. In the summer of 1968, right after my junior year in high school, he decided to take a call to a school in the north side of the city of St. Louis. It was quite a culture shock for a sheltered young woman who had only lived in small, insular towns all her life, to move to a city the size of St. Louis. Quite honestly, when we arrived here I absolutely hated it. I felt as if I'd been thrown to the dark side of the moon. I had to start my senior year in a new high school in a completely foreign environment. Everyone else already had their group or circle of friends going back at least three years. Now you had to have a lot more guts and fortitude and self-esteem than I had at the time to break into already established groups and make new friends. This was the year that would set the stage for the first major depressive episode in my life. This was the year of my first therapist, the first of many to come.

"I hate it when bad people get rewarded One of the facts that depresses me most about life is when bad people get rewarded and live comfortably, and loved by all.  It's hard for me to stomach.   For example, I saw one of my former bullies enter the store I work at. She was absolutely terrible toward me when we were in high school, such as defacing my sketchbook, purposefully kicking my food away, sending me fake ""love letters"", and more. Anyway, the bully now had two children (I'm having trouble conceiving so that stings), and I think the bully could smell my fear because she headed right to my counter, and began to make a show of how expensive everything was in our store while also ""catching up"" by telling me about how successful she is with her self made interior design business.

"Hi I'm Ricky, I'm 17 years old and I think I've been living with depression for the past 2 years. I've been through a lot of issues in my life that makes my life feel so unbearable and lonely. I haven't been through any therapy so I haven't been diagnosed with depression but I obviously haven't been feeling happy. I'm a senior in high school and I hate going to school every morning, I don't feel like I fit in really. Reasons are because I'm a social outcast and I don't really like being around other people because I may seem to be off tangent. People seem to judge me too quickly and this really pisses me off, or is it that I'm way too paranoid. I zone out a lot and just stare at people without even saying a word to any of them. Like I'm really anxious around them and I feel completely uncomfortable. I started smoking weed when I was a sophomore and ever since then people such as my friends seem to drift away but it didn't really bother me till now. I don't really have that many close friends other than just friends that I smoke with. My parents say I should avoid those friends just so I can get a better perspective in my life but then I don't know how to make new ones. I really want to make new ones because I want to have a better social life but I don't know how to get myself motivated. I want someone to care for like a girl friend, just so that I don't feel so lonely, but then again I don't think I can have a healthy relationship. My parents also say that I should be more open with God but I don't have any faith (if I don't even have any faith in myself, how could I have any with God).

"According to the mental health nurse i'm not depressed So since october 2016 i've been (or at least thought I had) been depressed. I dropped out of school, started self harming and was put in hospital twice among other things. I spent nearly the whole of 2017 at home doing nothing because I simply couldn't. I got a full time job in september but I hated it and it made me worse and I had to quit after I started self harming again and have been cutting up until now (i'm 18 by the way if that's important).  Things have been getting worse again recently. I'm cutting almost every night and feel down and just cant do anything. I don't even have the energy to shower most days and just stay in bed until the late afternoon. However I was hopeful for today as I was going to see a new nurse who I was hoping would be able to set up a plan to help me. I was with the child services before and had an amazing nurse who helped me greatly but as i'm 18 i'm classed as an adult so have to go to the adult services.   So as soon as I met the new nurse and we went into the room to talk she told me she knows almost nothing about me despite there being many notes from the past year. I told her about leaving my job and feeling low and the self harm and everything and what she basically told me is ''you aren't depressed''. She said that my self harm was normal as it was just scratches and I wasn't cutting deep enough to leave any scars which just completely confused me considered i'd been put in hospital partly for doing the same thing before. I've also suffered with terrible social anxiety all my life and find it very hard to communicate with others. I told her the only friends i've ever had was the friends I've made years ago when I first started going to school and what she said was it sounds like I have great social skills as i've been able to make friends. It honestly felt like she wasn't listening to a single word I was saying. As I said she had no notes from before and was basically just assuming what was wrong with me and that was it. Also I should add i'm in the UK so this is with the NHS so i'm not paying for this however my parents have said they would be willing to pay for some sessions with a therapist if that's was I need.  I'm sorry if this is long or it just sounds like i'm complaining. I just wanted other peoples opinions on this as I just don't know what to think.

"42 year old male newbie, just discovering that I suffer from depression. While there has been evidence all throughout my life, and while I have family members that have suffered from depression (grandmother committed suicide), I for some reason am just figuring out now that I suffer from the disease. My questions for those much more experienced and knowledgeable on the forum. 1. How would you go about your initial steps of diagnosis and treatment? I currently do not have med insurance, so cost is certainly an issue (we should have medical insurance in place in about a month, as part of my wife's new employer package). 2. I take a healthy dose of vitamins daily, including proteins such as L-Tyrosine, which helps me feel really good when I'm not under the effects of depression. Does anyone on the forum have experience with L-Tyrosine and its impact on their feelings of depression? I understand that the amino acids help with the production of dopamine and helps with brain function. Any comments? A little background: I am just coming off a very successful 4 year period where I started a complicated new business and got married again. However, during these last few months I have been unable to work at my previous pace, putting my business in real jeopardy. In fact, there are only a couple of days per week where I seem to be able to work, and typically only a few hours at a time during those days. When I do work I get exhausted quickly. Today, I had a major conference call that required some preparation. I was very up during the call, but then collapsed afterward in complete exhaustion. Seems to be the story for me recently, I can psych myself up for short bursts of performance, then I quickly decline again in an inability to concentrate on anything other than light web surfing. I continue to get up early and exercise daily. I live a healthy lifestyle, eat well, and walk 5+ miles every morning. I sleep regular hours, however, will sleep a few hours during the day during my 'down' days.  Looking back at my past, I am now clearly seeing times in my life where my performance level went down drastically, or where I had problems with relationships. At the time, I didn't realize anything was going on, or I simply didn't understand it. I can now go recall having real problems with my grades during my freshman year of high school. At the time, I recall saying to myself that I couldn't understand why I was performing so badly. It was as it something was holding me back and I could not overcome it. At the time, I just kept studying and working harder, but I was unsuccessful. Eventually, I got through it and my grades went back to normal. But all of these years I never really understood what happened in that freshman year, until now. In summary, there have been many other times in my life where things have fallen apart and I have not understood why. My past is littered by successful businesses that I have created and then have eventually failed, usually by my inability to maintain my performance level. There has obviously been a pattern that I do not yet understand, but at least now I am beginning to see why there was a downturn. Thankfully, I have now met the women of every man's dreams. While she knows I am depressed I have not yet let her know the depths of my despair or of my recent understanding of my past behavior. The good news here is that I have great family support, but I am wrestling with how much to tell my wife about what is going on inside my head. She gets stressed easily and will worry deeply about me. I'm not sure I want to lay that all out on her. Anyone else find themselves in this dilemma?

"We have been playing Quake 4 almost every night for a little while. We play online against other players using Xbox Live and it is very cool. Most people are friendly. We have made some 'friends' and we find them and play with them. One time I found some person talking too much trash and you can go in a mute them or set a preference to never see them again. Well, last night I encountered a group who had a feud going. One kid was talking too much trash and people on the other side were just going with it. I figured one game was a not a big deal. But sometimes you end up finding them again and again in the same night. I have this guy some slack and didn't say anything but then later I got to play as part of the same team with him. What a jerk. He kept asking me to give him the flag so he score it and get the points instead of me. Forget about the team winning, this guy wanted all the points for himself and didn't care about the team. I had to set him straight, and after the game I had to report him as being a trash player and set in my preferences to never see him again. After that I saw the other players and they were all nice. It only takes one guy to ruin a great experience. Overall, playing online with all these people and talking with them is great, you just have to know when to cut someone loose. Eventually when many people report him as being a jerk, he will be banned from the game.

"I can absolutely relate to what you're going through. I understand how difficult it is adjusting to so many different personalities. Ten people in one apartment is overwhelming, to say the least. I used to live with four other girls who had diverse interests, and unfortunately we all kept to ourselves because of the different personalities. It was best that way. In your case, it seems like you're making as much effort as you can to be social. There's no need to go out on a limb to prove that you're not anti-social. When I had depression I really needed my space and the last thing I wanted to do was socialize with my roommates. Luckily, I am in my own apartment and have been living alone for three years now. It has helped enormously. I wonder if you can request a transfer to a bachelor suite where you can live by yourself. I did that in my 3rd year and the apartment manager put me on a waiting list, and I was able to get my own living space by November. Even though the moving was a hassle, I never regretted it. As for finding ways to spend time away from the noise of other people, I usually take the bus to visit a bookstore that is far away from campus. I go there every weekend to relax and read. It's away from campus life and it has helped me sort out my thoughts. The suggestions made by others such as the library, and a park are wonderful too. Maybe you can purchase a bus pass? I have depression and social anxiety, so it was difficult dealing with the university atmosphere on my own. I made only a couple of friends who have since moved on or graduated. I too saw a school counselor, but it was short-lived. What helped me, other than getting away from campus, was getting some online support from forums such as this one. I also kind of clung to one friend at a time, instead of many groups of people. I'd go to the movie theatre and watch something funny, or I'd take long walks. You're not alone. Hang in there and keep posting if you feel really down.

"I've lost 4 Marines to depression and almsost lost a 5th. None saw combat. I need help understanding. Hi.   I just had my 4th funeral in 7 years for yet another Marine. A few days ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down.  These 5 Marines, as far as i can tell suffer/suffered from depression. Pretty much every one of them was intelligent (like way too smart for the Marine Corps) and each of them stood out as ""the funny one"". To say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement.   The Marine Corps has done a lot to try and help suicidal Marines, but all our training videos depict some ""clearly distressed"" person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves. In reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help.  What I'm asking:  As someone who has never suffered depression (Ive been ""depressed"" but that was from external factors like a job not working out or a girl leaving me. I consider that normal human emotion), how do I identify Marines under my care thst may be suffering and need help.  They are NOT giving the outward signs in the stupid ""Lance Corporal Decker video"" we watch once a year.  Thanks.  Edit: been at work all day then went to visit a former Marine that dealt with some serious issues in his day but is doing well now. Mulled over a lot of this with him, then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful responses.  I have read every one, some several times. I have a lot to consider and learn, but thank you for helping me find some direction.  One thing i didn't mention is my role in all this. Im not sone big wig commander with tools at my disposal.  Im a newly promoted Sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guys under me. The one we just burried was not in my platoon, but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss. The other three were guys i was close to back in training, but i was not currently stationed with them when it happened. In fact i found out about all three of them on Facebook.   This recent one, and the one that called me with suicidal thoughts, have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me. The scary thing to me is, even with hindsight, i wouldn't have picked these five guys out of the lot as having ANY kind of issues, let alone suicidal tendencies.   I have also noticed, maybe because of my nature or leadership style, that im the one people tend come to with problems. I make it known that im here for that purpose, and people take me up on it. So I guess now i want to make sure i can spot when someone needs more help than they may be openly asking for. I will be more vigilant in my assessments of the needs of those under my watch.  Thank you all for the detailed and informed replies.

"My Mom shot herself. Hi forum, I am going through alot right now and have no idea what to do. I will tell you the story, its a long one.. I hope you are willing to read.  I am 32 years old, I was very close to my mother.. We had a bond that was as strong as steel. My dad whom she was with since the age of 15 left her 11 years ago for another woman and found happiness. She had never been with any other man. I have an older sister that is 42 and we had different relationships. My mother was angry and could never get over my dad, year after year we would hear how much she hated him but still loved him, she would wish they could be one again. It never happened, she had been with no one and remained lonley for 11 years. Her depression became her life, it was so bad we would stop talking to her because all she would talk about is killing herself and how she hated my dad. 10 years of it, She had little money and was very sick, She went from healthy to brittle in a matter of 10 years. Back surgery's, aching bones, depression, pain pain and more pain. It became up to me and my sister to take care of her, she couldn't drive so we always had to drive over to take her to the dr, groceries or to get things she needed, it became stressfull and we would somtimes bicker over it..even after the divorce my dad helped when he wanted to or could.  She started thinking she was a burden.. then started lashing out on us at times, I went a whole year not speaking to her until she called me to apologize for her horrible words with me. I forgave her and we began a relationship again...this time it was amazing again, we got along and finally after 10 years she accepted my partner. Long story short drama hit the fan again in early Nov this year. Things were said between her and my sister and they got me involved, I got upset with my mom and she was so hurt and thought that I thought she was a liar. My sister told me she said something about my son that she claimed she didn't. I didn't care after a while, I had plans with her on the day before thanksgiving to go see her.. on the 19th of NOV. She asked on the 19th if i could come hook up her VCR so she could watch A Christmas Story, I told her next weekend, then she later that night got upset again, she texted all of us the usual suicide talk. I had told her the day before that I didn't want anymore drama, if i went over with my family I didn't want to hear about my dad and sister. I just wanted to have a good time. She then texted me and a lot of other family that she loved me. that it wasn't my fault, she bought the gun... (I took her to get that gun for protection so I always told her if she did that I would feel to blame) She would say "" SON I bought it! Dont feel to blame"" I hated that! Still I never belived she would do it.. I was so bitter about her not wanting to be possitive I hadent called her. I ignored her suicide text and just decided to let her cool off.. 20th, 21st-29th we hadnt spoken.. I had a bad feeling but didnt know why.. she hadnt called.. so i figured she was angry with me.. I get a call from my aunt on my dads side who she was very close with.. ""Is it true? The rumors about your mom?"" I was picking up my kids from school.. I said ""huh? what she say about me this time hahaha?"" ""Call your sister"" she said.. I called and she told me to go home right away.. Then she said when getting home "" Mom... mom... *cries*... Moms dead.. she killed herself"" I said ""dont say that"" about 12 times breaking down more and more each time I repeated it.. I fell apart crying for who know how long... day one was hard, day two was harder, day 3 was numb and empty and I couldn't cry or sleep, day 4 I then hit a new horrible moment.. I found out she had been in her apartment dead since the 20th.. the complex lied and said no one heard anything and thats another story.. they are being sued soon.. her body was in there so long that we will not have an open casket this week in her funeral.. Then i went into her apartment to start gathering her things.. i smelled the death and decay.. I have never felt so sick and horrified in my life. I will never forget it.. i went to where she did it and saw the carpet cut out and her bed gone.. her place was left just like I last saw it.. it killed me.. I am now on day 6 and her ceremony is tomorrow in her home town.. Idk what to think or feel anymore.. my wife is trying to support me cause her mom died when she was 17 but i am changing.. She can see it, I dont want to run my company, I dont sleep, I have this numb feeling.. I cry out of no where.. I can not stop picturing her lifeless body, I cant stop thinking ""was she in pain?"" picturing her bleed out her exit wound for over a week.. I cry and can not stop.. I feel like dying.. I feel so empty and full of rage.. I wounder why she left me here..  I wish I could of took it back, I feel its my fault I should have went over or called..

"Zoloft made me fly off the handle I have episodes of clinical depression that last a few weeks alternating with episodes of being euphoric, having so much energy, and thinking I am the greatest person in the world and I have superpowers. It’s awesome but has issues of its own because I tend to make poor choices, act conceited/rude without realizing it, and sometimes get angry.  I was on Zoloft for a short time (age 11-12) and it made me a little less depressed but caused me to do horrible things impulsively, act spoiled and stuck up, and have frequent fits of rage. I attempted suicide within the first month of taking meds. I developed anorexia, made poor sexual and financial decisions, and was fired from my Saturday job as a babysitter because I was yelling at the kids, teaching them how to swear and bragging about it to other teachers, and trying to flirt with the children’s fathers. At school I told everyone I had superpowers and raged at them when they said that my superpowers were not real. I had arguments with my parents and pulled out a knife to threaten them at one point. I had a boyfriend but was still flirting with other boys constantly including my teachers. I tried to “rapebait” by going into the house of a suspected molester/murderer/drug dealer but was stopped thankfully. After going off meds I crashed and burned HARD.

"Hi, I have posted a few responses on the forum, but this will be my first thread. I guess I am wondering if I truly suffer from depression or another mental illness. I have not seen a psychologist or a therapist, but I have been reading your threads for the last few weeks. My heart goes out to you and I wish that I could lend more support than I can. I know that my situation is not nearly as dire as many of you, but I still ponder whether I have a iproblemi. For the last couple of years, I have experienced an increase in mood swings. I will be doing fine and then a ilight switchi goes off, and I get a bad case of the blues. These can last for a few of days. In my mind, I know that everything is actually okay, but I can't shake the idowni feeling. I also have frequent bouts of being istressed-outi. By this I mean that all of the tasks that I need to get done seem to be insurmountable and that there will never be enough time to get things done. I sometimes break down in tears during my more manic attacks of frustration and worry. Life seems to have become one long list of stuff to do. Even the fun stuff has become something to get done so that I can move on to the next day. As for itriggersi, as I have been reading about in your posts, I know that I have two major issues. I don't deal well with my emotions when my husband gets angry (not abusive, just normal iguy angryi) or I feel that I have somehow iscrewed-upi and let him down by not doing something right. I turn very inward and the ilight switchi goes off. My second issues deals with embarrassment. I do not take embarrassment well. My stress/anxiety over getting the housework done stems from my concern that people may come over and I will be embarrassed by the state of the house (in fact, the house is always neat and clean, if a bit disheveled by daily life). I often worry about whether I embarrassed myself during social outings or at parties with my friends. My husband reassures me, but that doesn't usually ease my worry. My ObGyn gave me Sarafem (Prozac 20mg) three weeks ago, and I seem to be operating on a more even keel these days.

It makes time slow down just for a little, and stops the incessant flow of (mostly negative) thoughts. There's so much beauty left to see. It can be as amazing as the the clear blue waters surrounding a tropical island. It could be as mundane as a flock of birds flying in harmony over your roof.

"Beautifully Broken I’ve spent most of my life afraid to be my true self because I believed that if I didn’t live up to the standards and norms that I grew up with, I wouldn’t be accepted. I was told since a young age how I should act, talk, and dress. I was told that money was important and that attending societal events and bullshit balls was your key to social success. And those things, trying to “feel” important, had meant everything to me.  But then life screws you over and suddenly your perspective on everything changes. I learned that I no longer wanted to be the person that everyone said I had to be and things that had once seemed important became trivial. I realized that I didn’t give a fuck if I had Tory Burch shoes or a Chanel bag. No amount of money could ever bring me happiness, which was clearly evident in the money that was spent on “I’m sorry” shopping trips and my therapist.  Things started falling apart at home when I was 15 years old. So my remedy to broken family was to drink until I couldn’t feel. But despite my new fond love of alcohol and its pain killing effects, I kept my life together. I worked hard in school, I stayed active in my community, and I made sure people thought I was keeping it together. I couldn’t let everyone know that I was a fucking mess. But in this process, I slowly lost myself and started living two different lives. When the curtains were wide open, people saw a girl that was very studious, had many accomplishment’s, and always had a smile on her face. But as soon as the curtains closed and I was alone, my demons came out. And the more I hid, the more I lost myself.  At one point, the alcohol wasn’t enough. Things had only gotten worse at home and I needed a new escape. The first time I did it, it was a pair of scissors. It was small, barely noticeable. I had sworn after the first time that I would never hurt myself again. But eventually I did, and when I left for college it had only gotten worse.  By my second year of college, I had reached my lowest point. I was in a toxic, emotionally abusive, relationship. I had a broken relationship with my parents, who spent most of their time stuck in a cycle of fighting, not speaking, and then pretending that they were okay. I hadn’t spoken to my older brother, a struggling addict at the time, in almost a year. I no longer knew who I was. So one night I went out and bought a bottle of wine with my fake ID and went back to my apartment and chugged the entire thing. I sat on my bathroom floor crying, staring at the knife in my hand. And in the back of my mind I thought about the gun that was a few feet away from me hidden in a book that my dad had given me for protection. For the first time in my life, I had looked at mortality straight in the face. I had questioned it many times, but it was never like that night.  Eventually the crying stopped and the numbness came, a feeling I had become all too familiar with.  Would I do it?  Could I do it?  Would anyone care?  I was consumed with darkness, but there was a small flicker of light, of hope. I wanted to help people, I wanted to one day to change the world, or at the very least change one person’s life. I wasn’t ready to leave just yet, so I held on to the tiny amount of hope that was left in me. I called the cops and was admitted into a psychiatric center. I spent 48 hours in a white walled, emotionless, prison like place. And not once did someone ask me if I was okay.  My parents came up to see me and had a difficult time accepting what had happened and I didn’t understand why. They knew I wanted help, they saw the scars on my arms, and they knew that I wasn’t okay.  They blamed my relationship with my then boyfriend and told me to never speak of this to anyone. They didn’t want people to know I was “crazy”. Was I? During that time, I came to believe I was, but now I understand that I was just broken.  It’s been over three years since that happened and although I still struggled with a lot after that, I’m now in a better place.  The reason I am writing this is because I promised myself to one day help the 15-year-old me whose cries for help where tossed to the side, who was told she was over-dramatic and crazy, and who thought that cutting was the only way to cope. There was a reason I grew up surrounded by mental illness. I watched not only myself go through it, but I saw my brother, my parents, my friends, and so many people on the news struggling with their own demons. And this didn’t happen because life felt like fucking me over, it was just trying to show me what my reason for living is.  I spent years ashamed of the person I was because I was scared to show people my true, raw, fucked up self. But isn’t that the problem? When it comes to having a mental illness, we believe the stigmas that come attached to it and we’re afraid to speak up and talk about it. And the people who are lucky enough to not experience it, don’t want to talk about it either. The only difference from how mental illness was treated a hundred years ago and now, is that we no longer hide and chain our family members in basements or attics, but the shame and embarrassment is still there.  And I want to change that. I want to remove the stigmas and stereotypes attached to mental illness and get people talking. But change starts with me, and that means that I can’t be afraid to share my experiences.  This is who I am and I wouldn’t change my life for anything in the world because now I truly understand what it’s like to live with a mental illness. I finally know what the difference between sympathy and empathy is, and that is one of the greatest gifts that could have come out from this.  I will be exploring different topics on mental illness while trying to find ways to change the way people think and talk about it. I will not only be looking at the psychological background of mental illness, but the neurological background as well. More and more scientists are publishing articles on different alternative treatments that don’t involve medications. One of my favorite topics, which I will soon explore in more detail, is neuroplasticity, or the brains way of re-wiring itself to create new circuits, and essentially a new you. I’ve set a goal to one day create a facility for those who are afflicted with a mental illness. But instead of white walls, cold stares from employees, and isolation, they will be surrounded by beautiful colors, the outdoors, and people who actually care.  Our current mental health system is completely and utterly fucked up. We can’t keep over-medicating people and throwing them out into the world with absolutely no regard for their actual well-being. If these “treatments” were actually working, we wouldn’t be seeing an alarmingly increasing rate of mental illness.  It’s time to re-define mental illness and stick a middle finger up to all the people who tell you that you’re crazy or different.  And maybe I am crazy, I’m sure as hell different, but that doesn’t make me any less of a person. I’m proud of who I have become and now I know what the purpose of my life is, and I’m not going to stop chasing it.  -RBZ  “Sometimes the most beautiful people are beautifully broken” -r.m. drake   ",beautifully broken spent life afraid true self believed did not live standard norm grew with not accepted told young age act talk dress told money important attending societal event bullshit ball key social success thing trying feel important meant me life screw suddenly perspective change learned longer wanted person said thing important trivial realized did not fuck tory burch shoe chanel bag money bring happiness clearly evident money spent sorry shopping trip therapist thing started falling apart home year old remedy broken family drink not feel despite new fond love alcohol pain killing effect kept life together worked hard school stayed active community sure people thought keeping together not let know fucking mess process slowly lost started living different life curtain wide open people saw girl studious accomplishment is smile face soon curtain closed alone demon came out hid lost myself point alcohol not enough thing gotten worse home needed new escape time did it pair scissors small barely noticeable sworn time hurt again eventually did left college gotten worse second year college reached lowest point toxic emotionally abusive relationship broken relationship parent spent time stuck cycle fighting not speaking pretending okay not spoken older brother struggling addict time year longer knew wa night went bought bottle wine fake id went apartment chugged entire thing sat bathroom floor cry staring knife hand mind thought gun foot away hidden book dad given protection time life looked mortality straight face questioned time like night eventually cry stopped numbness came feeling familiar with it it care consumed darkness small flicker light hope wanted help people wanted day change world change person life not ready leave just yet held tiny hope left me called cop admitted psychiatric center spent hour white walled emotionless prison like place not did ask okay parent came difficult time accepting happened did not understand why knew wanted help saw scar arm knew not okay blamed relationship boyfriend told speak anyone did not want people know crazy i time came believe wa understand just broken year happened struggled lot that better place reason writing promised day help yearold cry help tossed side told overdramatic crazy thought cutting way cope reason grew surrounded mental illness watched not it saw brother parent friend people news struggling demon did not happen life felt like fucking over just trying reason living is spent year ashamed person scared people true raw fucked self not problem come having mental illness believe stigma come attached afraid speak talk it people lucky not experience it not want talk either difference mental illness treated year ago now longer hide chain family member basement attic shame embarrassment there want change that want remove stigma stereotype attached mental illness people talking change start me mean afraid share experience not change life world truly understand like live mental illness finally know difference sympathy empathy is greatest gift come this exploring different topic mental illness trying way change way people think talk it not looking psychological background mental illness neurological background well scientist publishing article different alternative treatment not involve medication favorite topic soon explore detail neuroplasticity brain way rewiring create new circuit essentially new you set goal day create facility afflicted mental illness instead white wall cold stare employee isolation surrounded beautiful color outdoors people actually care current mental health completely utterly fucked up overmedicating people throwing world absolutely regard actual wellbeing treatment actually working not seeing alarmingly increasing rate mental illness time redefine mental illness stick middle finger people tell crazy different maybe crazy sure hell different doe not make person proud know purpose life is not going stop chasing it rbz beautiful people beautifully broken rm drake,0.5039091110229492,0.45602554082870483,0.4333242177963257

"My Daughter turned 30 today.  I called and sent her a card, but she is not speaking to me.  Reason being ...

"Told my mother I tried to kill myself, she admitted she also tried when i was a baby. I've been struggling with this  sickness for a while, it cost me my job, and a few friends, but only now i can publicly say that i tried to kill myself on the 19th of February. I tried to hang myself with a belt, fortunatelly i bought a really shitty one at primark and the only thing it did was leave me on the floor gasping desperatelly for air, filled with a sense of failure and a huge shame. I've always been an outgoing, funny, talkative and very active guy and i just felt as is i runned out of batery like something was leaving me without lifeforce.  After some therapy i decided to tell my mother about this. I went for a visit to my parents house and waited until we were alone to tell her basically what i've been writing above. Also told her that the biggest fear i had before doing it was that if i died my mother would also died just out of pure sadness. After we both cried for a while she dropped the bomb.  She had been struggling with depression all her life without me or my sister knowing about it and it came a point where she even tried of doing the same. The thing that stopped her was their children and what we would do with 12 and 8 years alone. She also told me that my grandfather didn't die of cancer, apparently he was an alcoholic, and when we where kids he threw himself at the well they had on the backyard.  All this just made me realize that people don't kill themselves, depression kills people the same way cancer does. People who haven't struggled with this can't even imagine what is living with depression and often blame a person who is basically ill.   My mother also gave me the best advice i've ever recieved. She told me that I wasn't on this earth just to find a job and live the best way i could just by buying things, that it didn't matter if i didn't find a huge reason to live; just by being there i was already the reason for my mother and many others to live and be happy,  the same way she was for me. That even just by smiling at the guy at the supermarket i was already making him a bit happier even though it would only be a few seconds, and that should be enough.

I've never felt more alone in my life and I don't know what to do about it. I recently graduated high school with a decent amount of friends but have only really kept in touch with about 3 of them. I'm going to a college two hours away so the likelihood that I'll be able to even see those 3 people is kind of dwindling once I move.   I used to deal with loneliness through friends on PlayStation but even those relationships feel like they're getting distant. I recently started talking to my former best friend from PS4 whom I've known for about 7 years but ever since he started seeing someone it feels like he's gotten meaner to me and doesn't care to be there for me in the same way anymore.   I'm not sure if I'm depressed but I've never felt more alone or lost or confused in my life. I've managed to convince myself that I have no redeeming qualities and that my friends are only pretending to like me because they feel bad or somehow feel obligated to maintain a facade of friendship.   I just want to feel important to someone. Or at least okay enough with myself that I don't need the validation of a relationship to feel valuable.  ,felt life not know it recently graduated high school decent friend really kept touch them going college hour away likelihood able people kind dwindling move used deal loneliness friend playstation relationship feel like getting distant recently started talking best friend p known year started seeing feel like gotten meaner doe not care way anymore not sure depressed felt lost confused life managed convince redeeming quality friend pretending like feel bad feel obligated maintain facade friendship just want feel important someone okay not need validation relationship feel valuable,0.5001674294471741,0.4424305558204651,0.5706662535667419

"I'm new here, and I ought for help.  For the past month I've had a crush on this girl  .. but not a normal crush .. a real CRUSH CRUSH, the type of crush you really feel you need her since the first time you see her. She is my friend as of right now, I want to ask her out  .. but I am afraid she rejects me, and she wouldn't be my friend anymore.  I've been with depression for the past 4 days already, I even had suicidal thoughts. Last night I was looking for a HotLine to call and tell my story, I felt like I needed to talk to somebody.   I have friends, but not those type of friends that you can rely on, tell your story, and cry on their shoulders. Basically, i'm by myself in this world.  I love my parents, but I never tried talking about it because I just can't. They wouldn't understand, they ask too many questions .. we even had a minor discussion about me telling my mom NOT to throw the water bottle (I told her 5 times not to throw it), and guess what she did .. she threw the water bottle .. and she told ""rrAhh, you should've told me"" .. Bad communication indeed, she needs to pay more attention to what I say.  I haven't eaten for a day because the depression has gotten worse .. last night a good ""cyber - friend"" logged on, and I knew I could talk to that person .. she's not kid, she's a grown woman (40 years old), she has kids, so I knew she would understand perfectly. She talked me into not thinking about suiciding because of that.  Last night was the day that I cried the most, in my entire life. I'm still depressed, a little bit relieved because I actually talked to someone and let all that out.  I just need advices, I've been thinking of that girl ALL the time .. I wrote her letters as a ""secret admirer"", the ending of the letter was always the same: ""To the world you might be one person, but to one person you might be the world.""  I was also thinking that I was going to ask her out .. but like I said above, I'm afraid she might reject me and I fall into a deeper depression.  Please help, what should I do?  I'm 16, and I live in Miami.  Thank you if you have read my story.  EDIT: I have lost my self - respect, and lowered my self - esteem, and feel like if I'm a nobody.

"Hello everyone, I am new here. I am Sarah and in my early thirties. I live in Europe and found this forum today! I just want to share my thoughts and because I was afraid anyone would find out about my feelings I searched for a foreign forum. And found it! I have been struggling all my life but after a series of events (death of dear aunt and suicide attempt off parent) I found myself starting therapy almost 2 years ago. At first everything was fine and I was learning a lot about myself and how to make my life easier and how to love myself. i really was hopeful and thought my life would finally get happier and maybe I would even meet some one to share my life with.... After a year of therapy I started feeling worse about myself and developed an eating disorder and a few months ago I also started feeling more and more depressed. At first I denied everything and even threatened to quit therapy because I was convinced time would heal me....well I now know that healing is not that easy. over the past two weeks I have been to a psychiatrist who wants to start me on Prozac (because it shouldn't make me gain weight, she thinks this would be the best ad. for me) and earlier this week i went to see my usual psychotherapist who said I was severely depressed and she urged me to start taking the medication because of my state of mind. I might loose my job in the near future and with all this extra stress my thoughts have been very scary. I am starting to think more and more about death and for this reason my therapist started talking about hospitalization! Off course I don't want that so I agreed earlier today to start with the medication....I am so scared about the side effects and don't know what i will do if I gain weight. Also I don't think I want to life if I loose my job...I think that will push me over the edge.  I hope I can find the energy to read more messages on this board and maybe get a good feeling about life again.

"Hi all... this is going to be a long post, but I'd really like some feedback on it... I'm kind of young, 17. I'm currently involved in a relationship (long distance) with a boy who's a year older than me, and I love him more than words can say. The thing is, though, I'm a very depressed person sometimes.  I don't know if I'm making this up or if I actually read this somewhere, but I'm what I've heard classified as a ""seasonally"" depressed person: I experience depression more during the winter months (December through February) than I do any other time of the year. I have a lot of family problems that compound to my depression as well. When I was 13, I moved halfway across the country and I never accepted living here. I'm a city-girl, but I moved to the country. I feel isolated and alone out here, and I don't have anyone to talk to. My mother told me to ""buck up"" and ""get over it"" when I went to her about my depression a couple of years ago. She's currently on medication for her own depression. My father has a crippled arm (which he gained when we moved here) and has some addiction problems, so I don't go to him.  I have a very hard time trusting people. My mother and father were both abused as children, and my mother verbally abuses me. Recently, starting in about December, I started wanting to hurt myself physically again. The urge faded, but the depression lingered. For a while I've been emulating my mother on my boyfriend--I keep taking out my own anger and my own depression on him. I'm afraid that if I keep up with this behavior, I'm going to lose my boyfriend to my own selfishness. A lot of the time I wish I could disappear. I don't like being seen by people and I like to be alone, but at the same time I feel isolated in my soul. I tried religion, but I can't bring myself to place my faith in something I can't see. I'm really afraid that my depression is going to cause me to lose the one thing I even care about at all anymore in the world. I don't know what to do. My parents won't help me, my teachers don't know how to deal with it, and I've been to depression forums like this before and they really helped. I guess all I'm looking for is someone to lean on while I get through the winter months. If anyone has any suggestions for a homebody (my parents don't allow me to leave the house after school is over), please let me know. Also keep in mind that I can't call people very easily with eavesdropping people in my house. Thanks.

"This message is especially for newcomers desperately seeking a way out of the depression rut. Please read my words carefully as a lot of thought and devotion went into this:  A year ago, I was stuck in the miserable rut of depression with little or no hope of finding a way out. I was attending mandatory group therapy after an attempted suicide and 72 miserable hours in the nut house. They put me on Remeron which helped a little ... taking some of the edge off the suicidal thoughts, but little else. Weeks of trying to learn cognitive behavior therapy went by and hopes of getting better were dwindling. Then one day, my best friend gave me a book which taught me how to properly apply the CBT. Many of you have tried CBT to no avail. I sincerely believe that you did not do it either properly, hard enough, and / or long enough. When retraining the mind, it's vitally important to diligently apply CBT daily for several weeks. (See my webpage for more info: Antidepressant That Works). Once this becomes a regular habit, I'm confident you will see improvement as I did. I'm positive you can do it too. It was the toughest job I've ever had to do, but it sure was worth it. Whenever a negative situation presents itself now, I just block it out and replace it with a positive thought automatically. It's hard in the beginning, but it's totally do - able. Plus, it gets easier after awhile. Then, once it becomes automatic, you don't even have to think about it.  Properly applied CBT helps tremendously, but it's not a complete cure as you will see in my story. You must also take care of your body because it's what furnishes your brain with the proper nutrients. The two go hand in hand. The brain regulates the endocrine system and the neurotransmitters while the body provides the brain with the proper chemicals to do its job.  Leisure activities help also. I know it's difficult for some of you to have fun, but it's important to get your mind off your problems even if just for a little while. I mention motivation in my story. Sometimes you just have to force yourself to do what's good for you even if you don't want to. Contrary to what many believe, motivation begins with action ... not visa - versa. The sooner you begin to properly apply the techniques I learned and the more effort you put in to them, the sooner you will get better. Hopelessness and doubt will be your enemy, so try to put them aside for a month as you get on the road to wellness.  I have been off antidepressants for almost a year now. I feel great ... plus my concentration and comprehension are back. March 5 marked my one year anniversary without alcohol too. I'm basically drug free and am as happy as I was 5 years ago before the depression nearly ruined my life.

"I need to get this out. Feel free to ignore it.(Potential Triggers: Domestic and parental abuse, self harm, bullying, substance abuse etc. Avoiding detail AMAP) I am so sick of trying to just survive each day. I want more than anything to go out and live my life. I want a job, an apartment, a pet... but instead I’m stuck living with my grandparents because I’m at the point where my agoraphobia is so bad I can BARELY leave my bed. I don’t think I have felt “happy” for more than 10 minutes at any given time in the last 6 months. I applied to try to get a tattoo to cover some scars I have from when I got really bad, but they never contacted me again...so that reminder is always there making me feel sick and myself and taunting me to do it again just to numb the crap in my head. I’m trying to be a partner to this amazing guy I care a ton about, but I feel so emotionally shut down that I don’t even react to jokes or love anymore. I don’t even like when he cuddles me because his breath on my neck is a trigger... Now, I do not have it as bad as a lot of other people. I grew up in a family with a loving (OCD) grandmother, a grandfather, and a (drug addict) mother who all always made sure I had food and a place to sleep. That alone is more than a lot of people get...but every time I try to talk to someone and they don’t respond to me I flip out at them because my mom didn’t want me to interrupt her high. When something goes SLIGHTLY wrong or is a SMIDGE out of place I panic because that’s all I had around me. When someone on the street spits I flinch because my ex’s favourite way to degrade me was to spit in my face while mocking me. When I go downtown I get anxious because that’s where I was publicly beating by a (different yet no les “charming”) ex. I avoid drinking now because I don’t want to fall into drinking to feel happy again and I definitely don’t want to add to my scars...but this is all I have known my whole life. Every time I try to take a step forward, improve myself, or even leave the house to do something I once enjoyed, it feels like the weight of every circumstance and bad decision in my life is right there to push me further into the dirt. The only ways I know how to make money aren’t things I want to do...the only people in my life I want to be around I can’t stand to be near...I feel like I have nothing left to hold onto and I’m drowning!

"I am new here. I'm from Australia, I'm 27 years old next month, married with a 2.5 year - old daughter and a baby son on the way. I work in Insolvency (liquidations etc). I have been on antidepressant medication on and off for about 4 years now (initially Aropax, now Aurorix), in hindsight I have actually suffered from depression for my entire life. I'm a similar personality to my mother who also suffers from depression. My younger brother and sister seem to have drawn the long straw as such, they seem not to be affected.  Things went downhill for me about the time I started on medication. I was in the early stages of a major gambling problem, and untreated depression had led to a real strain on my marriage. We split up for 3 months (during which time I made 2 lame suicide attempts), reunited and seemed to get back on track, having our first child. Throughout this time the gambling problem intensified, and spiraled out of control to the point where I am now a bankrupt. During this time I also became extremely withdrawn to the point where I hate leaving our house and am more or less unable to cope with spending time with anyone except my wife and daughter. I also had something of a breakdown about 9 months ago, quit my job, which led to great tension between me and my wife (spending 24 / 7 together), eventually she could not cope and moved out. Shortly after we worked it out and I moved in with her.  Things seem pretty good now, we are a lot more relaxed about things and we just seem to get along better, looking forward very much to the birth of our second, in about 6 weeks time. My gambling problem is pretty much dealt with (thanks chiefly to having little money and no access to it now) but I am still depressed, withdrawn and generally tired of life. To be honest, I am only around because of my wife and daughter, I feel little reason to exist other than for them.  I am also a christian and this is very hard, because there is a real burden of ""I shouldn't feel this way, I should be happy"". This leads to more depression, and at the moment I am reluctant to go to church, I don't pray or read the bible. I'm generally resentful of anyone who I consider to have a better existence than me (which is just about everyone). So while things are quite stable at home, I personally am at my lowest point in some respects. I am quite intelligent and every employer I have ever had has commented on my abundance of potential but lack of drive. So true, I lack any kind of ambition (and harbor something of an extreme opposition to materialism and the pursuit of money and possessions) and even now am tossing up whether to continue working. I have a chief interest (i.e. motorsport), but other interests have been decimated e.g. I used to be quite a good pianist but now have absolutely no desire to play. I also can't get the motivation up to get involved in playing sport, which in the past has been a big part of my life.  So that's me in a nutshell. My extreme difficulty in taking on face to face help / relationships has driven me to get involved in some online depression forums as I think this may be a good way for me to start some kind of recovery.

"Things that I liked about today so far **Maybe the only way to escape depression is gratitude. Cicero, one of the senators of Rome in the early days of the empire is quoted to have said ""Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.""   I liked waking up early and going to the gym on an intense pre workout.  I like stepping outside in the cold to smoke and feel the warmth when I re-enter the building.  I like seeing the trees trying to survive the winter, how splendorous they are. In them I see people going through hard times and the beauty that exists within them.  I liked logging on to Runescape to escape reality for a couple of hours and talking to my friends on there. The fact that we have escapes is an amazing thing.  I liked seeing three girls meet each other outside and say ""Hiiii how are youuuu?"" and compliment each other. Instead of normally being irritated by that, I actually admired that people in reality share bonds and happiness with each other's presence, and it made me happy to see that.  I like the complexity of the mathematics that I'm doing and the fact that I'm doing it.  I like having a planned meeting with a group of people today for my class presentation in college.  I like having a picture of a God who constantly forgives and is deeply saddened by our unhappiness that becomes to hard to bear for some, versus a picture of an angry Colonel with zero mercy.  I like the fact that I have a place to resort to to write down the thoughts streaming from my mind.

"Well I'm 13 so please excuse my grammar and spelling. Well it started almost about... 1.3 yr ago. I started to get large mood swings and would end up being sad or feeling guilty nearly everyday. That's when i discovered cutting myself. It started off as what does it feel like then grew into and addiction. I used to be doing it nearly everyday. IT made/makes me feel like there's nothing wrong. Well this grew bigger and bigger and i didn't tell anyone about it. After about 8 months i started to lie to myself and say everything was fine, It worked. Only temporarily. Around 3 months ago the feelings came back and i still have them at this moment. I have researched a lot about clinical depression. I still cut and i hate it. I came right out to my parents and said ''Maybe i enjoy cutting myself"" when we were in a huge fight. My dad turned around and said ""we don't care if you cut yourself"". This definitely didn't help. So right now i have one person i can talk to about it and has a good friend of mine. I checked the symptoms of clinical depression on Answers.com and i have 12/13 of them. I need to go see a doctor i know but i just can't. There's something stopping me and i don't know what it is. I just want to solve it on my own but i can't. I need Help. I have also been thinking about committing suicide and doing drugs but my friends that know i cut are stopping me. I know i will be missed. I just can't live on anymore... I can't see myself living past 18. Can anyone relate to this?

"I don’t want to be an adult anymore. I’ve been struggling with my depression a lot lately and I really really wish I could turn to one of my parents to tell them how much I’m struggling. More importantly, I wish I could tell one of them and one of them cared.  I know I’m a decent disappointment to both of them for several reasons.  1) I haven’t had a decent job. I’ve been floating on jobs that get me less than five hours a week.   2) I don’t have friends. Granted, that’s because my mother literally and intentionally isolated me so I have no social skills at all.  3) I have big dreams but zero motivation in life so I can’t even try to achieve them.  So what I’m trying to do is work on myself.   Today I started a new (third, I now have three of these stupid things) job. I thought I did pretty good considering the store didn’t burn down and no one told me that I was a failure. But literally as soon as the sun set, I feel all my doubt and darkness telling that I’m lying to myself. That I’m being naive by thinking that I did well, that I was probably a huge burden to everyone else in the store. But I’m trying, so that has to count for something right? I went and got a third job on my own, so why don’t I feel like I should be proud of myself?  I have no friends. In fact, during 2017, I was so excited to have made a great friend and I was completely betrayed by them. The kind of betrayal where I walked away from a friendship and haven’t bothered reading the apologies they’ve sent me. I’ve tried reconnecting with friend that I had earlier in life, but I’m not doing so well. I feel like they will do something to me and then I’ll lose another friend. And logically, if I’m the only common factor in all my failed friendships, then I must be the problem, right? I must be the problem. I’m the problem. Maybe I’m not meant to have friends.   And I’ve always had big dreams for myself. But because of how I was raised, I have no accountability. Because seriously, why bother trying if everything I do is going to be met with disapproval and anger? So I’ve been trying really hard to make myself follow at least one goal. I chose to go for my art. Problem being that with my depression crashing on me in waves, I’m really struggling to stick to my goal of one art post a day. I’m trying really hard but I’m so afraid that I’ll be the failure I was taught to be.    In all of this, I just really really wish I could quit trying to be an adult and go back to the days when I believed my mom when she said she loved me, I want to go back to when my dad wanted to help me talk things out so I could figure out what I was doing. I want to be able to call my mom up and tell her that I feel like a complete failure and that I can’t add to see my therapist and that I need help talking the darkness down. But if I call her, she’ll one-up me because I’m the biggest mistake of her life. Or worse, she’ll tell me that I should try (fill in the blank with whatever bs Facebook depression fix is trending). I want to be able to call my mom and say hey, I got another job and I’m excited. I want her to tell me that she’s proud of me.   I really want to have a conversation with my dad that doesn’t involve the phrase “well get over it”. ‘Hey dad, I’m full of regret and turmoil’ ‘ugh just get over it’ well excuse me sir for being by the reality that I just pulled a mulan and cut all my hair off so that I could get another job. I went from having shoulder length hair that made me feel good about myself to hair that’s half an inch long and highlights everything about my face that gives me horrible anxiety. Maybe I’m really hurting because I went in to work yesterday and two of my managers greeted me with ‘ew gross, what happened to your hair?’ And now I feel like I’m as ugly as I think I am.  I really miss being a kid when I could pretend that my world wasn’t on fire or that I wasn’t drowning.  And I don’t know how to make any of the darkness back up so that I can breathe.  I really wish that I could see my therapist this week.

"Desperate for advice or input; I lost and am losing everything held dear to me right now due to multiple reasons, and would just like to hear some different recommendations I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DONT KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG OR HOW TO FEEL BETTER!!  I've typed this out way too many times so I'm gonna do my best to sum it up as short as I can:  Last week me and my gf of 10 and a half months broke up, i was devestated. In that little time I have experienced more love, more of life than ever before and it felt like we'd been together forever. I thought, maybe we would work things out on our own and get back together when the time was right, even though i knew it was a stretch, but i was also okay with just being friends if that was what the world had planned. 2 days after the break up im talking to both of my best friends who are also (kinda?) friends with her, and they both tell me that she basically told them she had absolutely no intention of ever getting back with me because she wanted to ho around without the commitment of a relationship. She also openly bragged to one of them that she had cheated on me multiple times during our relationship. This all made me very angry and on top of that hurt. The same night just after finding all of this out I find out from my other friend that she had called her and bragged about hooking up with this one kid who, during our entire relationship, she told me she hated and that we BOTH already had bad history with, and fooled around. Then later (AGAIN) she goes on instagram live with my bestfriend who is kinda being fake just to see how she really is and openly brags about blocking me (which added to the hurt cause i had done nothing but try to respect her wishes since the split in hopes that we could at least part on good terms ya know) , saying that i was 'fucking crazy' and that she never wanted anything to do with me ever again. There's more in terms of details but thats the basic general idea of the past week for me.  I dont know how i feel or what to say. I feel hurt and i feel abandoned and i feel stupid and i feel not good enough and i feel like a complete fuck up i feel so fucking awful its not even funny. Im losing my friends because my stupid brain cant get over this and im constantly going to them to talk about it because that's the way i like to deal with stuff, but they've heard the same thing one too many times and i get that i just dont know what else to do. Im tired of thinking about it, im tired of not being able to confront her but my friends say its not a good idea because its not gonna do anything but make her think even higher of herself for having fucked me up so badly and wont at all make her change her ways. I want to completely forget but at the same time a part of me wants to work everything out just so i can mean something to this person who meant absolutely everything to me at one point again, WHY??  Why does my brain, or heart, or whatever still crave attention from her, or maybe even her herself, even after knowing all of this? Why am i so fucking pathetic? What can I do to move on that doesn't involve just ignoring the problem and moving forward but rather coming to peace with it and myself and blossoming?  Please, all and every opinion or suggestion is welcome. Thank you if you took the time to read this and I wish everybody the best of luck with your own problems no matter what they be.

"My latest depression has a cure, and it's my girlfriend. So this is my story about a severe depression and anxiety I have been experiencing these months.  TLDR, we kinda broke up back in April, we had some issues regarding me being a prick. But, she forgave me as we have a perfect relationship (that's right, I do think it's marvelous). But for some important reason that I don't wanna give details in, we can't be together anymore. So, I started having anxiety attacks, and all my world was like hell, it was so bad, I felt like I had to do something about it. Anyways, I am fighting to be back again with her, and she also is waiting for me. We all dream about things or situations where we would allegedly be happy with: money, being successful.. all that kind of stuff.  Here's what I have learned: When I dream about all this stuff, at the end the only thing, I mean, my only desire, the only thing that I crave in this world, and which I would be crushed to not have, is her. I'm a person who deeply depends on others, I previously gave myself into deep friendships, but after all, and after all experience, my only friendship and relationship I'm keeping with is my girlfriend. She literally is my everything regarding my happiness, and me being alive.   Here's the summary: I wanna go back with my girlfriend, and I am depressed and sad if I'm not with her. I know we'll be hopefully soon together, but as the meantime, I feel like my days are worthless and my life is meaningless.

"My boring sob story Family members told me all the time that being an adult is shit and I should make the most of being a kid. So when depression hit me I thought it was normal, but it didn’t feel “right.” I wasn’t upset all the time, it was just like a flat misery sort of feeling.  Things started to feel odd for me, certain sounds and smells and silly things like the wind of my face felt wrong. Like they’d be toned down somehow. Eventually I became completely disconnected from my emotions, save for the occasional moment when I actually find something funny. I’ve been on two types of medication and had therapy too, neither of which did anything for me.   I didn’t notice myself become so gradually withdrawn from everything. Now going to the shop or getting the bus is something I’d rather not do. Things I’d do every day. My social life went backwards as well as my social skills. Now I’m afraid to talk to people. I literally reject girls I’m interested in on the spot, before I even have chance to fuck it up myself. Things that I would do without thinking now take encouragement and energy.   Then came the cynicism. Belief that nobody out there was pure and everything they did was for their own personal gain. Suppose it’s true in a sense but I wish I didn’t have this “paint everybody with the same brush” mindset. It’s hard to believe I’m the same person at times. It’s been 7 years now and I’ve had enough. Just dunno what to do. I feel like I’ve tried everything. Can’t help but feel I’m partly responsible, for buying into the shit I told myself.

"Alright, I've been here before, to this site and this depressed on life.  I have experience that would get any person out of depression and live a pretty well rounded life.  Only to be honest I sometimes choose i think to be down and out all the time.  I was in recovery from a drug problem for 2 years and i developed a relationship with a Higher Power that really really helped with my depression / anxieties / addictions.  So it would be insane for someone who knows the solution to not use it right?  Well i've heard it said before, that once someone who had great faith loses it it makes it  more difficult for that person to find hope or faith, so that's where i've been the past 2 1/2 months, hopeless.      I tried Heroin after 2 years clean.  Looking for something to shut my mind up and find some comfortable peace due to my increasing loneliness and depression.  I only got real sick for about the two weeks i was on it and lost a job and apartment.  Then i moved back with my mom who has deep anger at my dad and life i guess who is with a man that is using her in my opinion, he's in a halfway house and just lays on her couch all day.   And my dad has deep depression / bipolar on every medication you could think of and lives with his mom who only talks about ""the divorce"" and how ""i should have did this different"" So really if i look at it long enough and deep enough they're alive but dead in a healthy emotional, spiritual, mental level, so where's the encouragement or love i so long needed as a younger person, and even most importantly i need some guidance now, instead of being ashamed of who they are.  I just need to vent.  I'm 22 i just started college last week and i am extremely anxious when there, I feel as though i wear a suit, outfit, costume of misery, fear, depression, THE VOID.  So it drives others away, plus i am ashamed of being a depressive / anxious dude so keeping others away is my aim.  I mean i'm 22 i should be getting laid and having fun right?!  Man i feel so old but so immature emotionally.  I talked to a friend of mine that is at Yale in Connecticut last night who has always been a good natured, smart, artistic guy, and a person who experiences depression but doesn't let it get the best of him, and he said to not dwell in the negative like i've always done, find something through out the day that is positive, a girl smiles at you, a song whatever.

"I really need some advice *trigger warning* *trigger warning*  Hi everyone. I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong. This is my first time visiting this subreddit, and so I don't know what's generally expected or done on here. Let me just get into this.   I'm 22 and I've never experienced depression. I'm a Psychology major and I've taken classes over the topic, but I know reading about it can only give me so much insight. The reason I'm posting on here is because I have a 12 year old cousin who tried cutting herself the other day. She's depressed, says she wants to die, and I am so, so worried about her. She lives a few hours from me and is being watched closely right now, but I plan on going out to visit her this weekend.   To be honest, she has a horrible living situation. My aunt (her mom) is awful. To my aunt, every problem can be solved by God, she's financially fucked and letting it out on my cousins, and she's extremely dismissive of my cousins feelings, needs, and emotions. It also doesn't help that my cousin is adopted, and I know she just feels detached from her own family.   Anyways, I know that there's no such thing as simply getting your advice on how to fix my cousins depression. I know how complex of an issue this is. What I want to know from you all is if there is anything I can do this weekend to just show her that things can get better. My little cousin has always looked up to me, and I plan on taking her out to do some of the things that she always wants to do (like go to the park, make slime, whatever 12 year olds like).

"It feels as if I'm heading towards a dark place Hey, haven't been here before but I had a quick scroll and this feels like the right sub to vent to. I'm 18 from the UK, I've had a rough educational life (I alway talked, went in high with my friends, got in minor trouble that kinda thing). I fucked up college in the second year of my 2 year diploma course and got excluded for the same kind of shit previously mentioned but on a larger scale, this really fucked me up as I thought I'd end up doing nothing with my life when I really wanted to do something with it. 10 weeks ago I got a job and a paid for graduates course which pays out over £1100 per month after tax which is incredible for me, it's a job I love, work hard at and it's exactly the path I want to take in life career-wise. So I've been given a second start, I have money, great friends, a good social life and my life is on track but I still can't quite feel complete. I'm very social anxious and this affects my everyday life but I push through it, I have to. I smoke week almost everyday and I've been smoking for about 5 years now. The problem is, I still have a void that I can't fill and I can never really feel that happy by myself. I love my metal and I'm a huge music fan, I used to play a lot of games but I've stopped caring so much now. Sometimes I find it hard to enjoy things as much as I used to. I feel exhausted at home as I don't sleep much and the anxiety takes it out of me until I walk through the door. It feels as if it's getting worse and I don't know what to do and I don't even know why I feel this way. Sometimes it can get quite bad where I won't even feel like doing anything but pulling bongs with the TV on in the background as the day is just too much to handle sometimes.   Sry for the huge wall of text but I'm trying to get this typed quick as I'm about to go out. I don't even know why I'm posting this really, I want to vent, maybe I want advise.

"I'm a hetero man, 35, divorced, no kids. I can honestly say that I feel empathy towards any guy who suffers from depression. Some of my closest guy friends have admitted to me their many bouts of battling these demons, just as I've shared my horror stories and near suicidal incidents, and we all have empathy with each other over that stuff. I'm beginning to not give a crap anymore about depression being viewed as just a ""woman"" issue; it is what it is and to heck with gender stereotypes. The things I've noticed the most are my friends' unwillingness to consult a therapist or take medication, but perhaps their bouts of depression are not the ""bed-ridden"" variety that I have gone through. Or maybe this is their way of not feeling ""completely weak"". Most of my friends will either drink excessively or take drugs to deal with this stuff. I tried to drink it all away, but in the end it just made me feel worse. I tried tranquilizers, but that didn't work. I tried booze and pills together, but still the depression lingered.

"The Irony of Loneliness in an Overpopulated World As I spend more time in the presence of depression, I've tried to apply a further focus to understand what's actually going on in my head. Dealing with the sudden appearance of depression has been a nightmare and a half to deal with to say the least. So in response, I regularly attempt to interpret the spiral of self loathing thoughts and whirlwind of emotions that march throughout my mind.   My initial reaction to a diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempts has been to run away from everything that reeks of painful memories, both theoretically and literally:  * I write this post 7,000 kilometres from my home country, in Japan, where I aim to live for the next couple of years.  * ‎I've ghosted those whom I use to call my close friends. * I left all social media in order to avoid contacting people that I knew, and because looking at how happy other people were brought me down.  * ‎I changed my image drastically over the past year as an outward expression of the fact that I'm trying to change as a person.  It's here in Japan that I've come to a terrifying realisation. I can't run from depression. Here I am, in a country where people speak a totally different language and immersed in a totally different culture to my own, writing a post about depression.   Recently, I was walking the streets in search for job opportunities when I sunk into a depressed mood and began thinking about my place in the world (which always turns out well). Nothing actually matters. We work in order to pay rent, in order to stay in the same place, so that we can reliably keep a job so that we can pay rent. It's in this meaninglessness that humans as social beings look to others for comfort. Our lives are but a meaningless speck in an expanding universe. That's quite the depressing thought... And it is. But why is it that when another body's lying on top of mine, or when I'm held in a warm embrace, this thought doesn't have any impact on me?  I've done quite a bit of thinking by myself,  and have talked to a bunch of people from back in the psychiatric ward on what 'fixes' us. And the unfortunate answer for most of us is... Nothing. We can't be fixed. It's just how our minds work. But what if we don't have to be fixed? The hardest part about depression for me, is the intensity of the loneliness I feel. When I'm at my worst, I'm so focused on my own loneliness and the meaninglessness of my relationships, that the few connections I do have, I dismiss. Now, this isn't the case for all people suffering from depression. For a lot of people, their negative emotions are driven by a sense of worthlessness,  meaninglessness or sadness.   But the general consensus is, although we can't 'fix' ourselves, we can have people around us to support us when we're at our lowest. And it makes sense that as social beings, human intimacy provides us with a safety net for when depression's hitting us the hardest.   Unfortunately for most of us, the type of physical and emotional intimacy that we strive for is unobtainable. In my life, depression's caused me to push away the people that I've spent time building connections with, and has limited the amount of contact I've had with strangers and people that I COULD connect with.  I think it's ironic. It's ironic that in such an overpopulated world, depression is such a big issue. We're the people that need intimacy the most, so you'd think we'd be in a position where intimacy is more readily available. But that's not how the world works. Our lives are still meaningless. We still hate ourselves. And we're still alone.

"Why depression is, and isn't like a skinned knee: Some thoughts I had that I wanted to share I was just pondering depression, and I decided to jot down what I was thinking. It's sort of a good way to put words to what it feels like to suffer from depression.  ____________________________________  Why it IS like a skinned knee:   Depression usually comes in episodes for me, and a lot of people I've talked to. Sometimes I'll be doing okay, and then have a really bad day, or even a bad week.   These episodes are sort of like skinning your knee. When you were little, skinning your knee feels like the absolute worst thing in the world. You think, ""OW, THIS HURTS SO MUCH! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?!""   You feel so helpless.   When you're an adult and skin your knee, you know what to do. You know that you're supposed to clean it, and put a bandage on it. And that's exactly what you do; you don't make a fuss.   But, even though you clean it and bandage it, it's of course still going to hurt. It's a cut. You just ignore the pain, though, because you've already taken care of it, and there's not much else you can do beyond that. You just have to live with the fact that it's going to hurt for a while.   Depression is the exact same way. When it happens, you know what you should do to handle it. The best way, backed by science and research, is what we've all heard countless times: Exercise, eat healthy, do something nice for yourself, clean your living space, listen to happy music, watch TV shows that make you happy, etc.   So you know to do this stuff. But of course, it's not going to magically feel 100% better right off the bat. There's still that emotional pain there, just like the way a skinned knee stings. But you've already done everything you can to take care of it, so you have to live with it and wait patiently for the pain to go away.   ______________________________________________   Why depression ISN'T like a skinned knee:   Most people know that depression has a way of demotivating sufferers. Things you once enjoyed no longer interest you. Nothing seems like it has a point.   But this also affects your drive to treat your depression. When you skin your knee, you just take care of it right away, you don't give any second thought to it. It's just what you do. With depression, you know that you should be exercising, eating healthy, listening to happy music, cleaning, etc. But you don't. What's the point?    The difference is, that depression makes you NOT want to get better, or more accurately, not care about getting better. Sometimes, you're just apathetic and nihilistic, ""What's the point? I don't care. Getting better is too much effort."" Sometimes, you just want to wallow in your own despair. For me, when I feel this way, it's because I feel worthless and self-loathing. I think, ""I deserve to feel this way. I deserve this emotional pain that I'm going through. I don't deserve to feel better, or to be happy.""   That's the vicious cycle that depression uses to keep you down.   If you are reading this and have depression, I hope this helps you understand your own illness a little more clearly. If you're reading this and you don't have depression, I hope this gives you a good account of what it's like, so you can empathize with people who have depression.   Stay safe, everyone.

"Anyone ever look back at their younger years and wonder how they used to be such a joyful person? I saw a post on here about someone remembering a feeling of emptiness since they were five and just not knowing it was depression.  For me it's the opposite.  I was always a super joyful kid, and maybe a little too hyper.  (I was that annoying kid when I was 10-11).  Then around seventh grade I started to withdrawal from the world slightly, and just talked a little less than average.  This seemed all fine at the time, it made me a more likable person.  But I think that was the beginning.  I finally realized my lack of a friend group because of how I acted when I was younger during third quarter that year.  It wasn't bad depression, but it only got worse from there.  My Dad turned from mean to abusive starting next year, and my mom started to be disappointed with everything I do.  My parents don't even know anything about me besides a few keywords because they haven't held a conversation with me since I was 11.  The only person who I can say genuinely cares for me is my best friend, and he doesn't even know I am depressed.  I don't see a reason why I am, so why should I explain that to someone who is much more depressed than I am?  By the time I turned 14 I can say I was depressed.

"Call me Mrs. Self-Destruction Everything I do is wrong. I was given every advantage in life: intelligence, compassion, athleticism, even looks. I have spent the last 11 years (since 15) sabotaging my own success. I'm now  in full self-destruct mode.   No anti-depressant works for me. Every medication makes me miserable and sick unless it is a stimulant, and I don't want to be stuck on stimulants. I used to drink as a crutch and now I can't.   My husband and I were separated and moved back in together. He is an addict too and going through withdrawal, so he is extra-sensitive. My ex decided that it would be a great time to blackmail me with Facebook statuses and tag my husband in them.

It just makes things worse.    I have no motivation at work. Therapy is not working and I need a new therapist, but I don't have the energy or self-love to care enough to do anything about my issues.

"Hi all, I'm new to this forum and am in desperate need for help and advice as I've nowhere else to turn. I'll start at the beginning. I feel that I'm under a lot of stress with my job and the pressures of life. I feel that stress and depression go hand in hand. I'm not sure if I am stressed and depressed or if I have something medically wrong with me. That's where I need advice on what are common symptoms of depression and stress. At first I thought I was anemic as I am pale and don't eat a lot of meat so thought that my dizziness was down to lack of iron in the system. I also get eye strain but put that down to working on computers as a living. I have had blood tests for anemia, diabetes, blood sugar levels and other general tests which all came back fine. I have changed my diet and exercise more. At the moment I suffer from dizziness, eye strain, headaches, lack of concentration, irritability, lethargic and lack of co-ordination. If I'm honest I'm s***ting (Not sure if I can say that) myself as I don't understand what is wrong with me. I have a loving girlfriend and no money problems and a good social life but a stressful (if that's a word) job.

"isnt it kind of crazy when people who actually are not clinically depressed say they want to die or are depressed for fun, when you are really dealing with those feelings for real? There are people at my work place who clearly are not clinically depressed but tag and share memes like they are lonely or depressed or just say they want to die in a funny way, when everyday is a huge challenge for me in terms of forcing myself to be alive and conform to the societal norms.

"Falling for someone you have no chance to be with Warning: Super long read  Have you ever fallen for someone that you know you have absolutely no chance with?  It’s been 4 years since I’ve fallen for a girl back in college, which ended up in heartbreak and depression because she already found someone else. I’ve lost all motivations and my passion for arts (I’m an art student), failed my thesis which sent me into another dark place, ’friends’ were not even there to help me get up, and for the remaining years I had in college, the thing that kept me going are my parents, I just wanted to survive for them. I’ve lost all emotions, the flame that was once burning in my heart, the excitement I had when I was a freshman. I graduated college 7 months ago and found work not related to the course I took up, it felt really low, but I just wanted to survive. Training for work now, didn’t want to make friends again, had one, but he didn’t liked the people so he left in a few weeks, the only thing in my mind was to focus and be better for this job to survive. Avoided lunch and hanging out with workmates, and didn’t really reveal much about myself aside from having a mundane life. The trainers were aware of my introversion and decided to have random sitting arrangements every week so we could get to know our workmates more, and I could get to talk about other stuff aside from work. 3 weeks in training and still, I didn’t made any connections, I only help out my workmates professionally, point out mistakes and the next step they should take.  I get to be sit mates with the liveliest girl in training, playful and have a contagious ’happy’ aura(?). There were also a few talks and laughs about work related stuff, but I didn’t really made efforts to start it, she was always the one that engages first (and that’s because she’s an extrovert and does this to everyone anyways). Being around her, hearing her voice, seeing her smile felt something, it felt like the flame that I lost 4 years ago came back. But, what made me fell the most is that she’s intelligent as well and speaks in English flawlessly (I live in a country outside US). I can also relate to her because she suffers from clinical depression and requires therapy sessions every now and then (everyone in training knows this anyways because she told the class from the get-go). I didn’t really asked her out for lunch or coffee, I really wanted to so I could get to know her better and be friends with her, be her guide in her darkest days, but my introversion and over thinking always gets the best of me.  There were only a few times she joined me and my friend during a coffee break where I found out a few things about her. There were times that I see the sadness beyond her smile, and times where her depression was clearly visible and affected me greatly. I always think about scenarios - if the conditions were right - where I get to talk with her and lend a helping hand, at the end of the day they only remain as thoughts. I know she doesn’t think about me like how I think about her. Every time our shift ends, I leave the office quickly and ignore the feelings I have for her, my mind is at a constant battle on whether or not to ask her for lunch, ask her if she’s ok. It’s even worse at night, whenever I see her late night tweets about her depression, a part of me just wants to be there for her, and the other part gives me the realization of how pathetic I am and that I don’t deserve her. I know that she had an ex-bf that broke her heart, and currently has a gf (she’s bi). Yet, she still gives me inspiration in every photo I take. I really don’t know what is wrong with me, I’m being tormented by my own mind and I still like it. Knowing that she already has someone in her heart, yet still seeing her depressed at times (and looking at her tweets), really makes me want to step up and do something, but held back by my own tormented soul.  Next week would be the last week in training, after that we’re going to get split up into teams and do actual work, but still go back to class to share our experience and reflect upon them. One could only hope for a miracle that I gain the strength and courage to talk to her more and be a part of her life. I really hate this feeling, yet this pain fuels my passion even more.",falling chance warning super long read fallen know absolutely chance with year fallen girl college ended heartbreak depression else lost motivation passion art i art student failed thesis sent dark place friend not help up remaining year college thing kept going parent just wanted survive them lost emotion flame burning heart excitement freshman graduated college month ago work not related course took up felt really low just wanted survive training work now did not want make friend again one did not liked people left week thing mind focus better job survive avoided lunch hanging workmate did not really reveal aside having mundane life trainer aware introversion decided random sitting arrangement week know workmate more talk stuff aside work week training still did not connection help workmate professionally point mistake step take sit mate liveliest girl training playful contagious happy aura talk laugh work related stuff did not really effort start it engages and extrovert doe anyways her hearing voice seeing smile felt something felt like flame lost year ago came back but fell intelligent speaks english flawlessly i live country outside u relate suffers clinical depression requires therapy session everyone training know anyways told class getgo did not really asked lunch coffee really wanted know better friend her guide darkest day introversion thinking get best me time joined friend coffee break thing her time sadness smile time depression clearly visible affected greatly think scenario condition right talk lend helping hand end day remain thought know doe not think like think her time shift end leave office quickly ignore feeling her mind constant battle not ask lunch ask ok worse night late night tweet depression just want her give realization pathetic not deserve her know exbf broke heart currently gf she bi yet give inspiration photo take really not know wrong me tormented mind like it knowing heart seeing depressed time and looking tweet really make want step something held tormented soul week week training going split team actual work class share experience reflect them hope miracle gain strength courage talk life really hate feeling pain fuel passion more,0.46372273564338684,0.4917774796485901,0.45393460988998413

When I’m with them, I just find myself wishing I could be alone.  I know the problem is with me, and that I’m sabotaging my relationships (as I always do and have done for many years). I feel guilty about it, especially knowing that I’m lucky to even have friends. But the truth is, I find people exhausting, and whenever I’m with them I just feel lonelier that when I’m alone.

"What to do with my life. I just turned 21 in June and I’m really understanding that life is moving at a very fast pace. I was never good in school only because I hated it and never realized how bad it would effect my future the way it is now. I moved away for college at 19 for a whole year and only passed a few classes because I didn’t care that much. I came home and decided to take the year off.

"Sick of rejection Met someone on an app we seemed to click and talked all night till like 4am, same the next night and the night after that etc. Honestly for the first time in ages I thought Id done it and found someone who liked me aswell and we could hang out and have some fun, even just over the summer Id have been happy with that.   After more talking we met, we drove round and spent a few hours just chilling and talking it was fun but something wasnt right. I have these little games I play to kind of 'test the waters', nothing creepy just some fun light flirting like a play full punch to the arm or lean myself a bit closer in watching a video or something, harmless stuff but the reactions tell you the story. Long story short it wasnt the story I was hoping for, nothing was reciprocated and there was just no positive body language (I know im sounding like some sort of socially awkward overly analytical weirdo here but trust me its just the best way I can describe it over text).  So it gets to nearly 11 he starts yawning talking about being up for work, fair enough weve been out 4 hours so I drop him home, says text me when you get back so I do and sure enough the generic one word 'haha' responses start and that was it.  The thing is its not the first time, it happens all the time, I rarely find anyone who actually has proper chat with me (always just 'fuck now dude?' or that type of crap) so I start getting feelings and they seem to like me, we meet and it all seems to fall apart aftwerwards. Your just gonna have to trust me that im not creepy, I dont make sexual advances, I can hold convo, make people laugh, everyone always seems happy to spend a good few hours with me and not want to go home yet when they do it all comes crashing down.

"So I finally realized something this week... Been stuck in an episode since my birthday (just turned 25, as per my last post). Can't remember the last time I ate a proper meal. Sleep cycle is fucked. Haven't left the house in a week. Funny enough, I had planned on hanging out and doing some reading in a cafe today... only to never leave the house. All this time, I've been thinking how much I yearn to have someone, anyone, physically check in. Or a partner to cuddle with, hug, and hold me tight.... but all that just fades into the empty void.   I used to be Christian, and used to pray. Now that I'm not, I'm realizing how truly alone I am in dealing with all this. My friends all live in the city center. They have jobs and livelihoods. Ultimately, I have to physically do things by myself. No one's gonna save me. It's heartbreaking. Physically, I'm just so alone.",finally realized week stuck episode birthday just turned post ca not remember time ate proper meal sleep cycle fucked not left house week funny enough planned hanging doing reading cafe today leave house time thinking yearn someone anyone physically check in partner cuddle with hug hold tight just fade void used christian used pray not realizing truly dealing this friend live city center job livelihood ultimately physically thing myself gonna save me heartbreaking physically just alone,0.5901405215263367,0.4803706109523773,0.5050274133682251
"I'm in a reflective mood today. I received a phone call this afternoon from the sister of my old neighbor, who I will call Alice. She had passed away this morning. Alice had been fighting terminal colon cancer since March and after harsh chemo therapy and a bout with pneumonia that landed her in the ICU, she decided that enough was enough. She stopped treatment just around the July 4th weekend. I'm not too exact on the details, but suffice it to say that she failed quickly after that and passed away in her sleep this morning surrounded by family and friends. She was only 52. As I struggle with Depression, AD/HD, tic disorders, sleep apnea, insomnia, food allergies, pollen allergies, and a weak immunity system I sometimes feel that life is unfair. I used to say that the Universe was out to get me, that God's having his little joke with me. I suppose it's only natural to feel that way. It's a full plate and I'm not too hungry for what's on the menu. Then I encounter other people with other hardships and I see that life itself is not fair to an awful lot of people. Life is, in fact, a lousy chef. What struck me as sad today, however, was not simply the passing of somebody I knew. Instead I was struck with my own mortality and weakness. Let me explain. Alice and some other neighbors hadn't been too kind to me when I moved into the area. They had accused me of various deviant behaviors that to this day still anger me. These were supposed to be my Christian brothers and sisters and instead they wielded stones. The rumors mounted as the months progressed, wilder and wilder, until they reached a crescendo where they became so outlandish that it was easy to disprove them. When all the furor amounted to nothing a lot of people were left with egg on their face. That summer several of the families involved moved away. I have unresolved issues with them, but with Alice, my neighbor, I was able to find forgiveness in my heart. The story didn't end happily there with us arm in arm, though. Alice never really apologized to me, though her behavior towards my family and myself became kinder. Unfortunately, she was one of the people I knew who didn't believe in AD/HD. One day she told me her opinion on the subject right to my face after I mentioned I had it. I was so stunned by her bold opinion that I stood there slack jawed. I swore that day I would never let that happen to me again. You see a bit of that fire in this blog whenever anybody accuses me of not having a ""real"" problem. I am as fierce in person as well. Thanks to Alice. And now she's passed on. Suddenly my anger feels petty and shallow. She moved away and now has died, but I allowed her to change me. I nursed a wound like an angry coal in my heart. I forgave her for one thing, but held a grudge for another. She became representative of all the doubters in my life and I used that as impetus for change. What type of person does that make me? On top of that, I have set lofty goals for myself that are proving hard to meet. Time is ticking and my 40th birthday is but a scant five months away. One of the byproducts of meeting those goals was to have a book with my name on it that I could bring into her elementary school classroom one day, slam on her desk, and say ""Ha!"" - as if my success would mean anything to her. As if that would prove my struggle with AD/HD was real. How silly. How foolish. Alice was only thirteen years older than I. I can blink and be 52 tomorrow. Mortality laughs at me and replaces all of life's menu items with sour grapes and rotten eggs. What shall I order now? Usually, my sense of humor keeps my spirits alight. Today, however, I see myself as being revealed as a small-minded man with insignificant goals. That even for a moment, no matter how miniscule, I was sad she died before my goals were met... This both sickens me and splashes me in the face with a brisk dose of reality. December looms and I read news? Time leaks through my fingers and I'm worried about a drop in comments on my blog? How did I get so turned around? Where did I get so terribly sidetracked? I need to remember what it is I want out of life. It is not to show up the doubters but to find joy in my own accomplishments. I know that, but negative thought attaches itself to our most noble intentions like a parasite. Allow it to stay too long and it consumes and replaces what was once good and uplifting. I don't resent Alice. I never wished her ill. But I regret I let myself hold a grudge, however slight it seemed. Life is too short for such things. So I will allow Alice to change me again. That way when I order from the menu of life it will not be just desserts.",reflective mood today received phone afternoon sister old neighbor alice passed away morning alice fighting terminal colon cancer march harsh chemo therapy bout pneumonia landed icu decided enough stopped treatment just july th weekend not exact detail suffice say failed quickly passed away sleep morning surrounded family friend struggle depression adhd tic disorder sleep apnea insomnia food allergy pollen allergy weak immunity feel life unfair used say universe me god having little joke me suppose natural feel way plate not hungry menu encounter people hardship life not fair awful lot people life is fact lousy chef struck sad today however not simply passing somebody knew instead struck mortality weakness let explain alice neighbor not kind moved area accused various deviant behavior day anger me supposed christian brother sister instead wielded stone rumor mounted month progressed wilder wilder reached crescendo outlandish easy disprove them furor amounted lot people left egg face summer family involved moved away unresolved issue them alice neighbor able forgiveness heart story did not end happily arm arm though alice really apologized me behavior family kinder unfortunately people knew did not believe adhd day told opinion subject right face mentioned it stunned bold opinion stood slack jawed swore day let happen again bit blog anybody accuses not having real problem fierce person well thanks alice passed on suddenly anger feel petty shallow moved away died allowed change me nursed wound like angry coal heart forgave thing held grudge another representative doubter life used impetus change type person doe make me that set lofty goal proving hard meet time ticking th birthday scant month away byproduct meeting goal book bring elementary school classroom day slam desk say ha success mean her prove struggle adhd real silly foolish alice thirteen year older i blink tomorrow mortality laugh replaces life menu item sour grape rotten egg shall order now usually sense humor keep spirit alight today however revealed smallminded man insignificant goal moment matter miniscule sad died goal met sickens splash face brisk dose reality december loom read news time leak finger worried drop comment blog did turned around did terribly sidetracked need remember want life not doubter joy accomplishment know that negative thought attache noble intention like parasite allow stay long consumes replaces good uplifting not resent alice wished ill regret let hold grudge slight seemed life short thing allow alice change again way order menu life not just dessert,0.5224035978317261,0.38422253727912903,0.5490450263023376
"Opened up to a ""friend"" about my depression. It could've gone better. Hello, Reddit.  I've never posted here before. I'm a bit nervous about sharing this story (I'm very shy, even anonymously), so I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read it. I'm hoping that just getting it off my chest will help, even if only a little. Also, I'm sorry if this post rambles on a bit or is incoherent at all, I'm not in the best state of mind at the moment.  Earlier today, during our school's lunch break, I opened up to somebody I trusted about my depression and anxiety. I've been on a steep downward spiral recently, and this person had taken notice that something was wrong. She sat me down, grabbed us a couple of sodas, and told me to spill my guts. Normally, I would have simply told her that everything was fine, and made some lame excuse like ""I didn't sleep well last night"" or ""I'm just worried about my exam scores"". But this was the first time that anybody had ever reached out to try and help, so I decided to be truthful. I thanked her for offering to listen, and explained that I had never shared this with anybody else, so I might struggle to fully express myself. She was understanding, and told me to take as much time as I needed.   I was very careful not to unload everything on her, I basically told her exactly what I said at the start of this post: that I struggle with depression and anxiety, and that it's been getting a lot worse recently. Initially, it seemed like it was going well. She had several follow-up questions, some of which I wasn't entirely comfortable answering. However, for the first time in years I felt a genuine sense of hope, and felt like someone actually cared about me, so I answered them anyway. Eventually, she asked me what was causing all of this. I explained that while there are certainly things that contribute to my depression on a day-to-day basis, at the root of it, there isn't really a reason. It's just who I am, almost as if it's hardwired into my brain. It's hard to explain. Do any of you understand what I'm talking about?  Anyway, this is where things took a turn. While I was trying to explain that, she stopped me and said: ""I'm sorry, I can't do this. I offered to help cause I thought you were just having girl problems, or school problems, or something. I didn't realize you were totally emo. We're not in high school anymore. Besides, you're a guy, just toughen up"". That last part stung. I knew that was a common sentiment in our society, but to hear it coming from her, someone I've been friends with since high school, really took me by surprise. I didn't know what to say, so I didn't say anything. I just kind of looked down at my lap. We sat quietly for a moment, until she got up and started gathering her things. As she started to walk away I said: ""I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I wasn't trying to do that."" She looked back at me and said: ""Look, a big reason I'm friends with you is because of your positive attitude. It's infectious, and I love that about you. But if that's really just a mask, then you should probably just keep the mask on if we're going to continue being friends."", and then she left.   She texted me a few hours later and said: ""I hope you're able to move past your issues so our friendship can move forward"". I haven't responded, and don't plan to. I cry myself to sleep at night enough as it is without also worrying about maintaining a fake personality for her. I probably won't be opening up to anyone like that again anytime soon (except, of course, to all of you wonderful people on the internet). Deep down, I know that most of the people in my life wouldn't react the way she did. But I just don't think I can build up the motivation to try it, not when I struggle just to get up in the morning.  I want to thank you all again. Not just for reading my story, but for being a part of this community. Depression and anxiety really suck, and nobody should have to suffer through them alone.  ...I'm gonna go hug my pillow now.

"Whenever I try to change my life these thoughts pop up Had depression and anxiety for years and have many times tried to make changes to my life. But I can't shake the thought that says: ""why bother?"". ""Why suffer through all that extra pain that change requires just for a long shot chance of a normal life?"".  And on top of that I don't even know if I want a normal life! I Often think that the only thing that separates myself from the ""normal people"" (in lack of a better word,) is that the ""normal people"" have an easier time fooling themselves, a bigger capacity for self-delucions.

"When people say dont quit SSRIs, listen to them I was put on 20mg Lexapro through my university's health center, but summer rolled around and since I wasnt taking a physical class (online ones dont qualify you for student insurance apparently) I had to pay ~$400 for coverage in the summer in addition to actually paying for my prescriptions. I thought I was in a good enough place (not financially though, obviously) that I didnt even need Lexapro anymore so I started using my remaining bottle and taking smaller doses every day. I went from about 20mg to 5mg a day for a week or two and then I ran out. Fast forward to today (several weeks without) and I feel like i'm having a mental breakdown over every single thing, i'm a 22 year old man and have broken down crying multiple times in the past 2 weeks and have been getting increasingly angry and even violent in some cases. I was kept waiting too long in a lobby at my apartment for mail and I ended up telling the employees to go fuck themselves and ended up throwing a chair.

Ive been in a dark place for a long time but im the kind of person who channels this into humor so not even my family could tell.

I used to be super carefree and relaxed, i was full of energy and would answer any call to chill in seconds. I just asked my close friend when was the last time he remembers the real me and he said it was the beginning of college and im currently finishing my second year. Its been getting progressively worse in the last 6 months with a serious drop in my appetite.  I also started feeling anxiety for the first time in my life and suicidal thoughts are uncommon Ive lost about 10 pounds in 2 months because of this. My grades also took a hard hit, going from a 3.0 gpa every semester to a 1.7. I just had a talk with my mom and she told me that im being ungrateful and that i need to get my shit together (ironic considering she suffered depression for years until i pushed her to divorce my father).  Im not blaming her at all for my situation because she was raised by two hardasses so i understand why its hard for her to understand why a teen would be depressed. I know that life is worth it and it gets better but i really cant keep the darkness out of my head.

"Why is it so hard to just be empathetic? Today, I failed miserably at baking a key lime pie. Filling was way too loose, meringue wouldn't whip, crust cracked, just a terrible time overall. And then my mom comes over and instead of comforting me or something a normal human being would do, says ""Better luck next time,"" with the tone of a carny trying to get a six year old away from his ring toss booth. I got even more upset, and that seemed to genuinely confuse her.  All I wanted in that moment was for her to say ""I'm sorry your pie didn't turn out, it'll be okay."" Or just something a human being with emotions would say to their upset daughter.  This even just kind of exemplified what I get sick of in people. Even if you don't ""get it"" why is it so hard to realize that people have different priorities from you? Especially people who are depressed or have other mental illnesses.

"How to break up with my depressed/suicidal girlfriend? I’m in a tough position... I fell for a girl over 6 months ago and we’ve been dating since. It’s faded for me at least, and I don’t feel the same way I did at all, but from what she’s told me her feelings for me have only gotten stronger and we’ve already hit the “I love you” stage. I still care for her as a person and there’s nothing bad between us nor do we argue, but it’s just not what it was and I feel like I’ve needed to move on for the past 2-3 months. My issue with this is the fact that she’s both depressed and has been suicidal in the past (not things I knew off the bat, but learned towards the beginning). She has 1 real friend and a sibling she’s close to, but aside from that she doesn’t get along with her family. She’s told me before I’m really all she has, but not in a desperate way (although I think it is that too). I don’t really know how to tell her or what to be cautious of because this is the first time I’ve dated someone like this. I know it’s a shitty situation but I need to move on in a way that leaves her the least impacted or in the best way I can.

"Doctor taking me off meds Cold Turkey Hi everyone, I've been on Prozac (Fluexetine) since 9th grade. I am a 2nd year student in college now. For the past few years I've been upped from 10mg, to 20mg, and now 40mg. I've been on 40 mg for 3 years. When I went to my doctor it was only to tell him during a check up that I was comfortable with my medicine and dosage, so he would send more prescriptions to my pharmacy.   During my last visit, I expected it to be a quick and simple check up as usual, but instead he said he was prescribing me ""3 more months"" of  40 mg Prozac then making me stop cold Turkey because ""being on Prozac for more than 6 months is bad"".   I don't understand because he has been constantly renewing my prescription for years and never said anything about tapering off or stopping. I once went a month cold turkey during a health insurance issue and around the 3rd week I had attempted suicide.   And addressing the ""3 months"" he promised, I was quickly informed the pharmacy was only given 1 month of medicine for me   I've been admitted to a mental hospital by my mother after I got raped and beaten, because I drank a lot of alcohol for a few days.  I've been to several therapists. I've been rationing my pills 1 every 2 days, and my mother and fiancée who I live with have already seen a drastic change in my behavior. I feel awful because they give me such a nice and comfortable life but I am still depressed. I don't know what to do when I have no more antidepressants after 5+ years and then going cold Turkey.

"Ok, so i've had depression for at least 4 years and it has gotten a lot worse the past two. My mom tried shoving prozac down my throat and swore that it helped me, but it didn't.

I do care that i blew my last chance at college and i finally decided to see a counselor 3 weeks before the end of the quarter. My parents said the only reason i did that is because i knew i was in trouble and just needed an excuse. I don't know why i don't do the things i know i should be doing. I just feel like i can't. My parents say it's all my fault, that i don't take responsibility for anything and I just want to blame everything on something else. Which isn't the case. They don't think that depression has anything to do with not trying, that it doesn't affect rational decision making. I'm starting to think it doesn't either. I mean, why can't i do the things i know I'm suppose to do? The things that will better my life. The things that will make my parents proud?

You just woke up and it was fucking gone? Poof?   Everyone always has their golden fix for me too. My mom tells me to drink lemon water. My dad says “stop worrying so much.” My coworker says “meditate.” Exercise. Volunteer. Quit your job and go do what you love (which is what, exactly?).   I try so, so, so hard to not be depressed.

Just let go of the past.” These are the people that post dumbass quotes on Facebook and Instagram who haven’t experienced a day of depression in their lives. Let go of WHAT?

But I finally am starting to see it now I think that i'm really depressed.  I was never a quiet girl but now i'm so quiet that I think i'm scaring everyone.  but now i'm living with my wonderful boyfriend who seems to understand everything so well and is so patient with me.

"Does anyone else ""live inside their head""? Hi, this is my first ever post.   I feel like I'm living in my head 99% of the time. I catch myself forming conversations in my head between me and other people. It's pretty obvious because my lips move and I tend to smile when this happens. (A couple of my friends have pointed this out) Sometimes, the conversations are just between me and myself. I feel very numb during this whole process. The topic of these ""conversations"" revolve around feeling worthless in every aspect. It feels like life is against me. I'm average in every way (looks, intelligence, skills).

"Today is my 21st birthday. I'm spending it alone with a bottle of wine. Birthdays have always been a bit of a sore spot for me. To quote a very old comment of mine,   ""13th birthday: I had just been let out of a mental hospital a few days before. My mother finds out she has a brain tumor. My only friend at the time gets sick and goes home early.  14th birthday: All my friends but one bail on me. My parents scream at each other until my mother packs up and leaves.  16th birthday: My family and I go out to dinner to a restaurant that my dad chose solely because he had a coupon for it and buys the world's smallest birthday cake. Halfway through my birthday celebration the following weekend my friends abandon me due some drama bullshit that was apparently more important than me.  17th birthday : Dad starts an argument in the middle of a restaurant in front of my best friend. After we get home, the argument continues, resulting in my dad physically attacking my mother. All while my friend and I sat in my bedroom.""  To add to that, my friend's mother died of a heart attack on my 18th birthday, and I spent my 20th alone due to the fact that all of my old high school friends had moved on and my best friend had decided to join the military. Well, today was my 21st. My best and only friend completely forgot about me. My dad then made me have an emotional meltdown. Now it is nearly midnight and my only company is the nearly empty bottle of wine sitting next to me, so I am not only sad, but also slightly drunk.

"this is my first post here.  Just wondering if anyone else has this problem.  I can't seem to motivate myself to do something with my life.  I'm married, no kids, quit school a couple years ago, just working the same job for five years, going nowhere.  I'm afraid of any kind of change, and I sometimes feel like life is pointless.  I get in these ruts where I'm stuck in this deep, dark pit of anguish and depression and everything feels completely hopeless.  It comes and goes, but these past few weeks have been particularly bad.  I was diagnosed several years ago with ocd, which has a lot to do with it, since I work myself into a frenzy of worry, imaging the worst possible scenarios for every situation, and I just shut down and don't want to think about anything, and it's hard to pull myself together and function like a normal human being.

"I've been dealing with severe depression for sometime now, and within recent weeks it has hit its worst (most of my posts were in the MNSEN area): lack of sleep, stress, behind on my work, can't leave my apartment, constant crying, hopeless need, etc. And during these few weeks I have taken the steps into getting into regular therapy again by consulting psych services at my school in conjunction with the counseling I get (or hardly ever get) from my hospital. The severity of my depression has been taking a toll on my friends and last night it seemed to reach its pinnacle. I'm not sure what came over me, I wasn't even drunk, but I started lashing out at a friend of a friend that was at the same party as I was. I started to verbally bully and attack him because he ""annoyed"" me, I don't know why I have so much pent up anger. It rapidly went out of control and before I know it my friends were holding me back and I violently threatened them. For the first time in my life, my best friend (closest friend) had to physically hold me against a wall, almost hitting me, to get me to come down. I just broke down after that, it wasn't even about that stupid guy anymore. I was suddenly overcome with loneliness and fear an jealousy and embarrassment. I've always been known for a very short temper, and my friends all know me to be very emotional, but I have never gotten so violent; I've hit and thrown objects before in anger and frustration but I've never struck someone. Though they all tried to console me that night, I feel even farther away from the few friends that I do have. Everything was hazy from last night, even though I had hardly any to drink... it wasn't so much of an intoxication, but more like a violent breakdown of sorts. I was so angry and I was desperate to physically hurt someone; it was quite a scene since I'm a petite girl starting a fight with a passive aggressive 6 ft male--some laughed it off at first as a Napoleon Complex, but it became serious when they saw how out of it I was. I just remember being so hurt and angry at my friends; I felt so alienated which fueled my anger at the world, at my life more... (As cliche as that sounds). And today I just don't feel like going out and I can't help but feel so alone. The way my friend violently had to restrain me scared me a lot---I've never seen her like that, and she is certainly not the type to behave like that... I pushed her to that point. It brought me back to an ex-bf of mine that I was very close too and who saw the worst of my depression as well; he too at one point had to restrain me violently (against his character as well). After an off and on relationship of trying to stay together, he couldn't take me, or my emotional instability, anymore. Last night, I had friends breaking down screaming at me that they were never enough for me (to make me happy or content otherwise) and it just brought me back to that moment with my ex. I feel as if that this cycle is in all my relationships--romantic ones and friendships. I seem to constantly push people away. I don't know what to do. I don't miss my ex-bf at all, but I'm scared that I will never be able to have close relationships/friendships. Everyone I know just pities me. I feel so completely alone and pathetic.",dealing severe depression now recent week hit worst most post mnsen area lack sleep stress work leave apartment constant cry hopeless need etc week taken step getting regular therapy consulting psych service school conjunction counseling or hardly get hospital severity depression taking toll friend night reach pinnacle not sure came me not drunk started lashing friend friend party wa started verbally bully attack annoyed me not know pent anger rapidly went control know friend holding violently threatened them time life best friend closest friend physically hold wall hitting me come down just broke that not stupid guy anymore suddenly overcome loneliness fear jealousy embarrassment known short temper friend know emotional gotten violent hit thrown object anger frustration struck someone tried console night feel farther away friend have hazy night hardly drink not intoxication like violent breakdown sort angry desperate physically hurt someone quite scene petite girl starting fight passive aggressive ft malesome laughed napoleon complex saw wa just remember hurt angry friend felt alienated fueled anger world life more a cliche sound today just not feel like going help feel alone way friend violently restrain scared loti seen like that certainly not type behave like that pushed point brought exbf close saw worst depression well point restrain violently against character well relationship trying stay together not me emotional instability anymore night friend breaking screaming to make happy content otherwise just brought moment ex feel cycle relationshipsromantic one friendship constantly push people away not know do not miss exbf all scared able close relationshipsfriendships know just pity me feel completely pathetic,0.6584743857383728,0.5175727605819702,0.7255088090896606

"Can/Should I send her a dm? Hi   I‘ll start this with some backstory. A friend of mine plays in a band and last weekend I watched them live for the first time, it was pretty small with four other bands and maybe 15 people watched my friends band.  Anyway their lead singer is a girl who gave some weird vibes while on stage, but she was also very edgy so maybe it was that.  After the concert someone showed me her IG and I thought I‘d follow her. She and approved me and followed back. The first post she made after that was pretty much this summarized: I am having a pretty bad phase of depression right now. I have no motivation, cant take compliments serious, hate everything I do and am overwhelmed with the smallest social interactions (there was more but I‘ll stop here).   I personally have been struggling for the past few weeks with similar issues again and thought if it was okay to send her a message along the lines of this or if it would be intrusive:  Hey I saw your Post about your depression and can relate a lot to yo. I am a friend of guy and saw you live for the first time in city.  I know how shit it feels to have phases like this and won’t say it becomes magically better, but you are doing an amazing job with your music.

"Am I Depressed? While I've been distraught and suicidal on and off since age fifteen, I've never been formally diagnosed with anything because I don't trust the mental-health establishment. I've only visited a shrink twice: once when forced by parents, a second time when pressured by a partner.  Because of this, I'm reluctant to claim I'm depressed except in the loose, colloquial sense. Instead, I feel my rage and despair flow quite appropriately from my failure to fulfill my desires, achieve my dreams, and so on. I hate being alive and would adore a sudden death, sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm depressed, right?  I don't experience many of the symptoms of formal depression: I sleep pretty well most of the time, I eat okay, and I'm socially active. (I feel abjectly isolated, but empirically I spend a fair amount of time with friendly acquaintances at events and so on.)  I resist the medical model of my mental state because it assumes the problem's with me rather than with the world. I figure I'd be okay if I had the basic level of social success normal folks have: a number of close friends and a healthy romantic/sexual relationship with one or more partners.  I'm becoming increasingly confident my genetics and values combine to make forming meaningful connections with other humans effectively impossible. Because I yearn for such connections intensely, it's only rational that this dynamic would make my life unlivable.  I'm not depressed. My brain ain't malfunctioning; it's as valid a pattern as any.

"I just drove 1000 miles cause my Gma tried to OD and is in ICU. IDK if this belongs here. Maybe it will get removed, but I feel like I need to vent somewhere. My grandma has struggled with manic depression a lot through her life. I've always seen her as this strong independent woman. She has always been my favorite family member because just how kind and loving she is toward everyone and everything.  No matter how bad life has ever gotten for me or anyone else she has always had positive words. Well I never knew it but she's a bottler and my dad told me in the 90s she snapped and try to OD roughly 20 years ago. Combination with anxiety and stress and lots of other factors. Keep in mind everyone loves this woman she has 3 granddaughters and 1 grandson and loving kids. This woman is a saint in my family. He we are 20 years later again. My family and I live in Texas, meanwhile they live in Georgia and my dads sister/ gmas daughter and her family live in Virgina. My aunt plans to move back to TX. So my grandparents were planning to move to TX since everyone on the East Coast is leaving. When it came down to sign on a Realtor she snapped I guess again.... These are people in there 70s trying to uproot their life again and move across country. She tried to OD on some pills and my dad, sister, and I hopped in the car yesterday and drove from Tx to Ga. My Gpa said he noticed she was eating less but didn't see the signs. Now we surprised her and didn't tell her we were coming. Amongst other family all were happy to see us. My Gma I could tell wasn't the rock solid woman I always known her to be. It made me realize that you can be 70yo and still have these dark thoughts and try. She looked so weak and frail. So here I am in a different time zone trying to support my gma the best I can. My sister doesn't even know, she just thinks she's 'sick'. This woman has all the love in the world and that still doesn't help dark thoughts. IDK how I feel, I don't know how I'm coping. It hasn't hit me yet I think... Also my Gpa literally would not survive without her. Like she's the one that makes sure bills are paid on time and basically runs the house. She's his guide and he'd be lost and a wreck without her. Hes so shaken up and worried. On top of everything my girlfriend just tried the same thing but a different method and her brother called the cops and she got 5150'd and I've talked her once in 3 days. When she called I had just learned about my gma and I feel like she didn't get the support she needed from me.

"Hi, this is my first time posting a reply to something (besides the welcome new member forum). I feel uncomfortable replying to someone else when I don't feel like I have anything helpful to say, but I really need to get some stuff out, so I'll start here. I am staying at my parents' house right now for winter break (I am in college). I really wanted to come home but now that I'm here I think it was stupid of me to want to come home. Being at home with no one but my parents to talk to only fuels my depression. My dad is the worst. I feel like he's always judging me, and I'm a disappointment to him. I feel lazy and immature. I only have a few friends left here in my hometown, and I barely talk to them. The friend who I am closest to got a new boyfriend about a week ago, so she won't want to just hang out with me so much. And I understand that. The friends I am not so close to anymre, it is awkward talking to them. it always just goes back to high-school.

"How can I get my finances back to a point where I can go to school or to a point where I don’t hate my life? I guess some backstory. I’m 19 about to be 20 in September.   When I was in spring of 11th grade my mom got sick (Lupus or something, honestly she might be faking it but that’s a whole different post.)   Anyway she went to the hospital and was there for about a month. I ended up skipping a lot of school to be able to care for and do all the general house duties for my younger brothers. (11yrs old and 1yr old at the time.). Things progress my mom misses a lot of work we end up moving with my grandma.   Now here’s where shit really hits the fan. So tensions build between my grandma and my mom because of my moms suspected prescription opiate and Benzo abuse. Anyhow, dfchs gets involved (not related to the drugs but that didn’t help) about 4 months before I go to college and my moms health deteriorates seemingly out of nowhere. So freshman and sophomore year I’m juggling trying to work to support myself, school, and helping my grandma take care of my brothers. I thought I could handle it, I couldn’t.  Of course my schoolwork suffered and my gpa dropped below Hope eligibility.   So I tried to find a full time job, and I did. Then got laid off not too soon after due to “budget cuts.” My first time experiencing adulthood.  Shortly after my car died and my depression got to a dark place.   What followed is 3months of applying to anything I could reasonably walk to (I was trying to search within 5miles) because transportation in the part of Georgia I was in was a huge deal and I could not get around.    No jobs responded. Including the Walmart a mile away with a fucking hiring sign out front that I repeatedly went in to try and talk and build rapport with the managers.   During these 3 months I took out 3 credit cards and ended up maxing them out. I needed food and other essentials that I simply had no money for.   The depression kinda spiraled out of control.  I had a plan in place to hang myself but my friends at the time took the rope I was going to use and I was too broke to buy another.   My dad who has been in and out of my life. Mostly out prior to this. Invited me out to come stay with him and his family in LA while I tried to get myself together.  I’m working hard, I found a job here. Retail but it’s a job. I’m waking up early, I’m doing noFap and I’m working out 3x a week to try to keep my depression in check.   But despite all that, I want to kill die still.  I don’t see a future where I’m able to continue school. Dfchs told me they couldn’t help pay for college because “I wasn’t in for long enough before beginning college” but they had no fucking problem coming to my dorm and asking me questions and causing stress once a week.   I feel like I’m barely supporting myself, and honestly I haven’t talked to my brothers since the youngest ones birthday (April 15th). Because I feel like I failed them. I haven’t talked to my grandma either because I feel like a disappointment.  And my mom keeps calling me every other month telling me she’s gonna kill herself because she feels like nobody loves her. Even through I bent over fucking backwards trying to help her by bringing my brothers to see her and making sure they could talk.   (My grandma and the rest of my moms family won’t talk to her because she’s cursed all of them out horribly when they tried to be there for her)  ",finance point school point not hate life guess backstory september spring th grade mom got sick lupus something honestly faking different post went hospital month ended skipping lot school able care general house duty younger brother yr old yr old time thing progress mom miss lot work end moving grandma shit really hit fan tension build grandma mom mom suspected prescription opiate benzo abuse anyhow dfchs get involved not related drug did not help month college mom health deteriorates seemingly nowhere freshman sophomore year juggling trying work support myself school helping grandma care brother thought handle it not course schoolwork suffered gpa dropped hope eligibility tried time job did got laid not soon budget cut time experiencing adulthood shortly car died depression got dark place followed month applying reasonably walk i trying search mile transportation georgia huge deal not around job responded including walmart mile away fucking hiring sign repeatedly went try talk build rapport manager month took credit card ended maxing out needed food essential simply money for depression kinda spiraled control plan place hang friend time took rope going use broke buy another dad life prior this invited come stay family la tried together working hard job here retail job waking early doing nofap working x week try depression check despite that want kill die still not future able continue school dfchs told not help pay college not long beginning college fucking problem coming dorm asking question causing stress week feel like barely supporting myself honestly not talked brother youngest one birthday april th feel like failed them not talked grandma feel like disappointment mom keep calling month telling gonna kill feel like love her bent fucking backwards trying help bringing brother making sure talk my grandma rest mom family not talk cursed horribly tried her,0.4873411953449249,0.506397545337677,0.5286017656326294

I'm to blame, although someone I thought was a friend, complained about me - I don't do enough work, don't work fast enough, and do not work efficiently or accurately enough, and she complained to the right person. Let's get out of chronological order. Due to weird circumstances, I went for about 3 months without medicines, and therapy. In November, I was at the bottom of a deep, dark pit, so called my psychiatrist, Barry. Surprising for me, I went back with a new, improved attitude. We'd had a couple of productive sessions when annual reviews came out. I called him for advice, and thought that while the advice he offered was good, that he was not being supportive at all. I actually thought about how to discuss with him how his response made me feel, rather than just shut him out. We had a couple of excellent sessions, which apparently told him that something had triggered defensive coping skills, and where my mind actually was. Can't write anymore tonight, other than, Scarlet, hang in there, you're in for the ride of your life. You truly are going to be a fabulous mother, trust me.

"Everything has changed...  About four years ago I was the typical loner. I was in the middle school. Nobody took me seriously, because my hobbies were not shared by anyone else. I'm from a small town, so it was difficult for me to find someone who actually liked the things I did. At the time I liked things like anime, video games and MLP. I am a 19 year old lass now and I only like video games now.     In the final grade of my middle school I met a girl. She was about two years younger but liked the same things I did. I was so happy to finally meet someone like me. We have bonded a lot and she was the first person I truly loved, except for my family, of course.    About two years ago we started to get distant. She kept talking to me about things I was uncomfortable with, but whenever I tried to talk about something that bothered me, she told me she was busy and didn't hear me out. It escalated in June of 2016.     I started talking to her friends, because they seemed like such wonderful people to me. Then we met up, all of us. She kept crying and making scenes. Few weeks before that, she accused me of liking HER friends more than I liked her. But when we all met, it seemed alright, save for her crying etc...      When I got home the next day, she told me off. Really badly. She told me to go to hell, called me all sorts of names and I feared... I feared I would never be able to find someone like her again.     I tried to end it. Swallowed sleeping pills and drank alcohol. I woke up the next day in a hospital. I woke up to a text from her. One that said she wishes my mother was torn apart by the girl's dogs...   It's been two years. I've gotten better, met friends that helped me out a lot and I will probably never be able to repay it. But this past of mine, it still haunts me. I don't think I'll ever be able to trust someone like this again. I have gotten so cynical and careless about everything...

"I'm new to these boards and I hope I'm posting in the right spot...I have been diagnosed with major recurring depression since 1992. I have a host of chronic, painful auto-immune related diseases. I am also trying to care for an ill family member who just got out of the hospital and had major surgery (takes a year to recover from this surgery). This family member is pretty much bedridden and needs to be bathed, fed, and cared for much the way a private duty nurse would. It is a daunting task for me under the circumstances. Insurance will not pay for long term care and we cannot afford even the cheapest of help. Hence, I am managing all of it alone. Once in a blue moon, my in-laws will help but are very resentful on the rare occasion that I ask for help. My house is cluttered (I saw that topic) and I'm not sure if its because I'm so depressed or because I have been sick too much to take care of it. I think perhaps its both. I know that at least some of my depression is situational, but I also know that some of it is not. I am on medication, but the medicines have never done a whole lot for me. I've tried them all.

"Having a really bad stretch of days.. Hi all,  I know this sub moves kinda fast but I just wanted to vent, hopefully some of you read this..  So my story is that I've had depression and social anxiety for about 15 years or so (at least that's when I recall starting to feel ""off"".. I'm 29 now).. Because of my poor decision to bottle things up and accept that I'm unhappy I put off seeking help until about a month or two ago in which I started going to therapy. It had taken a rather bad mental fallout that occurred in early December for me to finally reach out for help.  In my sessions we've been working on techniques to combat both my SA and depression, these include going to places alone such as coffee shops, yoga classes, shopping malls, etc. (Keep in mind I have ""functioning"" social anxiety where I can physically be around people but I'm extremely uncomfortable the entire time and have a very difficult time interacting with people).. The thought process being that my depression stems from loneliness and my SA contributes to that.. It's been a big step for me to try and go out on my own, but I've been doing it almost every day even though it doesn't seem to be creating any improvement.  Unfortunately the last few days have been incredibly difficult, I'm getting a very sick feeling of hopelessness and worry that my life is now just constantly shuffling around desperately trying to find something in the world that will ""fix"" me. I tried to sit at home last night to give myself a break and I couldn't even do that, I started becoming consumed by those bad thoughts and began having a panic attack.. So I decided to just go drive aimlessly even though we were in the middle of a snow storm..  I feel miserable again today and I'm just running out of steam to keep going, I really don't know what to do anymore.. I'm exhausted from constantly forcing myself into uncomfortable public situations but at the same time my home feels like a prison.. I have nobody to talk to or gain support from anymore, the couple of friends that I have all have their own lives with wives and kids and my family has been out of my life for 10 years and for good reason.. I know nobody has answers as to what I should do but I just needed to rant ",having really bad stretch day hi all know sub move kinda fast just wanted vent hopefully read this story depression social anxiety year at recall starting feel off now poor decision bottle thing accept unhappy seeking help month ago started going therapy taken bad mental fallout occurred early december finally reach help session working technique combat sa depression include going place coffee shop yoga class shopping mall etc keep mind functioning social anxiety physically people extremely uncomfortable entire time difficult time interacting people thought process depression stem loneliness sa contributes that big step try own doing day doe not creating improvement unfortunately day incredibly difficult getting sick feeling hopelessness worry life just constantly shuffling desperately trying world fix me tried sit home night break not that started consumed bad thought began having panic attack decided just drive aimlessly middle snow storm feel miserable today just running steam going really not know anymore exhausted constantly forcing uncomfortable public situation time home feel like prison talk gain support anymore couple friend life wife kid family life year good reason know answer just needed rant,0.41839519143104553,0.4751019775867462,0.541004478931427

"My First Real Episode Hey guys... I just really need to word soup to get things out that have been on my mind that I have not shared with anyone close to me, I feel as if this is the only way to fight this feeling of sadness.    So to start everything off, I never thought that I would be typing these words as I am now. Not to say that I'm ashamed of it, but just because I never felt I had anyone to share with. I never have felt like I was able to confide in my close friends or family because I don't want them to carry the burden of my troubles, and I used to feel like it would just be a form of attention seeking to try and explain to others how I feel sometimes.    With that being said, I feel as if I truly hit my lowest of lows about an hour ago and the sad thing is that I cannot really describe the feeling... because all it felt like was just a severe sense of nothingness. I felt as if I was experiencing an out of body sensation, and my mind could not calculate any sense of emotion besides this feeling of dread that was accompanied by a warmth-like feeling starting from the back of my brain and slowly taking over my head.    It's been happening a lot lately during the night... especially since I've been moderately sick lately and it feels like my body is giving up on me no matter what I try... eating healthy and exercising only takes away the feelings of loneliness and sickness a little bit. What really helps is interaction with others, whether it be watching live programs or being on xbox talking to people or being in chat rooms because it gives me a small sense of community and belonging that I lose when my mind is left alone to itself.     I know it sounds stupid, but lately I've just been envisioning my feelings as the mind flayer monster from Stranger Things because it helps me make a little more sense of everything to a degree when I envision the feelings as something physical... I just wish it was a bit easier to find the focal point/issue that makes me this way to improve not only my life but also the lives of others around me.

"On the Verge of a Mental collapse Hello everyone. I hope we all make it out of depression.  I just want to post my feelings at this moment. It feels as though I'm on the verge of a breakdown. My life is in a very sad place. My parents are trying to keep upbeat and are hoping for the best. They know of my anxiety and depression. My mom drove me today and I didn't talk at all because I was in one of those moods I get in. I love my Mother a lot and she is very dear to me. I want to get out of this and become someone, but it is very hard. Anxiety has suffocated me and I'm afraid to go out in public due to feeling awkward and confidence issues.

"Debunking “stigma” Everybody who questions psychiatry often gets the response “you’re stigmatising people with mental health issues”  What’s more stigmatising? Telling people they have biologically broken brains with insufficient brain chemistry, and bad genes? Psychiatrists/psychotherapist within the biopsycho model of human emotions, only drug, or involuntarily “hopstialise” people  Telling people they can’t overcome their problems with life due to their bad brain which doesn’t operate correctly and the only thing they can do is take a psychiatric drug?  Subjecting people to isolation and distancing themselves from people as “different” due to “mental illness” and subjugating the “norm” from the “mentally ill” subjecting people to drug trials they have ended up in suicide and mass homocide, all for the progress of “psychiatric medicine”  Telling people that they have biological genetic brain diseases like “schizophrenia” and they’ll never really live a normal life.  Yet we’re the stigmatisers? YOU’RE the one who solicitates a lawyer when you have tried a psychiatric drug that almost made you kill yourself now you want to fight psychiatry but you’re okay with kids being chemically lobotomised on Ritalin?  How many more expansions of diagnosis in the dsm? does it have to be to wake you sheeples up that Collectivising human behaviour and giving them a label of “disease” with symtomps does it have to be to tell you that these behaviours aren’t found through cellular pathology, brain scans, blood tests, or some medical diagnostic criteria?  How many more deaths, school shootings, senseless violence, suicide by the administration of drugs? Will it have to be to wake you people up that psychiatry has killed more people throughout the entire history of the world than the Jewish halocaust?  It’s time to wake up and see that the “stigma of mental illness” is just psychiatric propaganda to deflect all the damage and life’s runid by their tortuous domain and authoritarian political reign.  Wearing a badge upon your head saying I’m “bipolar” is self deprecative as you’ve surrended your mental factilites and human experience/emotion for the NIMH who’ve admitted you can’t define “mental illness” and want to use you as some priori for the campaigns to sell treatment therapy and drugs.

"Depression and grief I am a 28 yr old M, who has been diagnosed with treatment resistant MDD from the age of 16.  Recently, I was attempting to get into a ketamine study in a NYC hospital and was asked a number of questions about my background. One item which came up that I have not thought about in a while was the specifics of my uncles suicide when I was around 13.   My uncle was a 28 yr old gay M, developed HIV and killed himself. Though this is not what I was initially told. It took around 10 years with every year or so getting a new piece of information. Initially I was told he had cancer and died. Then I was told he had cancer and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had cancer, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had HIV, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then, finally, I was told he was gay, had HIV and killed himself.  I think I secretly had an understanding of how he had killed himself even when I was a kid and was not told due to subtle hints that kids will typically pick up on. Even if I did not, I always had the feeling that something was wrong and that my parents were not truthful.  After discussing his death for two hours for the study, I realized that the depression I have been feeling for over 12 years is so similar to the feeling I get when I think of my uncle. Intense grief. I delved into the feeling more and have not been able to stop crying for the past few days about my uncle.   Does this make sense from a psychological stand point to be greiving for this long? I know there is no time limit on emotions but does it make sense for my depression to be as a result of shoving down his death and holding onto it for all this time?

"I made it so much worse Hey guys, haven’t been on reddit long, or this subreddit either. Never intended to post something, but recent events have changed that. So, I’ll start with some background,  I’m a 17 year old high school student. My best friend is 17 too, (Who will be referred to as Golf from now on) We didn’t even know each other before the school year started, but we had a couple mutual friends and we just... connected. It’s one of those friendships where it doesn’t really make sense, to anyone, let alone either of us, it’s like we’re family. It’s the only way I can describe it.   Anyway, we’re dipshit high schoolers, so we joke about depression and suicide in our friend group. The group knows Golf has depression, they have no clue about mine though. Anyway, when I started hanging out with him I did what I’ve been doing for a year and a half. Joking about my depression and making jokes about offing myself. I didn’t know Golf had it until a couple months ago, but soon after we started hanging out he started joking about it too. Well he got reported to the counseling center, a couple of times in fact. But they’re honestly useless, so it didn’t help. It came to a head last night when the group basically kidnapped him and forced him to go to a hospital. They didn’t tell me for whatever reason. I still haven’t figured out why. But eventually I got there. The night is a blur from there, I didn’t eat anything since breakfast, and that was noodles. As I’m just now typing this I realize that I’m at around 30 hours without food now. But that’s not important. I did my best to be there for Golf. He went home safe with his parents and is going to go to therapy/counseling. It was an awful day yesterday, a couple of events made Golf’s depression way worse for him. I’m glad we got him to the hospital before he hurt himself.  But it’s my fault, I know it is. I don’t need you guys telling me how it isn’t either. You wont change my mind. It is my fault, I taught him that suicide and depression could be treated as a joke. I made it worse. I hate myself for it. I don’t know what to do. Hell, I don’t know why I made this post at all. I don’t know if I want advice, or vent, or see if there’s someone else out there who has gone through something like this. Right now he’s on a trip with his mom and dad golfing.  Golf (the activity) is one of the few things he enjoys. All I want to do is lay in my bed and not exist in the outside world for the rest of spring break. I don’t want to take any attention away from Golf. He deserves it more than I do. I just don’t know what to do anymore.  (I’m sorry for the rambling and any punctuation/grammar errors).

"Just wanted to share Hey, first time posting here. Just wanted to talk to someone there since is not really any option irl.  I just kind of threw away all the good prospects in my life over the course of a week and have been feeling like a piece of crap. Probably not news to anyone here, that's how it usually goes.

"It's hard to keep standing up, keep fighting, and get down each time. I just want it to end I’m done. Hard work doesn’t pay off. Ever since I was 14 I felt depressed and like I’m not good enough. I felt like it was my own fault that I felt so sad and angry and that I wasn’t good enough for other people. One day I decided that if it we’re my own fault I felt that way then I could also improve my situation. Al my negative emotions went into working hard.

I want to meet new people and do new things, something that my friends aren’t interested in or don’t have time for. I’m as bad as you could imagine when it comes to making new friends because I can be really socially awkward and I’m convinced that few other people share specific interests that I would look for in friends or a girlfriend. I have few (if any) aspirations in life and I just feel like I’m drifting through life without any idea what I want. I don’t feel like I’ve accomplished much in my life, I’m in college but I’ve never held a job before and I’m hardly passionate enough about a career to really be interested to want to pursue it.

"Women ignore me, even here, they think I'm unworthy or too ugly to be helped. I even have the stats to prove it. Why am I so undeserving of love? I made a post yesterday today asking for help as to why I'm undatable and why no women wants to go out with me. I got 450+ views and only 6 comments, only 1 of which was from a woman. Everyone else was a male who either tried to give some advice or made fun of me. Here's proof: https://imgur.com/a/TRWg3  So if 250 women viewed my profile, only one person tried to say something. Everyone else ignored me. 1/250. 249/250 women think I'm ugly or not worthy of a relationship. Think about that. That's how unwanted I am.

"Reddit Secret Santa Saved My Life... I want to begin this by saying that I've been in a really dark place recently. Combination of family issues, breakup, and finals put me in a really depressive state. As a result, I'd been having strong suicidal thoughts for weeks. I had been seriously thinking about ending my own life. So that's the context in which this occurs.   About a month ago I signed up for secret santa on a whim. I had never done it before and honestly didn't expect anything. But yesterday, my gift arrived. I don't know who this person is, but they spent at least $150 dollars on about 6 separate gifts. They also included a really thoughtful and touching letter that talked about how they thought I was such a great person and how much they enjoyed learning about me.   I immediately broke down crying upon reading it.   It might seem small or sorta stupid, but it made me feel like someone cared about me. That I wasn't the idiotic nobody my depression tells me I am all of the time. I felt motivated and happy for the first time in weeks. I cleaned my room and did work that I'd been ignoring for months. I finally felt like maybe, just maybe, I meant something.   It changed my life, and probably saved it.   So whoever you are, thank you so much, and I can't express how much this meant to me or thank you enough.   And let this be a lesson to everyone else. The smallest act can and does make a difference.

"Desperately want to WANT TO get better Attempted suicide May 1st, wasted a week of my life in “voluntary” inpatient, was put on the one drug that has ever helped me (olanzapine, an antipsychotic) which I then promptly had an allergic reaction to, got off of, and crashed again.

I know it’s not healthy to live for another person but I’m not exactly in a position to nitpick.

"I think I ruined another friendship TL;DR: Made a wonderful friend, had a depressive episode, and ruined the friendship by trying to force my problems on her. Just like I've done a million time before.  I've had depression my whole life and I've always gone through episodes. Sometimes they're mild, and I'm just generally down for a few days, sometimes they debilitating and I can barely get out of bed for weeks. I've also never had a lot of friends. I don't have casual relationships. I either don't really think of you a friend, or I love you with every part of my heart. There's no middle ground.  I've been building a friendship with a great girl from work (call her Amy) for a few months. It doesn't seem like anything romantic is gonna come from it, but it was nice to have a friend I could do stuff with. We went hiking, rock climbing, we even went on a scuba trip to the Caribbean together. I'd opened up to her about my depression and she seemed really understanding. She actually seemed to appreciate how open and communicative I was about it.  The day before the Super Bowl, I felt an episode coming on. It wasn't severe, but it made me fragile. I'm a big Patriots fan, so when the Pats lost, it set me up for a bad episode. If I'd just been sad about the Patriots Monday and let myself heal like I usually do when my teams lose, everything would have been fine, but instead I started to blow my friendship.  I texted Amy Tuesday that I was feeling down and I'd like to see her. I made a big deal about how I wasn't crying about the Pats, but I was having an episode. It seemed important to me to point that out for some reason. She said someone was visiting from our India office and had a ton of work for her, but she would try to come over after. She worked until 930 that night and never made it.  Wednesday I left work at 10am because I was too down to stay. I was texting her the same stuff throughout the day, how I was sad and I wanted to see her. She worked until 930 again and didn't come, but this time she had never promised to. I texted her this big apology about how I've been a shitty friend and I'm sorry for forcing my problems on her. At work Thursday she told me to stop apologizing for everything. I told her I would try to stop.  Friday just felt different. She was less talkative with me than usual. She brought me cookies she made, and I thought that might be a sign that things were getting better, but after work I asked her if she had plans that weekend, and her answer was simply ""yes"". I said have fun and left. Normally she would have at least told me she a general idea of what she was doing.  I talked to my roommate/best friend (Samantha) about it Friday night. We agreed I needed to just leave Amy alone for the weekend, so I texted her and said if she found any free time I'd love to see her and then I didn't contact her again until yesterday at work.  Yesterday some things happened that really made me feel like things were ending. First, we had talked about planning a trip President's day weekend, but she had a surgery and she didn't want to plan anything until it was done (that's a whole other thing that's bothering me). When I asked her yesterday, she said she thought President's day was in March and she promised to see her brother this weekend, so ""we'll see"". She also told me she likes working late and going to the gym at like 930. Apparently she's been working 12 hour days for the past week. The gym part hurt because one of my favorite things to do with her was work out, and now I've lost my gym buddy.  I've had a lot of friendships go this way in the past. Speaking a little immodestly here, but when I'm not depressed, I'm funny, energetic, and interesting, and generally a fun person to be around. I've had lots of people enter my life, meet that me, like him, then after a few months meet the depressed side of me and just nope the fuck out.   Amy first met the depressed me a few months ago and she didn't run away. I thought she could be a big part of my support network moving forward. But I'm worried that I just tried to put too much on her. Like I've done a million times before.  The worst part is she sits right next to me at work. She's leaving next month to hike the Appalachian Trail, but until then, if I really did blow this, then I have to sit next to her every day for a month. I don't know if I can handle that.

"seeing other people having close, intimate relationships with each other made me so goddamn sad that I had to leave. I was at a party last night with some friends, and the whole time I saw people talking and hanging out like they were best friends and had known each other for years. It made me really sad because even though I have a wide circle of acquaintances, my mental illness and my fear of rejection makes it so hard to actually get close to people. I’ve been in college for a year and a half and I still don’t have any close friends that I text or hang out with. My friends from high school are all off at different colleges living their own lives now, so we aren’t close anymore. I kept thinking about this last night at the party and I got so sad that I left.   I can only really think of one close friend that I have, and even then we don’t really hang out that often.

I have been prescribed 40mg of paroxetine, but stopped taking it a couple of months ago as it wasn't helping me in my situation, which has probably made me physically worse. My depression probably stems from low self esteem and the feeling of general failure.

"Here's my story, however dull and blunt it may be ...  High school was great. Lots of fun You know-  Parties, beer, dates, sports and the works. I was never what one would call popular, however, I was respected by nearly everyone I went to school with. This, I feel was an asset of mine and helped me with self confidence as well as developing as a individual.  I'm now 19 (20 in June) and have no job, no money, don't go to school and have LITERALLY no friends, aside from my parents whom I still live with a leach off of (what a joke). I am virtually reclusive in my home with the occasional outing to buy cigarettes and to visit my Grandmother who is well near her deathbed.  I suppose my past bout with drugs may be a co - culprit influencing me to work in 'close to' complete isolation.  Maybe there is a cure for me but, chances are it isn't natural remedy. My addictive personality and past drug experiences has veered me away from trying the latest depression medications or any for that matter.  This condition of mine, whatever the fuck it is, started developing slowly. I would avoid large social gatherings at first, then I would pretty much steer clear of meeting with friends (even the closest of friends), and finally I wouldn't even take phone calls. At this point it's all of the above.  When I do confront a person, which by all means I try to avoid, I can't for the life of me keep eye contact like I used to and I seem like a complete, uninterested asshole who is simply in a rush and has no time for chat.  For instance, a two old friends of mine from high school stopped by at my house today to catch up on things. When asked what I was up to I looked at the ground and replied, ""Well ... I'm [pathetic excuse of a lie goes here] ...."" Nobody buys my shit. If I don't believe myself how can anyone else.?  So, here I am today. The table has turned. I am now the chump. The one without any respect OR self respect and the guy who respects anyone who isn't as lowly as myself. And I hate myself for it. It isn't as if I had a rough upbringing. My parents are and were loving, I've had so many friends, all the opportunities in the world. And I waste it all and continue to do so every stinking day of my life.  I'm not looking for sympathy. It actually matters little if nobody reads this at all.

"Drank too much and ended up in the hospital Let me start this off by saying I’m underage, so that just makes this just so much better.   Anyway, a handful of months back I had the smart idea to get drunk by myself. I don’t know what did it, I only drank a few shots, less than what I normally do, but whatever I guess it was destined. Next thing I know, I’m waking up all wrapped up in IVs with my mom next to me. I’m confused as all living hell. My mom just says “you drank the vodka,” looking more devastated than I have ever seen her, and then I cry myself to sleep.  Now I’m ruined. I’m broken. The guilt eats away at me all the time, constantly. As soon as I think of my family that’s all I can think of. Apparently I was found in a aggravated state, and upon being discovered I punched two holes in the wall, along with attempting to put in a hole in my father’s head. God I fucking hate myself. I’m not even a violent person, I hate hurting anything. Being anywhere around my home or family just makes me unbearably sad now. I had to come home and look my brother in the eye, and apologize for being so fucked up I tried to not only punch my dad, but a police officer who was forced to restrain me. By the way I don’t remember any of this, all of this my parents told me. You know how much that hurts? Not remembering a night at all, and it turns out you ran at your dad screaming, “fuck you I’m gonna kill you”  I hate myself.  I’m so full of regret and guilt and self hatred all the time. I hurt my family so much, and I continue to. I’ve had multiple emotional breakdowns since, when pretending to be okay just becomes too much. I’ve made my parents so concerned for me. Not only do they constantly think I’m high now, and do not hesitate to think every single fucking broken thing is my fault because I got “too fucked up”, but with the emotional rants I’ve had I’m sure they think im about to blow any second and kill myself.   I ruined everything. My relationship with my family is ruined. I love my parents beyond belief, and I know they love me too, but the shame, and the sadness I feel just being around them, it’s constantly unbearable. Nothing feels normal anymore. It hasn’t since that fucking day. I would give anything, literally anything to go back. I’d rather be completely paralyzed than do what I did to my family.   I have no care for myself at all anymore. I hate myself more than any other person. I’m selfish, impulsive, lazy, stupid, and above all less than worthless. If I wasn’t born I’m sure my family would be much more happy.  I can’t kill myself, because then I’d kill my whole family. My mom straight up told me if I kill myself that will be the end for her too. I don’t know what to do then. I guess slowly shrivel away or hope I get ran over.

"I’m trying to get communication back with my best friend. I have an idea, it won’t be easy and it may never work, but it’s worth a shot? Long story short: I’ve been depressed and I have a friend. I could make a 5 paragraph story about my friend and my depression. But I want to get to the point. I don’t want to make this post too long otherwise no one will read it.  My friend made the decision to stop communication with me until I go to a residential psychiatric program or somewhere similar. The thing is I’ve been in one already, it was a pretty flexible place, cell phones were allowed, doors were never locked, etc. Long story short I became “too high risk” and am not allowed back. And I don’t want to go back. I don’t believe in happiness by mental health, I believe in natural happiness. I believe that all humans deserve to feel happy without being told “your life sucks so you need pills and mental health treatment to be happy.”  So anyways, I can’t fulfill his wish. But getting communication back with him is all I want. There are no exceptions.  So here’s my idea. Just for fun I livestream games on YouTube. I do it for fun, not for fame, I don’t play those popular games, I play the ones that no one plays. It’s unlikely for a video to get more than 100 views. But I’ve considered starting a new channel. I will livestream games, post videos about my custom Guitar Hero songs (I do that for fun too) and just pretty much show that I’m having fun. But the big goal of the channel will be to “get my friend back”. That’ll be the whole idea. That will be written on every video. That’s what the channel art will say. Think of it as a gofundme, only I’m not asking for money, I’m asking for support from the public to hear my story, hear what I’m doing, and to be there with me when my friend does deliver.  Here’s the catch. For obvious reasons, his name will never be revealed. No one will have any idea who my friend is. But little by little, I will try to reveal the channel to him. It’ll start with the channel being named “Ian”, then sooner or later add my last name. As time goes on I’ll try and find ways to give him clues about the channel without actually telling him anything.  The big dream is that he eventually discovers the channel, and with whatever support there is, he will see how much I’ve mentally improved over however long it takes.  This all may sound totally silly, totally bogus, yeah, maybe this will never work in a million years. Just a wild thought that I’m going to attempt anyways.

"A letter to a person I let down To The Person I Miss The Most,  Happy birthday man, I miss you and I’m sorry. It feels like so much time has gone by that any attempt at reconciliation would do more harm than anything else at this point. We used to have so much fun, but nostalgia only makes everyone feel worse, and more often than not leads to poor choices. It’s a sweet substance, like sugar, just with a punch in the gut to remind you that you can’t ever go back to something you once valued so highly.  	 It’s been a year and a couple months since we’ve talked, and there’s rarely a day where you don’t cross my mind. I’m not saying that’s healthy, because it sure as hell isn’t, but who cares anyways. 	 I wasn’t good for you, you were too good for me, we crashed and burned and I loved every second of it. Was it worth it? Maybe. Does that matter? Not in the slightest.  Now I just sit alone in the dark writing you letters that I know you’ll never fuckin’ read, pretending in my head that there’s some fucking way that i can salvage the situation. It’s like watching someone stand at the bottom of the pool drowning, when all they have to do is swim to the surface.  I’m cold, and tired, wasting time and throwing away opportunities left and right because i have no idea what I’m doing, and I know that you’re doing well, that makes me happy. You deserve to succeed.  	 You’ve been to hell and back, and I might as well have been the chauffeur for a good portion of it.   I loved you, I don’t think I do anymore, but I know I did. I thought about comparing how I felt about you with a bunch of shitty metaphors but let’s be honest, that isn’t our style. We’d probably laugh at how cheesy it was and how stupid this whole situation is and then we’d pull out our guitars and write a beautiful sad duet and I’d be out of tune while you hit every note perfectly. But you wouldn’t critique me, that’s just the way you are.   Too kind, and sweet, too good to everyone you came across even though you knew there was a pretty good chance that they’d never return the favor. And man I really tried to, all those times we walked around talking about how much we wanted to die and how sad we were, but the whole thing was build on the back of our own loneliness and sadness.   But that’s the past. Nostalgia is bullshit, but I have to indulge once in awhile just to feel something, I’m sure you remember that. Here’s to better times ahead, and a letter left unread.

"Intense feelings of not wanting to exist/ wanting to escape and be alone somewhere forever I'm a first year in university and have suffered from depression since middle school. I've been able to manage my depression by having really supportive friends and through that, felt like I had a purpose in life. However now entering university, I feel like I have no purpose, no reason to exist and it is a lot harder managing my depression. I fill up my time with work and sports and stuff as a way to distract myself, but I just feel like I am going through the motions of life and everything just feels hallow. I think dying is such a pleasant and peaceful idea and am totally okay with it.

I was suprised to find out we had quite a bit in common and I felt so giddy every time I talked to her.

I don't know what I was expecting but she read it the note and walked away with the gift. She texted me a few minutes later she was nervous to reject me because she knew I was afraid and she would like to stay friends. I can't blame her for how she feels, it's her choice. Although, I feel utterly defeated. I have never been on a date or been kissed, or in any relationship with someone. I thought maybe this would be it, but I was wrong.

"My weight is ballooning out of control.  I take daily:  40 MG of Prozac (in the morning);  1 MG Klonopin (same time): 1 MG Klonopin (5 PM) 1 MG Klonopin (bedtime), prescribed by a psychiatrist.  I also take 1000 MG Keppra at bedtime for migraine prevention (prescribed by a neurologist).  I've been on various combinations of these for a couple of years.  The psychiatrist is doggedly insistent that the medications I'm on shouldn't be making me gain weight - but nonetheless they are.  I've had other medications that have given me side effects that I ""shouldn't"" have had - but nonetheless I do.  I have read many, many stories on the internet and through direct conversation with others that say they have had exactly the same things happen with SSRI's.  When I've asked him to change the medication, he keeps preaching ""diet and exercise"".  It hasn't worked.  I'm now down to the point where I eat virtually nothing and today I exercised to the point where I nearly blacked out.  This is causing problems between my wife and I (she also sees the same psychiatrist and takes Klonopin and Effexor), not least because I have no sexual desire.  None.  She sees him (the psychiatrist) tomorrow but I don't see him until April 6.  Yesterday in my therapy session I had an angry outburst that maybe I should just quit taking all the medication (because maybe I'm over medicated) and she didn't like that too much.  Am I going to have to die of obesity or over exercise to get his attention?  What do I have to do to convince them?

"Nightmares and dreams HI, I don't know about you, but when I was a kid I used to have this weird nightmares (not the teeth fell out usual nightmares) Like getting lost in a winter forest in pijamas just to be eaten up by wolves, being totally awake at my bed while insects ate me alive ( like sleep paralysis but dreaming?) or just watching my mother being eaten by feral dogs as she protected me.  Anyway, as I grew older and my depression grew with me, I stopped having nightmares, I can barely recall when the last one was. Instead I have pretty vivid dreams (not lucid ones) and in most of them, I'm at some kind of weird scenery where I feel like I've always been there, and weird shit happens that I can remember, and it's like a full story, a lot of different things happen in the same dream. The problem is, in most of them, I meet someone, normally a girl, with which I start a mutual relationship after overcoming some hardship, like, my biggest desire. These dreams, as good as they sound, are worst than the nightmares because when I wake up, it takes some time to realize that I did not live that shit, that I'm still in bed, and I'm still alone.",nightmare dream hi not know you kid used weird nightmare not teeth fell usual nightmare like getting lost winter forest pijamas just eaten wolf totally awake bed insect ate alive like sleep paralysis dreaming just watching mother eaten feral dog protected me anyway grew older depression grew me stopped having nightmare barely recall wa instead pretty vivid dream not lucid one them kind weird scenery feel like there weird shit happens remember like story lot different thing happen dream problem is them meet someone normally girl start mutual relationship overcoming hardship like biggest desire dream good sound worst nightmare wake up take time realize did not live shit bed alone,0.6133631467819214,0.42411381006240845,0.42698025703430176

"Writing out my feelings in hopes of gaining some sense of catharsis I'd like to start by saying I don't think I'm a danger to myself. I'm tethered here pretty strongly by my family and my best friend. I can't see myself leaving them, because I've seen what it does to people when those closest to them go. I resent the fact that I can't go, at times, but there's nothing to be done about it really.   Most of the people in my life only ever knew my outer shell. The somewhat false personality that I put on in order to function. Over the last three years my mask has been crumbling away and the results haven't been pretty. It's been a viscous feedback loop that leaves me feeling worse and worse as people fall out of my life one by one, either by their own choosing or because I distance myself to hide my pain as I become less and less able to handle it.   The summer after my sophomore year I was in the darkest place of my life. I had to pull out of university and move home to get therapy. It was actually very effective, and my junior year was a home run. I was getting the highest test scores in STEM classes with 600 students, I was killing it in my philanthropic efforts, and I had more friends and social obligations than I knew what to do with.   My senior year I spent the fall studying abroad in France. It was magical. I fell in love for the first time. I wasn't reciprocated, but the thing I learned about love is that it doesn't have to be reciprocated to be the most beautiful thing you've ever felt.   When I got back from France, the seeds of my current ruin were planted. All throughout college I'd been heavily involved with a camp for kids whose parents have cancer. I did it because my dad had cancer when I was a little kid, and the people I met were all wonderful, but most of all because the only thing that gives me a sense of purpose is helping other people. It drives almost everything I do. This camp gave me a rock that I could cling to through the worst of my emotional storms.   The two directors of the camp were both new my senior year. While I was in France, one of them dropped out of school due to her own struggles with mental health. The director that was left over was completely overwhelmed, and entirely ineffectual. People left and right were telling me that I should take the open position. I didn't want it; I have ADHD as well as depression and I was so anxious about my lack of organization. Camp was in such a hole though, and for the sake of my friends and my campers and their families I did the only thing I felt like I could do, and took on the directorship.   It was rough. My co-director continued to do little of anything, and I felt like I was juggling grenades. I couldn't fuck this up. Kids I'd been mentoring for years needed this camp to cope in a healthy way, and for a number of parent couples, the week of camp was the last time they got to spend alone together before one of them would pass away from cancer.   My grades dropped a whole point, on average. My volunteer research suffered, and I really let down the post doc I was assisting (Sorry Bethany). My mental health took a nosedive as well.    I made camp happen. It was ugly and bumpy and unorganized, but I made it happen. I took solace in the fact that the kids didn't seem to notice the flaws, but it didn't do a lot good for my relationships with the other volunteers.   I redoubled my efforts at the beginning of my 5th and final year of college. I moved into a house with some of the other volunteers who I was closest to. I had to quit my research, and I couldn't keep my grades where I wanted them, but camp planning was progressing well, especially after our national organization took notice of the lack of effort on my co-director's part and added a third director, my friend and newly minted roommate A.    A helped enormously, but I still had so much on my plate. To cope with the stress, my drug use started to skyrocket. I was smoking weed and cigarettes all the time, and to keep up with all my biochemistry coursework and 8-10 planning meetings a week I was taking my prescribed adderall more often than I should have been. I became thoroughly addicted. In my final quarter of school, everything really fell apart.   I was completely overwhelmed, and became less and less effective at my job. I put A in the exact position that I had been in the previous year. I could feel him resent me more and more every day, but I was too ashamed to talk to him about it, and he never asked me how I was doing.   I barely graduated. As soon as school was over I quit adderall cold turkey, because it had been putting me in a very dangerous mental headspace for weeks, but until then it had remained a necessity. The withdrawals hit me like a truck. Getting out of bed felt like a truly herculean task. I was an empty husk of a human being and from graduation to camp in August I contributed almost nothing to the camp. I had nothing left to give.   A hated me by that point. He began to tell people what he thought of me, and they listened. I watched helplessly as some of my closest friends and roommates began to look down upon me, if not for what A was saying then for my severely depressed behavior. I couldn't even really blame them. After camp, when we had our traditional fun awards ceremony, A was awarded ""Most likely to make camp happen by himself"". I was awarded ""Linger"", a camp song I was known for singing, but also a very pointed jab. It was humiliating.  At the afterparty that night I drunkenly told A everything. He said it was ok, and I cried lying drunk on the porch.  I lived in the house with him for a few more months while I looked for a job. A was incredibly distant, and became more and more hostile over time. I got a job on a crab boat. I had a few reasons for doing it, but the most important reason in my head was that I might be lucky enough for it to kill me. The day I moved out A sent me a 6 paragraph essay over text, detailing everything I'd ever done that had disappointed him, and letting me know that there was nothing I could ever do to win his respect back.   I left the state to work on the crab boat. For 5 months I lived in isolation, either working or chain smoking weed to keep myself from ruminating on all my failures. The crab boat did almost kill me. Multiple times, in fact. In the end I quit, not because I was suddenly afraid to die, but because my captain was the most sadistic piece of human scum I'd ever met, and I couldn't take him any more.   I've spent the 5 months since then trying to find a job. 50+ apps out and I'm no closer than when I started.

"A song of fire and ice Hey everyone. I'm on mobile so pardon my typos which will happen. I'd like to take this time to thank anyone who reads this as well as giving a shout out to anyone currently struggling with depression. I have a long history with Type 1 Bipolar Disorder. Although that isn't necessarily depression in itself patients who are Bipolar are bound to eventually oscillate into that emotional polarity.   To give a quick summary here is what happened to me: I grew up incredibly wealthy. My Father was an ex alcoholic. My Mother died when I was 13 and my Father went back to drinking to cope with the loss of his wife (my Mother). My Father became suicidal and threw everything we had away. We went bankrupt and I went to live with my Brother across the country.   My Brothers wife left him shortly after I moved in. He became suicidal as well, ended up hospitalized. I moved back across the country again to live with my then pseudo homeless Father.   One day my Father shows up to my school drunk, gets arrested, I am taken in by the state and put into foster care. I end up living with an incredibly poor hispanic family and eat almost nothing everyday. I have no bed. I sleep on the floor.    The state then places me in an incredibly religious home where i essentially become a slave and i cook and clean nonstop for an extremely wealthy catholic couple. They don't like me Because I liked hard rock.    My third stay I end up living in a small apartment with a woman who was good at hiding her side prostitution gig and methamphetamine addiction.   After all the years my Father gets his life back under control. He begins dating a wealthy woman who isn't a fan of me. He takes prolonged stays at her home about 40 miles away. He would visit the house to restock it with food, pay the bills, then leave again. During this time i saw my Father maybe 15 times a year. Each encounter was brief and lasted less than 30 minutes.   During this I still went to school, cooked, did my laundry, and did kind of normal kid stuff.   The point of this story is I am an adult now who is married. I am a software engineer. I am financially stable. Regardless of how dark it gets it is possible to make it out on top. You have to focus and be strong. Do whatever you need to do to survive.   If anyone has any questions or would like to chat, need advice, whatever please let me know. I currently do volunteer work to aid people who suffer from Bipolar Disorder as well as others like ADHD or OCD. I also, accidentally, mentor Fatherless children on Xbox Live (strange, I know).   Its not easy out there and world and parents sometimes forget how hard it is being a teen. No judgement. I hope everyone has a good night (or day, depending where you're at).",song ice hey everyone mobile pardon typo happen like time thank read giving shout currently struggling depression long history type bipolar disorder not necessarily depression patient bipolar bound eventually oscillate emotional polarity quick summary happened me grew incredibly wealthy father ex alcoholic mother died father went drinking cope loss wife my mother father suicidal threw away went bankrupt went live brother country brother wife left shortly moved in suicidal well ended hospitalized moved country live pseudo homeless father day father show school drunk get arrested taken state foster care end living incredibly poor hispanic family eat everyday bed sleep floor state place incredibly religious home essentially slave cook clean nonstop extremely wealthy catholic couple not like liked hard rock stay end living small apartment woman good hiding prostitution gig methamphetamine addiction year father get life control begin dating wealthy woman not fan me take prolonged stay home mile away visit house restock food pay bill leave again time saw father maybe time year encounter brief lasted minute went school cooked did laundry did kind normal kid stuff point story adult married software engineer financially stable regardless dark get possible make top focus strong need survive question like chat need advice let know currently volunteer work aid people suffer bipolar disorder like adhd ocd also accidentally mentor fatherless child xbox live strange know not easy world parent forget hard teen judgement hope good night or day depending at,0.3650355041027069,0.39597392082214355,0.34839197993278503
"I have been in two accidents one in October (went to take pictures of my sister in the parade, she was nominated for homecoming queen), and one in February.

I would give anything in the world to feel better. Last night I just cried myself to sleep, because I am not the only person dealing with this. I take my emotions out on everyone around me including my husband. Lately I can't help, but think he deserves better. I suppose I don't think I know.

"Cold turkey of Escitalopram So let me begin this by saying this is a terrible idea and I should definitely taper off with the help of my psychiatrist.  So, earlier this year after some lack of focus and insistent lethargy eventually my parents decided to take me to a psychiatrist. One thing leads to another and I am diagnosed with depression and put on a dose of escitalopram (generic form of Lexapro) 20mg a day. Have a history of depression on my mother's side, and they had all the symptoms pretty severely minus the suicidal ideation, which I believed supported their diagnosis.  So as school was finishing up and I had exams to study for, I spent most afternoons essentially consciously unconscious as I was too tired and struggling to keep a focus on homework and related tasks. Long story short told my parents I had been taking Adderall once and a while and we talked to the psychiatrist and he was very understanding and after trying to allow the SSRI to do its magic, he ultimately added an Adderall script to my regime.  So for some months I took the addy as needed and the anti-depressant as described (other than the days I forgot). So fast forward to summer and while I'm feeling marginally better, I was lead to believe the addy was doing most of the work.   So just last week I decided just to cold turkey the SSRI. Now, this was a slight test of seeing how I would react to abstaining from the meds (which is an awful idea). Strangely, I have noticed no real change whatsoever from when I was taking it to this past week of not taking it at all.  I am somewhat familiar with the omens regarding stopping an anti-depressant cold turkey and the associated rebound depression and serotonin-related issues, however, I am unsure why I haven't experienced anything. The optimistic side of me wants to explain this as my body just being weird and being able to withstand this drug-related anomaly. The pessimistic side of me believes that it's related to escitalopram somewhat length half-life and that a nightmarish hell awaits me very soon.  Just as a side note, at the same time as my depression diagnosis, I also got a blood test which delivered wonderful news that I had Lyme's Disease (which after much reading, I found exhibits many traits of depression and ADHD like disorders) and was promptly treated. Now I don't proclaim to be healed as I still exhibit a sense of lethargy, however, that might just be something I've become accustomed to and given getting out of my house, I am usually able to go out and be alive.  Obviously, not discussing this decision with my doctor is unnecessarily dangerous and naive, but I just don't enjoy taking the medication and this past week kind of supports my idea that I don't really need to take the medication if I am able to function fine without it.  Forgive me for this whole backstory of my last year, I just was unsure if some of this information might be useful in determining what's happening.  **tl;dr**: got lethargic and lacked focus this last year, diagnosed with depression and Lyme's disease, been on escitalopram since spring and Adderall (whenever I choose to take it) since mid-Mayish.  Have stopped taking escitalopram for about a week now and am not exhibiting any withdrawals or issues regarding the cold turkey. My question is: am I an anomaly or am I due for a bitter time in the near future?   QUICK EDIT: just wanna say I tried looking up this lack of side effects from cold turkey, but all I can seem to find is the side-effects of not taking the medication, so if someone has some website or anecdotal experience they can refer me to, that would be much appreciated :)",cold turkey escitalopram let begin saying terrible idea definitely taper help psychiatrist so earlier year lack focus insistent lethargy eventually parent decided psychiatrist thing lead diagnosed depression dose escitalopram generic form lexapro mg day history depression mother side symptom pretty severely minus suicidal ideation believed supported diagnosis school finishing exam study for spent afternoon essentially consciously unconscious tired struggling focus homework related task long story short told parent taking adderall talked psychiatrist understanding trying allow ssri magic ultimately added adderall script regime month took addy needed antidepressant described other day forgot fast forward summer feeling marginally better lead believe addy doing work just week decided just cold turkey ssri now slight test seeing react abstaining med which awful idea strangely noticed real change whatsoever taking past week not taking all somewhat familiar omen regarding stopping antidepressant cold turkey associated rebound depression serotoninrelated issue however unsure not experienced anything optimistic want explain body just weird able withstand drugrelated anomaly pessimistic belief related escitalopram somewhat length halflife nightmarish hell awaits soon just note time depression diagnosis got blood test delivered wonderful news lyme disease which reading exhibit trait depression adhd like disorder promptly treated not proclaim healed exhibit sense lethargy however just accustomed given getting house usually able alive obviously not discussing decision doctor unnecessarily dangerous naive just not enjoy taking medication past week kind support idea not really need medication able function fine it forgive backstory year just unsure information useful determining happening tlr got lethargic lacked focus year diagnosed depression lyme disease escitalopram spring adderall whenever choose it midmayish stopped taking escitalopram week not exhibiting withdrawal issue regarding cold turkey question is anomaly bitter time near future quick edit just wanna say tried looking lack effect cold turkey sideeffects not taking medication website anecdotal experience refer to appreciated,0.4616309404373169,0.47734665870666504,0.47236600518226624

"Hi everybody! I'm new here and I want to tell my story in brief and ask you a few questions. I'm 27 now. Female. I'm studying on PhD in one of the US universities. I've been suffering from different kinds of psychological problems (mainly, depression) for 7 years already. I always tried to handle my depression by myself. And only once, when depression became unbearable, I went to psychiatrist. I had therapy and AD for a few months. That was about 5-51/2 years ago. Now I have strong depression again. I feel that I can't handle it by myself and that I'm tired of fighting it on my own. That's why I've scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist. My questions: 1. I feel that this depression is different from depressions I experienced before :I started to masturbate like crazy (4-5 times a day) and can't stop - it has been like this for a few weeks already and I seriously started to think about involving  in some homosexual relationship (which I've never done before). I also started to read a lot of porno stories. 2. I'm thinking almost constantly about suicide. I mean, I don't think about committing suicide. NO. I WANT TO LIVE. It's kind of obsessive thought playing in my mind: ""I feel bad ...suicide...many people do that...suicide"". It's kind of always in my mind. Sometimes I even have a feeling of the rope on my neck (I don't think about other kinds of suicide which is, probably, explained by the fact that my father hung himself). 3. Where am I going guys? Am I going to some serious psycho disease or what? Am I still normal (I feel like I'm still normal). Have you ever experienced something like this? Honestly, what I'm afraid of is that at some point I might start seriously consider these suicidal thoughts. I think this is what happened to my dad. 4. I've been here, in the US, only for 1 year. So, I don't know how the system works. If I come to a psychiatrist and tell her that I have these ""suicidal"" thoughts will she make me to be in the hospital (I hate even think about this). Should I even tell her about that? Should I be very honest and open? When I went to our University Health Center to get a referral form, I didn't say anything about that. So, I'm a bit afraid of trusting a psychiatrist. Maybe, I don't need to tell her everything. What would be your advice? I'd greatly appreciate your help.

I wanna hang out with my friends to get rid of all these bad thoughts but I don’t have many, and if I ask them right now they’ll just answer “sorry, we can’t hang out, we have to study”.

"Ok I have a couple of questions...I guess. 1st is I finally managed to make myself an appointment with a psychiatrist (it's not till May). Now I'm having second thoughts about it. I just pretty much want to go in for an evaluation (to see if there is a problem) and see if maybe there is a short term solution for the suicidal thoughts I've been having. I've got a summer job I'm leaving for in June and than I'm moving to another city after that. (So basically something till I'm stable with where I'm living and job). I assume I'm only going to be able to see 1 doctor, 1 time before than. So 2nd thoughts have been should I just wait to see someone when I actually get settled. Also if a psychiatrist is who I want to see (I've never been to anyone before for my mental health)...that's what the intake coordinator suggested. Also I was wondering if they could hospitalize you for suicidal thoughts without your permission? Ok now on to the suicidal thoughts questions (and just so people know I do not feel myself to be in any immediate or near immediate danger to myself). One main thing is does depression have to be present for suicidal thoughts/actions? I often find my mind turns more to thoughts of suicide and death when I feel relatively normal mood wise. And that when I have feel really depressed the thought of suicide rarely crosses my mind (but the pain is more severe). I guess that's really all I have. Sorry if the topic is inappropriate for this forum. I just wanted to ask...and maybe discuss with someone...but don't really feel that it's a problem for me right now. If someone wants to talk in PMs I wouldn't mind either.",ok couple questionsi guess st finally managed make appointment psychiatrist it not till may having second thought it just pretty want evaluation to problem maybe short term solution suicidal thought having got summer job leaving june moving city that so basically till stable living job assume going able doctor time than nd thought just wait actually settled psychiatrist want i mental healththat intake coordinator suggested wondering hospitalize suicidal thought permission ok suicidal thought question and just people know not feel immediate near immediate danger myself main thing doe depression present suicidal thoughtsactions mind turn thought suicide death feel relatively normal mood wise feel really depressed thought suicide rarely cross mind but pain severe guess really have sorry topic inappropriate forum just wanted askand maybe discus someonebut not really feel problem right now want talk pm not mind either,0.41710925102233887,0.43014535307884216,0.3620446026325226
"I'm sort of new... Here is the short version: I'm 26 year old man. Single. No kids. I live in Arizona (USA). My father was a workaholic, and an alcoholic. So usually he wasn't present, and when he was he was abusive. In addition, mental illness runs in my family. At the age of 5 I was sexually molested by a neighbor. I can recall my anxiety always being there. It's something I have always fought with especially in social situations. My family completely isolated me when I was growing up, in the name of protecting me. As a result I never really learned social skills until I was older. I grew up being abused by my peers throughout school. Found myself taken in by the only people who would accept me as I was: the misfits, outcasts, drug-users. Early into my teen years depression came as an addition to my anxiety. Around 16 I started to get into substance abuse. The only thing I ever used was LSD on weekends regularly. A year later this extended into ecstasy and LSD. I had a traumatic experience and stopped using anything about a year after that. My anxiety became so overwhelming I could not function. So at this time I first started seeing a counselor and a psychiatrist. They put me on Clonzepam. My last year in high school my father was starting to lose it so my mother asked me to leave so we didn't kill each other. I had an inheritance from another relative and I lived off that. I went 2 whole years without speaking to my father. I sunk deep into depression, and returned to substance abuse. The Clonzepam wasn't working anymore. After being outcast from my family, I went full on into the dark side. What was just LSD and ecstasy usage branched into cocaine, meth, marijuana, and virtually anything my friends and I could find. This culminated in an extreme suicide attempt about a year out of high school. After getting out of the mental hospital, I went totally straight and haven't touched any drugs since then. The 8 years following have been a rollercoaster. One moment being on top of the world, having everything I could ever want. Another losing everything. Several long horrible relationships occurred in this time. Over the years my doctor has moved me around on various medicines. I have been using Effexor since 1998.

"I need help Please help, I don’t know what’s happening and I can’t control my emotions. I’m losing it.    I went to my mom’s house and when I got there, there were guests staying over that I didn’t know. I have very severe social anxiety so this is not good. When I called my mom before driving to her house, she specifically said that no guests were over and it was okay to come. She lied.   I went inside the house and asked my mom about the guests, she told me that she intentially lied to me because she wanted me to come over and knew that I wasn’t going to come over if there were guests there.    I freaked out. My mom completely disrespected my boundaries and said the equivalent of “fuck your social anxiety, do what I want”   I quickly left the house and went back into my car. I wanted to leave there because I knew I couldn’t handle socializing with other people. However, my mom followed me back into my car and started to ask why I was leaving. I tell her that she lied to me and I can’t take deal with my social anxiety. She says she doesn’t believe my social anxiety is real (mind you, I’ve spent two month in a psychiatric hospital last year) and says she wants me to stay. I tell her fuck off and get out of my car but she doesn’t leave.   At this point I don’t know what to do so I freak out. We have an argument for an hour. She’s not leaving my car and is yelling at me. We eventually decide that I should go to my sisters house to sleep.     I leave but now I have so much anxiety that I can’t drive. I park my car in a nearby parking lot deciding what I want to do. I have so much anxiety at this point that I made a post of /r/suicidewatch but quickly deleted it.    Then my mom calls me and eventually asks me if I am driving to my sisters house. I don’t respond to the question because I don’t want to lie, and she finds out that Icwas nearby.    She freaks out. She accuses me of lying to her when I didn’t lie. She then takes her car and starts to find where I was. She finds me and then we have an argument for two hours. She keeps on yelling at me saying that I should come back to the house and “forget about my anxiety”. I tell her I wanted to go back to the psychiatric ward in the hospital and she says that I’m being fucking ridiculous and should stop thinking like this.

"I have had borderline personality disorder since I was a little kid. Although then the therapist said it was Bipolar Disorder and ADHD. Since then I have been on pretty much every medication you can imagine and even sent to a temporary mental hospital. It isn't until now that I self diagnosed myself with BPD. I don't even think my doctor really thinks I have that although considering all the research I have done I fit the description perfectly. Since the age of 13 I was being self destructive by slamming my head in the was during times of stress. The first time I starting cutting was when I was 21. This was after an ex boyfriend left me. We had only been dating for 3 months. Sad huh. This went on sporadically for about a year and a half (during that time I committed myself). Finally I started dating my next boyfriend. He told me if I didn't stop cutting he would leave me. I stopped. We dated 2 years and then broke up. I am now 27 and married to another man who is 12 years older than me. We have been married almost a year (together for 3.5 years) and about 3 months ago I started cutting again. This time it is 3 times worse and I can't seem to stop. I am covered in scars and I have even gone as far as cutting the inside of my wrist. I am currently on Wellbutrin which does seem to be working (I do have a lot of good days). Although since I started to become depressed again I have been having a hard time dealing with the fact that my husband has a son. It didn't bother me as much (just a little) before because I did my best to stay busy. Since I got married I lost all my friends and now spend every other weekend alone. Mostly in bed. I never had to play mom before so I never thought I would ever be in the position to, so I just stayed out of the way. Plus, his son doesn't like me being around. Which makes me feel worse. In my state of mind I can't deal with that. My alone time is when I cut the most. My husband and I are in therapy, my therapist wants us to work. I am not so sure I can stay with him. Although I am having a hard time leaving. I am just so tired of feeling so alone all the time and he is just not capable of being there for me. This puts extra stress on him and I don't want that. Plus, it is my fault I married him, I knew he had a kid. I guess I didn't know I would get bad again. Last week we talked about me leaving. He ran upstairs and cried (he said he will fight for me) I went straight for the exacto knife. I had suicide in mind although I see myself as a wimp in that area which makes me feel even worse about myself. I cut 5 times on the inside of my wrist but I guess not deep enough. He came down and found me. My antidepressants work almost 80% of the time but whenever I think of losing my husband I get sad and hopeless. Every time I think of staying with him and feeling the way I do all the time I get sad and hopeless. I feel cornered. Cutting make it all feel better, suicide sounds comforting.

Sometimes I get a burst of motivation and try to do something but I give up really easily.

"Feeling trapped in my head First off I'm Autistic, I'm studying at Oxford I'm struggling to remember anything, like anything at all, people, faces, dates, facts, etc. I'm feeling more and more alone because I don't feel like I have anything good to think about. I have a girlfriend, she's in the forces and has a lot of structure and meaning to her life and I like that but I see my life as completely pointless.    So about a year I was cycling in the dark and I was hit by a car, I flew over the bonnet and hit my head. I was out for about half an hour, till I regained conscience in the back of an ambulance, and the crews were cutting off my clothes and pumping me full of morphine. Before this accident I had a very good memory, and my parent would say I could talk about anything that had happened from when I was a child. I was having some weird relationships at the time with different people, and I only came out to them after I was in hospital for a month after the accident, I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to worry them. I valued their feeling more over my own life, and I still do that now with other people.   Things started to crash after the accident, I lost people really good friends and I knew it was me, and I changed and something during that accident had altered me, and I hated it. I started to forget people very quickly and events that had happened and horribly people who had died and continuously not realising they had died. That upset a lot of people. Before everything happened I had broken up with a girl (but i didn't realise that after), now I can't remember what we did together or even how we met, but I can't get the thought of her out my head, she later told me to leave never come back, which I did. But even now I still have the feeling of thought of her, and I'm struggling to get rid of that, I don't love her and I'm not in love her, I just feel like i'm obsessed with her a person I know nothing about and It haunts me.   I've been to a few separate doctors and have been recommended medication, which I believe it has just made it worse. I've talk to my parents but they just talk highly of the pro's of medication and councillors. Hate councillors. (I always ended up lying to them)   Since everything I've had some real down point, and made two attempts, by failed due to people walking in randomly either whilst in progress or while setting up. I've already made necessary precautions by writing letters, addressing them and stamping them but non have been sent. I want to tell my gf but I feel like, I don't want to throw feelings away by her thinking 'he's a sobbing kid, or he's crazy or why am I with him' - I'd rather hide it not to upset her, people mean everything in the world to me, and I'd give my life for her, any day. But I still want to tell her, and I don't her to be scared of me.   When I close my eyes and think of a memory, I just see grey mist or static like of a television. It doesn't feel nice not having anything to fall back on in your mind, things that made you happy.

"People I love keep dying. I can't take it anymore. On New Year's Eve I got a phone call at 1 in the morning that one of my closest friends died. I didn't believe it. I thought it was a joke. It wasn't. His brother made a post on Facebook letting everyone know. It felt like a bad dream.  I couldn't stop crying. I cried at work. I tried to get time off, but they didn't offer bereavement for people who weren't immediate family.  I was so distraught that I couldn't go to the funeral. I was afraid to see his body. I hate myself for being so weak. He was 28. It shouldn't be. He should still be alive.  Four months later, my grandfather died. We were close. The last time we talked he said ""that's my sweetheart, that's my pride and joy."" I sat with him in the hospital and watched Aubrey Hepburn. We promised to see each other again soon.  I saw him a week later in hospice. He was catatonic. I told him it was okay to let go, okay to move on if he was in pain. They say hearing is the final sense to go. He died thirty minutes after I left.  On July 1st my mother told me that she's been diagnosed with cancer. They took a biopsy of her lymph node yesterday to see if it has spread there. She is on a month of leave from work.  That was the final straw for me, I think. I feel like a shell of who I was before December 31st. I am terrified of the future. I remember when my friend died, I asked myself who I would lose next. I had no idea things would spiral down and down.  Everyday is a struggle for me to stay at work. All I want to do is sleep. I have constant migraines (a chronic condition), and the pain paired with the grief is absolute hell. I started seeing a counselor about a month ago, and I like her but she can only do so much. I am on medication, and I have a good support system.   But the sorrow is just overwhelming. I feel like this grief is never going to end. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to them. I don't want to lose my mom. I'm not even thirty. I'm not ready to wake up knowing that she isn't with me anymore. I can't take anymore. I have been crying all day.

"Any advice on how to handle leaving my only friend? LAST thing I need right now is the pain but I think I have to. I've posted here a few times before and never got much for replies, which is ok.  I really do hope I can get some insight on this particular issue however.  For so long I've been completely alone and it really sucked.  I managed to connect with my Cousin a couple of years ago and we've had a lot of great times, but more often than not lately it seems I feel bad after dropping her off instead of good that we hung out.    We've hung out like 3 times a week for a couple years now.  I feel like we have a real connection but she doesn't show it if she feels the same.    I'm an alcoholic and so is she, so we drink together a lot.  I certainly would be able to quit if I didn't have to drink to be around her.  Besides the booze I have no idea what other drugs she's into; I know coke for sure, probably smoking crack time to time, she's made jokes about wanting to go out and do meth all night.    She's CONSTANTLY lying to me about everything.   She is so very unreliable, in the last 2 weeks twice now she's made plans with me for the next day, only to show up on facebook at like 8pm after I've been sitting and waiting for her all day and then she gets angry with me for telling her it makes me feel like shit.    Everything is always about her, she's even more depressed than me and has none of the coping skills I do so most of the time it's just her bringing up all her problems and me trying to reassure her.  If I try to talk about my issues though she pays no attention and changes the subject.    I know she's not really a ""friend"" more of a ""company prostitute"" if anything, it seems like I'm always having to buy the booze or lend her money she never pays back.  I know I am being blatantly used, but the company is still better than being alone with my thoughts all of the time.    She actually ""ghosted"" me about a year ago for a few months and that put me in a really bad place, I had to check into the psych ward I was in such a rut over it.  When we finally started hanging out again she didn't seem to care at all the pain it caused me, and I still have never heard an answer ""why"" she'd block me and dodge my calls or visits out of the blue.    I feel like she's getting worse and no matter how hard I try I can't help her or make her seem to care.    I don't think I can handle the pain of losing my ""friend"" again.  I also have OCD and I obsess on things to ridiculous lengths and this is going to suck me into a dark hole for a long time.    I suppose I actually came here hoping people would tell me not to ditch her, but I know I can't keep letting her treat me like this.     How do I do it on good terms?   How do I get over it and not let the grief consume me?

"Ideas for sleep? Hey guys, I’m not sure if I’m depressed, I’ve never been officially diagnosed. However, I feel a sense of deep sadness and fear almost constantly, but I hide it super well. The fear aspect seems to get worse at night, im not afraid of one specific thing it just turns into an overall consuming dread. I want to cry like 80% of nights but I simply can’t. I also want to sleep more than anything in the world, it’s my favourite thing. However, I can’t sleep, no matter how hard I try I normally lie awake for hours and when I do sleep I just wake up like 5-7 times a night. I only want to use sleeping pills as a very very last resort. I try to not use electronics before bed, or to watch something happy, but that feeling of being small and smothered and scared and full of dread is still there. Any ideas on how to make it better?

"I don't think who try to kill themselves actually want to die From my experience and one of a close friend who almost died in a car accident, I think people don't really want to die. We just want the pain to go away. All the shit we take  and all the heavy baggage we have to carry, just makes us tired and lose hope  When we ponder on death, we see an easy way out, so as to get rid of the unbearable agony we suffer.   Moreover, I watched a video of suicide survivors. About those 7% who survived suicide, claimed that in their final moments, when they were throwing themselves from a high place, they said they'd regret everything and wanted to live. Now imagine all those who died and regretted in the last moments.  Personally, I've been close to do it, but my online friends gave me so much support and so much love that I noticed that it's not worth it. I still have things I want to do. Sure getting out of bed is still a huge task. Today it took me 2 hours just to do it, but I did it.   I'm not sure if I should have posted this in suicide or here as it has to do with both.

"I feel trapped in a life I don't want to live. It took a lot of time for me to consider posting here but I'm gonna be alone for the whole day and can't deal with it. So, hi, I'm just your typical British kid dealing with the stresses of College but the problem is that I'm not stressed because of college (I don't really care much for it but it's better then work), I'm stressed because of this constant cycle of: wake up, spend an hour trying to get up, be 20 minutes late to everything every day, eat, browse the Internet and sleep.   All around me there's people who have clear career paths and know what they're passionate about, but I look at myself and realise that I don't have that. I have no interest in working in a job for the next 45 years of my life because there's nothing that I'd like doing. I'm doing fine in all of my classes (As in History and Cs in Maths, Distinctions in BTEC Engineering, everything just feels too simple) but I just still get these weeks where I feel worthless and pointless. I get brain fog, I end up teary eyed and can't talk to anybody for fear of looking stupid (I have speech problems). But then when I end up actually talking to others I apparently look happy.  I have spoken to people at my school about it, but it's the same thing every time. 'Oh you're struggling? We'll have a five minute conversation about your feelings and wait months to make sure you're not still sad'. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I stopped taking medication in July 2017 and haven't seen a doctor or therapist since. They didn't help, the medication I was on turned me into a god damn zombie and my therapist got exceptionally pissy at me for not telling the truth about my lack of improvement. I felt like I had to lie so I didn't waste their time and mine, I worry that's why I end up wearing a mask 90% of the time. Even around my family, who believe more in self-help then actually getting an actually decent therapist to try and help me. I'm ashamed to talk to them about it, no matter what anyone says, trust me when I say that they will NOT understand. I have been incredibly clear about it all and got mocked for it, some people just don't want to learn.  I had a pretty bad childhood that I try to justify my problems with (dealt with a lot of sexual abuse and my mother died in 2013) but when I'm having these 'days' I'm not thinking about anything in particular that would make me flighty. I ended up admitting a lot of my past to one teacher last week who I admire greatly and whom pretty much just saved my life and I am still cringing today. I know I have no reason to cringe either, I just get so nervous of social interaction.  I just don't get why the universe picked me to be its miserable little experiment. I never asked for anything bad to happen, I never asked to constantly feel tired and under the weather, I know that life isn't gonna be perfect but why is it that day after dull ass day I have to feel worse and worse?

"I walked out of a job yesterday. I took my 'dream job' in early January, only to discover that it isn't my dream job at all.  I thought I would like working in a medical office, but this particular medical office has two doctors, one part-time staff member, and a cluster of other problems.     I quit on Friday; the owner asked me to come in yesterday and meet, and I did, but I didn't stay long, because she didn't show up and the other doctors on staff acted like my resignation never even happened.    I've compiled a list of why I quit. Here's a short sample:   - I hate the hours (7A-7P 3 days a week, 7A-2P 2 days a week; an hour lunch break was promised in the new hire handbook but is frowned upon by staff as a lack of commitment/dedication)   - There are religious currents, including periodic 'prayer meetings' throughout the day.  I was treated dismissively when I objected and stated I'm not religious.  The owner is okay with the prayers, and says it brings staff closer together.   - I was offered a management position, but after being hired, was told ""I know nothing, and might manage eventually, but right now was incapable of doing so.""   - I was trained for three or so days before being expected to run insurance billing, keep rooms clean and do therapies, and run the front desk.   - Staff is expected to remain available on evenings and weekends for PR events.   I know that quitting was the best decision - ""sticking it out"" would have been detrimental to my mental health, and I would have had no time to interview for other opportunities.  Still, at the same time, I can't help but feel like a burden to my husband.     After leaving yesterday, I hiked 4 miles to the top of an area mountain (really just a big hill, it's a foothills mountain) and had a conversation with myself as to whether or not I intended to jump.  I intentionally didn't take my gun with me because I never know.    I am afraid of being a disappointment, and I am afraid of never being a 'conventional,' 'functional' human.  I am second guessing my decision to leave. I already have other opportunities presenting themselves to me and I am lucky enough to have some money put away... but I don't want to be a failure.

"Does Trading Help Your Depression? Maybe I am a bit weird in this regard, but I do quiet well in this regard. I have not traded too much because of life circumstances, and thus the past few years have been depressed, as my one best friend is in jail and the other has adopted asceticism. I also moved to a new area and broke up with my ex. I have been thinking stuff over, and even though winning at coding can make me slightly happy, I feel like whenever I am trading I am on fire and feel like my ""true"" self, whereas otherwise I feel blah. When I mean trading I mean medium term investing based on value investing. IDK if the risk and reward part overruns me, but when I think about that I don't think about my lack of dating or how this or that sucks, I focus on kicking ass and taking names.

"I Empathize More With the Dead Than I Feel Bad for the Living There have been a few times in the past few years where I found out someone I went to high school with died of whatever means. But within the past few months, whenever I found out someone died, I didn't really feel bad for their family, I mostly was kind of jealous that they were gone and I was still here.  For example, my mom manages a nursing floor at a hospital. She told me one of her nurse's daughters died of a deadly disease at 20. And all I could think about was at 21 all I could think was how jealous I was of the deceased young woman, and how lucky she was. No ill will to her, I hope she rests in peace and that her family is coping.  Another example. When I was in high school, someone I knew had an older brother than went out drinking one night and when he came home, he died, choking on his own vomit.  Again, I feel like there should be a lot of cautionary tales in this, but mostly I just wish I was the one that was dead.",empathize dead feel bad living time past year went high school died mean past month died did not really feel bad family kind jealous gone here example mom manages nursing floor hospital told nurse daughter died deadly disease think think jealous deceased young woman lucky wa ill her hope rest peace family coping example high school knew older brother went drinking night came home died choking vomit again feel like lot cautionary tale this just wish dead,0.5524851679801941,0.42081451416015625,0.5094122886657715

I have all the networks and connections in the world to be successful. But I feel so unhappy and miserable with my life. My thoughts are so irrational and negative that I can't see how fortunate I am to have all that I have. I make great money with my summer internship, more money then most adults make, but none of that matters, because I still have suicdial thoughts almost everyday. I feel hopeless all day, everyday.

"I feel really bad for not coming to the forum much last week. i have been in turmoil. Things at home are not going well at all. My husband got his new house and is moving in the next few weeks ... incidentally that is not the problem. I am happy that he is leaving. He has been a real jerk lately. He says mean things to me and he is angry all of the time. He has been working on the road for the past month so we only have to tolerate each other on the weekends  - thank goodness. When he comes home the first thing that he does is go up to the computer room and say hi to his buddies ... not to me and not to our son (in fact he only spend a total of one hour with our son on the weekends). When he finally graces us with his presence he just complains. I did SO much work around the house last week - I cut the grass, weeded the garden, watered the lawn everyday, vacuumed the house from top to bottom, washed the floors on the main floor of the house, did all of the laundry, patched some dents in the walls and painted them, cleaned out our son's room .... and still he managed to find things that were 'wrong'. He even had the audacity to tell me that I am a pig and nothing gets done around here. I just can't take it anymore. All he does is get angry and complain. I finally realized this weekend that I am not his problem. He is just using me as an excuse. I have tried to talk to him and all he wants to do is play the blame game. We have agreed to not see each other for the month of august so that each of us can decide what it is that we want to do regarding our relationship. Even that ticked him off. When I asked him if he would like me to send our son with his parents when they come to visit him he got mad that I wasn't going to come see him. The 'no seeing each other in August' was entirely his idea. I have no clue what is going on in his head. I have tried and tried to talk to him and the only reply I get is defensive or aggressive. I am at my wits' end and am about to give up. I care very much for him and I know that there is something wrong but I cannot help him. I am so afraid of giving up on us though because I am riddled with the 'what ifs'. I want a family so bad. am I settling though? I hate saying that because my husband is not a terrible man. He has his finer qualities it is just that lately they are few and far between. He has even told me that he would cheat on me if given the chance. And that he might have while drunk one night and that the girl has told other people that the baby she is carrying might be his. You know the more that I write the more I feel like an idiot. What a fucking doormat. What the hell am I doing? i am putting my happiness and wellbeing on the back burner for someone who has told me repeatedly that he no longer loves me and thinks that he has had an affair (or at the least would like to). How pathetic can you get. What a glutton for punishment I am. Why is it that I feel that he is more important than me? You know I thought that I was doing better on the medication - I might not be having the emotional outbursts but I still have the low - or should I say non-existent self esteem. If only all of this could be over. If only he could either WAKE up and figure out what he wants to do or just fuck off and never see me or our son again. That would make my life so much easier. I fear for my son. I do not want my husband's anger to hurt our son. I don't want husband to take out his frustrations on a two year old. I worry about sending our son to visit him. Without me there or the dogs, xxxx is the only one there to take the abuse. Anyway that is what I have been dealing with the past week. As a result of all of this I have been on a self destruct mode. I have not been sleeping, i have been late for work and I have been unprepared many times. I am glad that the last day is this Thursday. i will have a month to 'detox'. I need it.

"I have been so depressed over a lost friendship. I have known this girl for about 5 years. We were very close or so I thought. We both had boys around the same age, went on vacations together with our families, and both went through our 2nd pregnancy together. I knew she was a person that had to have things her way but I accepted this. She has a large circle of friends that she included me in. I felt her family was mine, in a way. I am very shy and came out of my shell. Last year I got caught up with 2 other friends that were having problems. They really needed me. So I wasn't around much but I am always available if she needed me. Anyway, we got into a misunderstanding over something very minor. I really didn't think much about it the next day. That is the way I am. I get mad then I am over it within 24 hours. She is not like that. She holds grudges. I saw her the next day (4th of July) at her house. I knew she didn't really talk to me but she did have a lot of people there. Well,a couple of weeks after I call her saying ""Hey girl, can I pick land on up?"". She said ""How can you call and act like nothing is wrong?"" Then she hangs up on me. I wait until the next day and called again. First thing she says is ""What do you want?"" I say ""Just to be your friend."" She says ""We are no longer friends. There will be no more double dating with our husbands, vacations, you are to not come to my house, We are not friends"". I was blown away. I asked what I did and she couldn't give me a direct answer. She said we had different friends and I had more drama than any of her friends of 20 years. I asked her what drama? Last year I had some problems with my husband but I didn't really talk to her about that. She said  that was a problem, I didn't tell her things and that is what friends do. WHAT? She was contradicting herself. She hung up on me again.  It is very difficult for me because when I make a friend and let them into my heart they are my friend for life. Her son is my son's best friend and her husband is my husbands best friend. I had recently told my husband to not mention their names around me because I become really depressed. My poor son doesn't understand why she doesn't like me anymore. How can I explain when I don't know. I bought her daughter a shirt about a month ago and she didn't acknowledge it until she saw me in Walmart a week later and we were face to face and she thanked me. It was very weird. I haven't seen her since July. I can't let my son have his friend over anymore because it hurts too much to see him and know that I am not welcomed in their home and they haven't asked my son over their house since all of this even though he still came over ours. I can't figure out what I did that was so bad. I wish I knew so that maybe I could at least defend myself and have some closure.

"My purpose for posting this is that I'm at a dead end and don't know where else to turn. I'm 39 and I'm sure have been suffering from depression most my whole life. My life has been one failure after another, in relationships, jobs, and anything else. I had been on antidepressants for about 10 years and then stopped after I got arrested for a DUI and felony hit and run. The man who was injured received a cut on his face after chasing after me when I split the scene, that was the whole extent of his injuries. After the arrest I was feeling so bad it made no difference whether I took them or not. The charges were dropped but I had to wait day after day for a year or more just waiting for them to recharge me, which my attorney was sure they were going to do. That was 2 years ago and I think the experience did some very serious and real damage to me. I just lost my job in my probationary period of 2 months. I have worked so hard to create some kind of financial security for myself (BA in Psychology, technical degree in computers, numerous computer certifications) but where ever I go I don't fit in to the group and find myself alienated and let go. Some many failed romantic relationships, never having friends, and what family members I have are abusive and are incapable of providing healthy support. Most nights I calm myself enough to fall asleep by fantasizing about killing myself and the relief that was provide. I feel like a freak physically.

"Is it better to find out your love was a lie, or never to have loved at all? Last year, after 16 years of marriage, my wife says she never loved me, has never found me attractive (who can blame her), and doesn't think we've ever been right for each other. She only married me because she felt pressured from family and church to get married, and I was a ""good guy"", as she puts it. This crushed me. She has been everything to me. I have always loved her so much. My whole marriage has always been a fairy tale for me, it was everything I wanted. This was the girl of my dreams. I remember thinking when we were dating that it was too good to be true that any girl, especially one as amazing as my wife, would ever like me, since I'm shy, boring, and ugly. I guess I was right, it was too good to be true, and I should have trusted my gut and known it back then.  After a year of trying to find ways to connect with her, make myself more attractive to her, and hoping she'd love me, I've finally accepted that she never will. We are staying together for the kid's sake, and really for mine, what else would I do, no one else could ever love me, and I doubt I could ever really love anyone else the way I loved my wife. I've accepted that I will never have love. It makes me wonder, is it better to have thought I had love, and enjoyed it, only to find out it was lie, or never to have loved at all. At this point I really don't know.",better love lie loved all year year marriage wife say loved me attractive who blame her doe not think right other married felt pressured family church married good guy put it crushed me me loved much marriage fairy tale me wanted girl dream remember thinking dating good true girl especially amazing wife like me shy boring ugly guess right good true trusted gut known then year trying way connect her make attractive her hoping love me finally accepted will staying kid sake really mine do love me doubt really love way loved wife accepted love make wonder better thought love enjoyed it lie loved all point really not know,0.31396475434303284,0.17068788409233093,0.3662668764591217
"My Fictional Home    I stared outside, and watched the cold atmosphere awake me. The sun’s rays blocked by the magnificent beauty above us all; an urban scape filling my view around me. I felt a grave sadness strike all in the same spots for my daily routine, crippling what was left of my head. I grabbed the bicycle, and went along the path to any good in my life.     ‘A nearly missed accident up ahead,’ I reminded myself. I hit the button to change colors, and awaited a stop that could mean a sour tardiness or a decent morning. The color changed fast, and I hastily sped across the lines between me and the other side. I arrived, striking the pavement at full speed ahead down the rubber sidewalk.     A straight path to follow, a new future to envelop soon enough. The fact of the matter was that I had to pray to a god I didn’t believe in if I wanted to warp my happy spirit to glorious utopia. Logic overrides hearts quite rarely, leaving a snowflake and a shock of noise behind the mind that just wants it all to change. My bored mind only somewhat consciously bobbed his head around from side to side, keeping an eye on the reflective sign for a change of heart.     The observant man coming by on a bicycle or on his own two legs could notice the hurting expression that shone on my face. An insomnia that has outlasted its course, half a heart to spare to the one it belongs to, and the tonnes lying on his stubby shoulders. Whether the man is out to care for their dog, the mail, something; they always take a look to glance at the face of a broken child, often not realizing the fine details in the street lights glowing on my frozen cheeks.     ‘What did it take to find redemption?’ I often wondered, as grand sunlight was walking upstairs to knock the moon off it’s sleepy stool. I sat and watched a beautiful red giant approach, and drew images in mind to flicker about and echo in my concave dome of secrets. As the flickering opportunity ran full speed in front of me, I turned and felt the imagery toss into the incinerator. A great insecurity washed over the industry working ahead up above, slowing me down as I walked in slowly toward the place to call work.     I sat the bicycle at it’s rack, hands in pocket as I blinked at the glaring sun. A numbness hit my heart, and for the next eight hours, I’d lose who I was, only coming back at the rise of a pounding rain. I walked from a distant building, taking the long path to a home that didn’t know me. I took the rugged bicycle, and stared up above at the shadowy clouds.     I leaned forward over the handlebars, watching the patterns fly past my visions. I lifted up again, opening my voice to play a tune, looking for a face to redeem my little work. I went onward, and stared at the home that forgot me. I walked slowly up, placing the bicycle just where it was, hitting the kickstand which had sacrificed my ankle some.     I opened the door, giving a brief greeting. I entered the meeting room of regrets and lost innocence, stroking my hands over what was a cuddly friend. My vision blurred, feeling the great exhaustion from the night prior taking me over. I curled in the corner, feeling the toilets flushing the pent up pains from an earlier disembarkment of a peanut gallery. I hugged the one thing that brought a soothing to my life, and proceeded to let out an ugly sob, trying to remember who everyone was, as I grabbed a broken mirror, staring at who the blurry stranger was in it.     I felt myself faint, awaking to two strangers cycling the door between storage and the hands of all waiting for me. “What were you thinking?” the woman asked, “What did you say?” the man asking. “I don’t know.” I responded, lying on my side, as they both awkwardly stepped out, with a cracked expression of what was me walking out. I felt a blankness ride across my body, as I stared upon a wall that reminded me of life.     I sat stationary, and buried my head under a recording of a person with nothing left. I held my heart, staring out at the dark that I wanted to escape in. A length that no person dared, but a low that felt necessary. I felt an unnecessary realism flow through me, as my arms folded, feeling a coldness drip down my neck.     I got up, and went to the porch of attempting life again. A moon vanished above me, showing a pine away from me only just by some measurements. The bicycle appeared broken on the road, as I walked to what I remember being the last resort in this world. I walked to a reused bench, and stared out at the murky waters that felt like memories. I looked to my left, seeing a young boy sitting in the back of a delinquent’s wagon, and to my right a child amongst a smaller group, enjoying the finer delicacies of life. In between it all, a fool.     I cracked my bubbly back, as a soreness hit my veins. I stood slowly, my body tossing and turning inside. The world turned askew, as the sun beat slowly onto my flustered body. I took flight across the ramp of a broken dream, taking a flip that would ruin me for a day. A nostalgia for the life that was simple broke me down slowly, as I felt my walking slow down. I sat by a curb, watching a teenager go away from a regretful sunset on a bench. He sported a terrible frown, forgetting of the one. A light flew by at fast speeds, turning away from my stretched out legs, as a noise emitted from it’s front.     I stared blankly into the street, feeling my mind shatter into many jagged pieces. A dam blocked the feeling of humanity and a progress of going up in the world. I picked up the pieces, attaching them to my hurting consciousness. I stomped back to a filthy bed, staring into the bright light that fueled no purpose. I spread a message, the bait missing all parties.     I collapsed, waking to a time of no reply. I logged into what made time fly by, and felt the pains of months wash away within seconds. A second half had joined, and I forgot about all the things around me for the next year. Dawn upon myself shined my sleepy public works to let out a shrieking cry, standing over a bin full of scraps and desperation to fix my bleeding innards. I panicked into a corner, awaiting life’s worst terrors. I stood to nothing, and returned to a hamper of depression. I stared at the dusty fan blades fly full speed, breathing in only to glance at the horrid truth.     A shadow stood behind my forgotten figure, taunting the fullness above it. I wore a jacket and yelled at it, and it shyly walked. I took a deep breath and walked outside toward the bench once again, staring out at the beautiful waters. A creature came from the waters, approaching me. I held its hand, standing up accordingly. The creature pushed me into a pit full of spikes, as I awoke to half of me missing. I felt a burning inside of me, as my insides waned into a fine drawing of genitalia, washing the deliberate feeling and thought around my head, causing me to let out of a horrific screech of losing a natural ability.     My body awoke in a new person’s home, as I stared out into the busy road below my sleepy figure. An old woman came out from the corner, as I nervously responded with a gulp. We shared an exchange, as I sat and pondered the shelves of a life that I knew little about. I explored the past, only finding multiple recordings of enthusiasts. I folded my hands, recognizing that I meant nothing here.     The plane flew slowly away, as the shock went away from my skull, as my heart was left with a small hole. I sat and could not breathe, only feeling a great pain as we jumped into the chair of obnoxious actions. I sat and thought, glancing at the broken mirror. It was me.",fictional home stared outside watched cold atmosphere awake me sun ray blocked magnificent beauty all urban scape filling view me felt grave sadness strike spot daily routine crippling left head grabbed bicycle went path good life a nearly missed accident ahead reminded myself hit button change color awaited stop mean sour tardiness decent morning color changed fast hastily sped line side arrived striking pavement speed ahead rubber sidewalk straight path follow new future envelop soon enough fact matter pray god did not believe wanted warp happy spirit glorious utopia logic override heart quite rarely leaving snowflake shock noise mind just want change bored mind somewhat consciously bobbed head side keeping eye reflective sign change heart observant man coming bicycle leg notice hurting expression shone face insomnia outlasted course half heart spare belongs to tonne lying stubby shoulder man care dog mail something look glance face broken child not realizing fine detail street light glowing frozen cheek what did redemption wondered grand sunlight walking upstairs knock moon sleepy stool sat watched beautiful red giant approach drew image mind flicker echo concave dome secret flickering opportunity ran speed me turned felt imagery toss incinerator great insecurity washed industry working ahead above slowing walked slowly place work sat bicycle rack hand pocket blinked glaring sun numbness hit heart hour lose wa coming rise pounding rain walked distant building taking long path home did not know me took rugged bicycle stared shadowy cloud leaned forward handlebar watching pattern fly past vision lifted again opening voice play tune looking face redeem little work went onward stared home forgot me walked slowly up placing bicycle just wa hitting kickstand sacrificed ankle some opened door giving brief greeting entered meeting room regret lost innocence stroking hand cuddly friend vision blurred feeling great exhaustion night prior taking over curled corner feeling toilet flushing pent pain earlier disembarkment peanut gallery hugged thing brought soothing life proceeded let ugly sob trying remember wa grabbed broken mirror staring blurry stranger it felt faint awaking stranger cycling door storage hand waiting me thinking woman asked did say man asking not know responded lying side awkwardly stepped out cracked expression walking out felt blankness ride body stared wall reminded life sat stationary buried head recording person left held heart staring dark wanted escape in length person dared low felt necessary felt unnecessary realism flow me arm folded feeling coldness drip neck got up went porch attempting life again moon vanished me showing pine away just measurement bicycle appeared broken road walked remember resort world walked reused bench stared murky water felt like memory looked left seeing young boy sitting delinquent wagon right child smaller group enjoying finer delicacy life all fool cracked bubbly back soreness hit vein stood slowly body tossing turning inside world turned askew sun beat slowly flustered body took flight ramp broken dream taking flip ruin day nostalgia life simple broke slowly felt walking slow down sat curb watching teenager away regretful sunset bench sported terrible frown forgetting one light flew fast speed turning away stretched leg noise emitted front stared blankly street feeling mind shatter jagged piece dam blocked feeling humanity progress going world picked piece attaching hurting consciousness stomped filthy bed staring bright light fueled purpose spread message bait missing party collapsed waking time reply logged time fly by felt pain month wash away second second half joined forgot thing year dawn shined sleepy public work let shrieking cry standing bin scrap desperation fix bleeding innards panicked corner awaiting life worst terror stood nothing returned hamper depression stared dusty fan blade fly speed breathing glance horrid truth shadow stood forgotten figure taunting fullness it wore jacket yelled it shyly walked took deep breath walked outside bench again staring beautiful water creature came water approaching me held hand standing accordingly creature pushed pit spike awoke half missing felt burning inside me inside waned fine drawing genitalia washing deliberate feeling thought head causing let horrific screech losing natural ability body awoke new person home stared busy road sleepy figure old woman came corner nervously responded gulp shared exchange sat pondered shelf life knew little about explored past finding multiple recording enthusiast folded hand recognizing meant here plane flew slowly away shock went away skull heart left small hole sat not breathe feeling great pain jumped chair obnoxious action sat thought glancing broken mirror me,0.5140838027000427,0.4013579785823822,0.4578625559806824
"I'm sitting here at what is my 26th or 27th job (I can barely keep count. I'm 27 years old by the way). I already hate it and I've been here one month today. I don't think it's normal to have this many jobs over a lifetime, let alone when you're just in your late 20's. I've applied for disability before but was denied. I don't dispute the fact that I can get a job, I just can't keep a job. I get bored, I get anxiety attacks, I get to the point where I don't want to go outside at all. I'll never be able to work (successfully) with all those things going on. When I went to see an attorney to appeal my disability decision, he said I should find a job with minimal responsibility. What kind of job is that? Don't you have to be responsible enough to at least come to work (and on time)? Don't you have to be responsible to follow the rules of the job? I can't seem to do either one. Each job I get, I think ""maybe this can be the job I can stay at"" and it never happens. The longest I've ever stayed at a job is 1 year. I just feel like such a loser. Everyone I know always says they'll do whatever kind of job for their kids, or I should be lucky to have a job. I can see their point, but when I feel so miserable I can't see past that. I drag myself to jobs only to end up quitting or getting myself fired. What's wrong with me? Any advice?

" Hi, everyone - new to these forum board thingies so please forgive me if this does not end up being posted in the right place! I have lived with depression since I was 14 years old (I am now 43). For the past 10 years I have been managing this condition without the aid of drugs or stimulants. My life changed the day I stopped fighting the ""condition"" and accepted it as part of who I was. Acceptance is the greatest gift you can give yourself on the road to recovery, not only does it take away the stigma, it also gives the fear nothing to feed on. For those of you who are still in the depths of darkness, please don't give up hope, there are many of us out here who, have experienced exactly what you are going through now, we survived - so can you. Recovery is possible, it just takes time and a little faith in yourself. Thank you for allowing me to join this community, I hope my experiences of living with this condition can help others, the door to the email box is always open!

"Lonely and stupid. I feel so stupid.   I've always been academic and studious- if anything, I've dedicated my existence to the pursuit of knowledge, at the expense of forming human relationships. But I'm constantly overwhelmed by how much I don't know, how slow I am to understand concepts, and how my peers are all more intelligent than me. I know it's impossible to always be the smartest person in the room, but I feel that the fruits of my studies are disproportionate to my efforts.   At the same time, I have conflicting feelings over my loneliness. I desire human interaction, but others find me rigid and distant. In all honesty, I'm easily bored by small talk and trivial discussions. I understand that it's important in forming friendships, but my under-stimulated brain seems to automatically 'shut-off' after a while.   I've noticed that the people I do get along with are like me. Introverted, cold, and academic. We do not see each other as people, but as enlightened books with fresh concepts. These ideas are interesting to explore. If the book is lost, we are disappointed but not crushed. We were never bound by friendship; we were tied by our interests and perhaps mutual isolation. I don't feel an ounce of human warmth from these acquaintances.

"I think i'm okay, but in reality and in hindsight I am completely not okay. I think I am literally dying day by day. Hello to anyone out there,  I'm just a good guy who didn't come from much and I'm trying my best to live a fulfilling life but I don't think I can anymore because of this illness. I use to be quite a geek as a kid and love video games and playing with others and having fun. I remember when I use to look forward to coming home from elementary school or middle school and just do my homework and then game away. It was so much fun then and I felt like I was genuinely pretty happy. Now a days I feel like i'm just literally dead. I don't do anything, I can't sleep, I hardly eat because I cant find the motivation to go out and get food... and over the past 4 years I have noticed that depression really has taken a toll on me mentally and physically.  It sucks so bad that I genuinely think I will probably die prematurely and die lonely. I have no friends, no acquaintances, and just family that don't understand anything about what i'm going through. To be honest I wish I was never born. I wish i didn't exist because facing the world is killing me.  Just the other day I thought about all the opportunities i've missed out on because of my depression. Like internships, jobs, career fairs, fun events and even a potential awesome friend but all of that isn't going to happen because i am as dead as a rock.  I turned 22 a couple days ago and no one even said happy birthday...Not even family. At this point i'm looking at my future and its looking dim.  I've simply lost the meaning of living. I have no self esteem, no confidence, nothing. Maybe people like me don't deserve to live a good life, perhaps we ought to die and just get over it.  If there was someone who can tell me my fate i'll want to listen to it now. I just can't anymore. I fucking just want to run the bridge and jump off but sadly i recognize that I only have one life. I'm hoping and hoping maybe everything can turn around for me but what are the odds to be honest.  I might as well have a heart attack and just die. I hate this. I'm lonely, i'm always sad and i'm just a piece of shit that is worthless.  Good Bye everyone. I hope you've all had an awesome day. As for me everyday is the same and if things don't change soon I think i'll rather end it. Not even graduating college meant anything for me. I fucking hate myself!

"I feel doubts about my relationship when I'm depressed? I'm 25/M. I'm gay and I've been with my boyfriend J for five months.  I used to be severely depressed. But lately my life has been pretty good. But sometimes I get into a depressed mood and I start having doubts about my relationship.  Honestly nothing is really wrong between us. But sometimes I feel like I don't really love him, and that we don't actually have any chemistry. And I don't know why I feel that way. I start nitpicking our relationship and try to find flaws in it to justify how I feel.  But other times we'll both be in a good mood, and the spark is totally there, and I feel great about everything.  I'm starting to think that this is just what my brain defaults to when I'm sad, and that there's nothing actually wrong with us. For example this weekend I was feeling great, then on Sunday my parents had a conversation with me that really triggered me, and now I'm feeling depressed and doubting my relationship. (The conversation with my parents had nothing to do with my boyfriend.)  Basically it seems like whenever I feel down, my brain immediately jumps to ""maybe I should break up with my boyfriend."" I don't know if this is a sign that something is actually wrong, or if this is just what a depressed brain does.   Does anyone else experience this? Is this common?

As a result of that, I feel nothing from the hobbies or moments that would before provide me feelings of joy, satisfaction or just generally fulfilling myself. The only activities I really ""enjoy"" anymore is anything that provides me with a complete escape from reality, however these activities are not exactly one belonging to a healthy lifestyle.  I just want to enjoy the things that I used to enjoy, but whenever I try I feel like I am wasting my time, are not doing them well enough. Has anybody gone through something similar, and has advice for how they managed to get through it?  Thanks for reading.",advice getting touch everyday life think hardest thing me largest factor need address try feel healthy again simply trying feel engaged enjoying present right now day little meaning all really able think life term week month year result that feel hobby moment provide feeling joy satisfaction just generally fulfilling myself activity really enjoy anymore provides complete escape reality activity not exactly belonging healthy lifestyle just want enjoy thing used enjoy try feel like wasting time not doing enough anybody gone similar advice managed it thanks reading,0.35579371452331543,0.3696224093437195,0.4475030303001404
"Thank You ArtChick and Tempesta , all of you who have been here for me. I'm so glad that you all understand. I really want to get out from behind this trapped door. My life is so controlled and he doesn't even see it. He denies it when i bring it up. I cry because i can't buy things for my children or grandchildren. This isn't the way it is suppose to be. One of the reasons I don't make it to church on some Sundays is because I don't have clothes to wear. I have a pair of black jeans i keep switching jackets and shirts so i don't look the same every Sunday. My daughter bought me a nice dress and it was warm enough last Sunday to wear it. I guess i shouldn't care about what people think and all the people at my church are wonderful, not judgmental. I do go to the Lord in Prayer every morning and study my Bible. I feel content because we are supposed to give all our worries to him and not get in his way of taking care of them. I know God is working in my life, my daughter finding this site is just one of the ways i know. my husband just got a job after being out of work for a year. I prayed for that too. He didn't just get a job but he got a good job. I told him he didn't get it on his own. I know I am going to get better eventually. Thank all of you for being here for me.

"I suffer from major depression too and I have taken almost all of the SSRI's but the only one that really helped me was Lexapro. I took it for around 2 month's, then decided that I didn't want to become addicted to another medication so I just stopped taking it and it didn't bother me at all. I have been taking 100 mil of Elavil at bedtime which is also an antidepressant but I take it to help me sleep. It used to help control my depression but it doesn't anymore and really doesn't help me sleep either. Have you ever tried Lexapro? I think it's the best SSRI one can be on and I had no side effects while taking it so you might want to ask your doctor about it. If there is an alternative treatment for major depression I would like to know what it is. I really have no reason to be depressed as I have a very loving, supportive husband 4 wonderful children, 10 grandchildren and 6 great-grand children. Both my husband and I are retired and this is a time when I should really be enjoying my life but there is a void which I can't explain. I don't want for anything. I have a beautiful home, a new Durango but the material things aren't what makes one happy. I've been told that one chooses to be happy or unhappy but I certainly don't choose to be unhappy and I don't know anyone who would. I am a devout Christian and I know that my depression isn't coming from God but I'm letting the Devil tell me that I'm depressed. Maybe God is just trying to bring me closer to Him and I need to lay my burden of depression at His feet and tell him that I can't get through this alone, then just forget about it but for me it isn't that easy. Three of my 4 children are taking antidepressants so I guess depression might be hereditary (spelling?). I will pray for you to feel better and will you please pray for me too?

"Hello. I am just getting over a suicide attempt, my 2nd. It was extremely serious. I was planning it for week, and when I was fired form my job I did it the next day. I have a BS in chemistry and worked testing pharmacological products, so i knew what to take. I don't know what made me call my ex-BF. I did not speak to him for 4 months, but I wanted him to be the one to find me. Needless to say I lived. The doctors where surprised that I did. I took 3 things, (not going to give people ideas) that i knew they could not do anything for because of them being together. They could not pump my stomach cause of the one thing. They could not give any antidotes cause of interactions. I took well over the lethal limit. My life was spiraling out of control since Jan of 98. Since then, I have had 3 heart and 2 cancer operations. I was discharged from the Navy, was an officer, because of the medical stuff. My 1st suicide attempt was in the navy, they chalked it up to being stupid and not dealing with the 1st heart and cancer surgeries. My parents had a bitter divorce and I was caught in the middle when I got home. My mother assumed my ID and ran up a bunch of bills. I came out of the closet. I slept around to feel wanted. Which was not a wise choice, I gained my 3rd major medical situation. Not going to say what, but I am sure you can figure it out. I have a soul mate that I hurt, my ex-BF, and who knows if we will ever be friends or more. 2005 was a blur. I do not remember things, or saw things that where not there. Like documentation, which led to me being fired. I was afraid to leave the house, and was even afraid of 5 year olds selling candy for the school. The good thing about the suicide attempt is there was a proper diagnosis. I compartmentalized, and pushed emotions away. Every situation or moment had its own little box, and I put it away. I wanted to be like Spok or Data. I would put on different mask for different situations. There was shopping me, gas pumping me, heck, i had a separate mask for every action I performed. I have abandonment issues, from how i was treated growing up. Medicines did nothing and gave bad side effects. My depression is not chemical, but mental. I need to re-learn how to think and handle emotions and issues properly. Unemployment is running out, people are looking for money for bills. But it is better to be alive. WOW, this was longer than I intended.

"My best friend’s husband shot himself friday night. I’m angry. He was a manly man. All of us. All of his friends encouraged him to get help but he grew up in a world, in a house, that thought mental health professionals were quacks. He thought that taking medicine for something going on in your head was weak. This was an entirely medical problem that could have been prevented. So I’m mad. At him for leaving my best friend a 26 year old widow, at the people who raised him, at society, for telling him it’s weak to take medicine, at whatever the fuck higher power may be responsible for this stupid, senseless waste. I’m guilty for not trying to do more. I’m heartbroken that I’ll never talk to him again or hear him play his guitar or see him turn a piece of wood into something beautiful.

"I had therapy today. I don't even know where to start. First off, I lost a day last week (time loss/dissociation)...it was last Tuesday that I lost. My mom called me Friday and I said ""why are you calling me"" and she said ""I always call you on Friday"". I told her that it was Thursday and she told me I was wrong. So, I back tracked the best I could and I can't remember anything that I did on Tuesday. The interesting thing is that I mailed my therapist the research info I found on dissociation so when I saw her today I asked her what was the date that I put on the letter I sent and guess what...IT WAS TUESDAY. Then she asked me if I brought it in and I told her no that I mailed it. And she said that I couldn't have because it wasn't scanned by the post office. She showed me the envelope and it wasn't scanned at all. She also said that the mail had already come in the office and the envelope was in her mailbox way after she had already checked her mail. So, we have no idea how that got to her office. But I don't drive and Carol didn't take me anywhere last week. So, if anyone remembers being with me or talking to me Tuesday...COULD YOU HELP ME OUT PLEASE. My therapist looked over the information that I sent her and she said that everything basically fits with what I'm going through and DID. The problem is, she doesn't treat dissociative disorders and has no idea how to even help me. I appreciated her honesty though. But she said she knows a therapist in Jeffersonville, IN...oh God...that treats dissociative patients but I don't drive and Carol's not going to take me over to Jville on a weekly basis for therapy. Also, we've never even been over there before so we'd get lost. So, she then called her boss and another lady to see if they knew who else in Louisville could help me and to see if she can get some help on treating me. I also gave her more info on some of the things I'm dealing with and the voices that are going on. I even gave her the names of the two that I already know of. She said the fact that I can't remember my childhood and that I not only lose time for minutes but also for days that it isn't normal and we need to figure out how to help me. I've been in the mental health system since 2001 and have had just about every diagnosis slapped on me. I hope I can finally get some help. I'm honestly about to give up. She also said that she's going to see if they can take me off the Seroquel since it's making me sick and NOT WORKING. So, she asked me what else I've been on and I told her (Haldol - didn't work, Risperdal - didn't work, Zyprexa - didn't work, Paxil/Paxil CR - worked for a little bit then wore off, Wellbutrin - didn't work). She said that she wants to try Depakote, Abilify, or another mood stabilizer. I also took those two journal entries in that I posted last week so she could read them. And, I wish I could get it scanned but it didn't look right to me so I can't show them to you (that's why I just typed it) and she said that one of the interesting things that stood out about the entries is that the handwriting was different in three places. I'm a mess. But believe it or not, after today's session I am a little hopeful. In other news, Carol and I have started working on our book of poetry. We've been throwing around ideas all day and working out some details. We're in the process of getting the poems we want to be in the book together and coming up with a title (which we have already done). We're also working on the different categories that we want the poems to fall under. I've been working around with PagePlus for a couple of hours now trying to figure out how we can set this up. She also has a list of publishers that we're going to be going through as well. I'm also still working on getting around to doing some updates on my webpage and trying to budget out how I can pay for my site so I can get more space and get rid of those damn banner ads.

"I take it that by you saying ""Learn to give rather than take and you will find life turns around!"" that you're implying that I'm a taker and not a giver. And maybe that's so.

"Okay, here's the deal. I'm 17, and I have been depressed and suicidal for as long as i can remember. (See the post ""God Hates Me"") I just want to die. I hate living. It feels like no one cares. In order to combat my depression I write. To date I have written four major writings (50,000- 200  pages -  words or more) and am on my fifth. Last year, when I was on my first major writing one of my friends asked me if she could read it. I was hesitant because it's my soul. I take everything I feel and put it down on the page. It's all I do. i don't go out or have any kind of social life. Writing is my life.  But, I eventually let her read it. She liked it and read that whole writing. Since then she has become my editor of sorts. There's just one problem - she's not editing.  You see, she's a drama geek - in plays and everything - and doesn't have a whole lot of free time so I understand a slow pace, but lately I've had to prod her to do anything. Even over Christmas break she didn't do anything. Now, I have to call her on the weekends (which is the only time she'll even do it now) to get her to do anything. If I don't she'll forget she even has it. Every time I ask her about it, she just tells me how busy she is and I end up feeling guilty. I feel like she's rejecting me as a person, like she's saying ""i just don't care about you."" It hurts me so bad. It makes me feel like the one thing keeping me alive is stupid. It makes me want to kill myself. I feel like it's a burden to her. It hurts me so bad. It makes me go home and cut myself. I have no idea how to handle the situation. I want her to do it, but I don't want it to seem like i'm pestering her. I understand she's busy, but she makes time to go out with her other friends. Couldn't she make a little time for me?

Does anyone else's depression causes them to constantly daydream or imagine their lives are a documentary? I daydream a lot about people I know in real life or situations I wish would happen.

"I wish people that have never experienced depression could still understand. There are those who might really care about you and want to help but they have zero clue how depression works and their mindset is basically to tell you to get over it because that's what they do. It's so fucking shit. I should be grateful I have people that care about me I know, but its genuinely not that helpful when they brush aside how shit I really feel because they don't see a reason for me to feel like this other than just being weak. It's not even their fault it's just actually uncomprehendable to some people that you would rather not exist sometimes for reasons beyond your control.

"Getting motivated to get help I was diagnosed with a mood disorder and PTSD ~1.5 years ago. I was getting help for a while but I dropped out of school and moved out of state so I just haven't been able to do that in the past year. I live with (and mooch off of) an SO but I've been fairly isolated for about 6 months. I've been doing online school but had to drop my classes this semester when I started working. Now all I do is this stupid part-time job. I should probably quit because it makes me incredibly suicidal. It's all so superficial. It doesn't feel beneath me but I really just don't mesh with it.   Anyway. Health insurance. I can't figure out how to fill out the income stuff. A hospital near me has people that can help but I just can't find the motivation to even call them. It's like I'm trying to prevent myself from getting help. It's not even just psychiatric reasons that I want health insurance. I have a referral for a neurologist. I've been having memory issues, twitches, etc. I know I won't go without insurance. I probably could stand to get on birth control and check out some other persistent problems too but a) I know I won't be taken seriously and b) the only thing I genuinely like about myself is my mind so that's the priority.  I'm not completely not trying. I'll take St. John's Wort if I'm persistently suicidal but it doesn't help with motivation. I've been going to support groups. I'll ""decide"" to be motivated but end up collapsed and sobbing before I get out of the door. Play music, leave my phone behind so I don't get sidetracked. Tell people what I'm doing so I feel pressured to keep my word. Incentivize with promises of fast food, caffeine, or chocolate. I dunno what else to do. I can't even tell if it's laziness or depression or something else.

"A Letter to My Future Self: Self Love Dear (future) B,  This letter may be fragmented.  This letter may be short, or it may be long.   This letter may be emotional.   Most importantly, this letter is to show you that you can stay grounded despite the rush of emotions you experience when you feel vulnerable and [falsely] unloved.   Everything you thought you knew since that day (October 21st) has become unraveled within the last fourteen hours. It’s hard to find the words that can sum it all up in order to save some time and space within this letter. This letter is also not about those specific events but about you and only you, and how far you’ve come; it all plays into being able to deal with whatever the future may bring.   As you admitted this morning, to yourself and G, your sense of clarity evaporates when you begin to feel vulnerable. It leads you to a self-fulfilling prophecy - the exact neediness you exhibit will do the exact opposite of what you’d like it to do and will therefore lead you to feeling ever more “needy.”   Listen to me: You are not validated by someone’s ability (or lack thereof) to love you.   And again: Sometimes, it is not simply not about you.   So far in your healing process you’ve managed to understand the importance of detachment. You’re making wonderful progress and I hope that at some point you are still progressing. Your existence is for you and for you only. It is not okay or healthy to live solely for another human being. Remember that you are not “incomplete” without someone however that someone can enhance the you that you already are. A relationship consists of two people working together as a whole yet existing as their own sense of “wholeness” outside of the relationship. That is so very important for you to remember for the rest of your life. Remember when you felt vulnerable just a few weeks ago (sometime in November) and wanted to dive into texting that boy in order to make you feel better about yourself? And then remember that you didn’t because you kept your clarity and understood that it was a coping mechanism. Don’t forget that you’ve done that not only once but a few times now and that is exceptional. I understand future Bri may encounter some setbacks and that her well-being might as well be a roulette wheel, but that’s exactly what this letter is for.   As you’ve been told, you are luminous. You shine bright. Your heart is [almost too] huge. You have the potential to do great things. You are not your illness and you are not your insecurities. The grave you will lay in one day will only consist of you and nobody else. If the world ends and you survive, you have yourself. You have to keep this mind every single day. Work on self love and understand your worth. Yes, G makes you feel like the most important girl in the world. But before you can let him do that, you need to understand that you are the most important girl in the world to yourself, for yourself.   You’re done putting your interests aside just to receive love for the night/day. You’re done with getting angry at the phone for not getting responses quickly. You’re done feeling unimportant or unloved because you’re not someone’s first priority. In the month and a half since the breakup, you have transformed. It is only the beginning but you have taken steps in the right direction. Future B needs to look back on this whether she’s in a good spot at the time or not. She needs to know that even though she may not be at a point in life she envisioned, she did something for herself.   When you feel like he’s pulling away, don’t push harder.   When you feel like you want to run to him in order to silence your overwhelmingly surfacing insecurities, understand that will not make things better. Understand that they are amplified and you are only expressing coping mechanisms in order to deal with the underlying issue. The issue isn’t that he doesn’t love you but that you make yourself unloveable. Understand that when you get into that mindset and lose grasp of the clarity, someone moving mountains for you will not fill that hole of pain. The only person on the face of this Earth that can fill that hole is you. You have the capability of moving mountains on your own when you remember these things.   Continue doing your research. Continue taking time for yourself. Continue setting your phone down for hours at a time. Continue living your life out and letting others play a part and not the center role. You’re the star of your life, you lead the show. Your family, friends, boyfriend, colleagues - they play their roles in your story. Most importantly, they play their lead role in their own stories and similarly you are character.   Learn to appreciate silence. Learn to appreciate a bit of loneliness and solitude. Self-love includes coming home from work to take a hot bath and drink a glass of red wine, not rushing over to whoevers house in order to feel loved by someone else.   You cannot be loved appropriately if you cannot love yourself first.    Isn’t it just like me to start taking the advice I’ve been given by so many people my entire life.   Love yourself. Respect yourself. Appreciate your own time. Respect others. Respect other’s need for space.  Live for you. Again, love yourself.    With love, B, 12/3/2017.

"I kinda like being depressed after dealing with anxiety As a lot of people, I have both depression and anxiety disorders.   Basically a thing happened in July, which caused me to have constant panic attacks and overall brutal anxiety until around October, when I just transitioned into deep depression. It was however a big relief. I was completely empty, I didn't care about anything. It was 100x better to me than fucking anxiety. When I'm depressed, I don't feel 'bad'. I don't feel good either, but I'm fine with that. I don't feel anything, it's kinda relaxing.  The downside - when I was in the deepest state of depression I was really close to killing myself and I also threatened to shoot up the school, after which police took me to a mental hospital. I've been here for over 3 months now. I did some really bad things, I acted really bad, but on the inside I felt better. When I'm anxious I don't do mean things to people, but on the inside I'm dying, I feel vulnerable and just want help.  I understand that depression is awful and people suffer from it, I see what it does to people on this sub. I just wanted to add my experience, since it's different to everyone else's.  Anxiety makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack, like I'm going crazy, I sweat, I shake, it feels literally like torture.  Depression is the exact opposite. It's calmness, not giving a shit about anything, basically relaxing. I feel kinda comfortable being depressed. I lie on the bed and look at the ceiling, at the wall, whatever. Like I'm on autopilot.  Right now I have both, which just feels fucking weird, I can't even describe that.  Sorry if I offended anyone. I know some people prefer to feel something, but I'm fine with being an empty shell.  tl;dr - depression &gt; anxiety for me.",kinda like depressed dealing anxiety lot people depression anxiety disorder basically thing happened july caused constant panic attack overall brutal anxiety october just transitioned deep depression big relief completely empty did not care anything x better fucking anxiety depressed not feel bad not feel good either fine that not feel anything kinda relaxing downside deepest state depression really close killing threatened shoot school police took mental hospital month now did really bad thing acted really bad inside felt better anxious not mean thing people inside dying feel vulnerable just want help understand depression awful people suffer it doe people sub just wanted add experience different is anxiety make feel like having heart attack like going crazy sweat shake feel literally like torture depression exact opposite calmness not giving shit anything basically relaxing feel kinda comfortable depressed lie bed look ceiling wall whatever like autopilot right both just feel fucking weird that sorry offended anyone know people prefer feel something fine shell tlr depression gt anxiety me,0.7724133133888245,0.4880203604698181,0.7483113408088684

Today though I decided to go to subway to get a melt and I was just standing in line when this girl walks away from her friend and up to me. I thought she was pretty and was nervous about why she was talking to me until she asked “Are you a serial killer?”  That’s when my heart sank.   I had just shaved and I realize I’m not the best looking guy in the world, but I didn’t know that’s how strangers perceived me. I kept a calm demeanor until I got back to my car and I just complete broke down and I was bawling all the way home.  I don’t know why it hurt so much, but I felt like complete shit.   I’m trying to not let it affect me and not hit a low point so I hope sharing this relieves me a little bit. I am nervous about sharing this though. I’m just shocked that someone could say that.

"Hello, I'm Yevgenny, 21 years old, and have suffered from depression for...well...I guess as long as I can remember. I started having suicidal thoughts when I was 9, but strangely enough, I can't remember having at that age any concept of suicide. I've been placed on practically all of the antidepressants over the years (with the exception of MAOIs), and am currently taking Cymbalta--no real side effects, seems effective enough. My father died when I was 18, but that in itself wasn't so sad. Last September, I had a sudden thought regarding my feelings about his death, and I found the most heartbreaking aspect was, like I said, not the fact that he died, but that the process of dying was for him degrading and humiliating. Like me, he was very independent--if he needed help with something, he considered himself defeated; he was content in his own world, like I am, but the magnitude of something like death forced people into his world...those intangible connections between ourselves and others, between him and others, seemed to chain him down. When I had my last breakdown in September, I couldn't stop myself from imagining it; to find yourself suddenly and wholly dependent on others, and for them to force themselves into your mind, your world, and find for themselves some memory or happy relic to take with them such that even your most private, perhaps sacred thoughts and memories are wrenched from you. I thought about what it must've been like to know with certainty that death was all that was left, the helplessness of not being able to face your own future without someone either doing it for you or having earlier robbed you of the existential will power to do it. I attempted to hang myself after my morning classes. I'm not sure how, but before kicking the chair away, I forced myself to call someone because the world is so huge, and I've only had the chance to see such a small part of it, to die then, would've been so meaningless and empty--the very things I was attempting to escape, meaninglessness and emptiness. The friend I called left work immediately and came to me. She cried in one afternoon more than I ever have, and she wasn't even the depressed one. So, fast forward to today. Did some inpatient care. I'm seeing a therapist whom I trust, respect, and have thus far been unable to outwit (it's a good thing.) On a physiological basis, the medication is helping. Psychologically however, I've got some work to do. Ignoring biological/chemical factors, in order for me to be happy, I need to find/build/understand the meaning of my life. I do not believe that man is born with an inherent raison d'etre, or that one is given to him by some divine entity; rather, I believe that the meaning of one's life is self-constructed and in continual flux, it is something you work on, something you subsist upon, and yet is something that is always just out of reach, or one brush stroke undone. Not an easy job. But last week I was on my front porch at around 4pm having a cigarette (I'm keeping this habit for now.) Everything was still, the air still cold with winter but with traces of spring on every tree, the clouds were lit from below and the west, it was like a painting; but it was this oddly static scene that gave me the most lucid understanding of myself, that unstoppable, dynamic thing we call self. And so, more than ever before, I'm going to take treatment seriously and honestly; even if there is sadness, those chance moments of serenity that make up for in intensity what they lack in length, in those instances I think I will find meaning, no, I already have, I suppose. I apologize for how lengthy this became, but I'm guessing it was somehow necessary for me to say. I'm looking forward to talking with the other members of the forum, as I don't think I've ever talked to others who were depressed. Even if I don't find much help here, there might be someone who finds such help in me. Thanks! And, again, I'll try to keep future posts shorter, but in my defense, sometimes when I write I don't feel in control...oh, starting to go off again.

"I don't know how to go about this. Hey. Im Tomm.  Ive had a fucking miserable time in the last 21 years. I havent been happy for the last 11 years and when i finally am happy and get into the swing of it, it fucks off and leaves me to suffer. Rant; for the last 10 years my dad has had cancer, hes not well at all. It seems im the only one who gives enough of a shit to help him. I wouldve moved away and had a life by now, but ive stayed purely for him. Last week i realised hes manipulating me to get anything he fucking wants. The girl ive been chasing for 6 months that i fell in love with has just fucked me off. Long story short about 3 months ago she had a 2 year anniversary with a guy but admitted she has a thing for me. So i waited it out and about 3 weeks ago they broke up so i thought 'hey, ill see if i can hang out with her and see what happens' nope. Told her i still feel how i did and she just says 'i see you as a friend and nothing more'. Maybe im just not cut out to be here, or to deal with people? Ive had a fucking terrible time, people to chat too would be nice.

"I don't feel well. Hey, I'm a highschool freshman and this has been the lowest I've ever been from the past three years of feeling like I should be gone. Buckle up your seatbelts because this'll probably be pretty long.  Since the beginning of this year, I've been wanting to die; I feel so lonely and as if nobody actually cares about me.  So, there's my primary friendship group; the people I hang out with the most. All of my (2) ""genuine"" female friends pretty much don't give two shits about me because I tend to act really clingy to them and other people because I've been friends with them since first grade and don't want to lose them. One of my female friends is kinda popular and she barely talks to me, and I just feel like I'm undeserving of her time or something; she's also kinda claimed my other female friend, so I don't get as much time to hang out with them as I used to. My guy friends are also a bit popular and they also happen to be dating my two female friends lol. They do make me feel happy talking to them, and I do hang out with them a lot, but sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be hanging out with them all that much because then I'm ""stealing"" them from my friends. I also get pretty bummed not being in a relationship when my other friends are, and I do feel like I'm not needed amongst any of my friends. (Basically, I just feel like the rebound when one of my friends aren't there).  Can we actually talk about one of my female friends a bit more, actually? We'll call her M and my other female friend B. We met M last year and we invited her to hang out with us during our lunches. M was going through a tough time and we helped her out all the time and it was great making a new really close friend. She was really fun to talk to, but I don't know...sometimes she says some shit to me that makes me kinda bummed. I remember telling her how I felt kinda depressed once, and she said something along the lines of ""Stop asking for attention and actually do something"". Another time, I was hanging out with B's boyfriend, but the next day, M was mad at me and told me I shouldn't take him from B (which I do get and feel bad for, but B is totally cool with it and understands how me and her boyfriend hang out :p) Recently, (I don't remember what initiated the conversation really) M and I were talking (which rarely happens anymore), and she was talking about how she feels like she doesn't have anyone that actually cares for her, when she has so many people that clearly do care about her and love her. Then she proceeds to tell me to actually go and make friends again. I hate being petty and talking about other people, but I just don't feel comfortable being very close to her anymore and I'm not sure she's interested in talking to me either.   So then that leaves like two male friends, and again because they're in relationships with B and M, I'm trying to pace myself with hanging out with them so one of them don't get upset. It's also pretty hard to make friends in a school where most people are white and really attractive, or already have their place. I'm a non-attractive Asian female that tends to make weird jokes and seem really masculine with the way that I mainly put forward, and I just don't fit in anywhere. I have a lot of anxiety of what people think of me, so then I sometimes struggle with talking to people. I wouldn't say people dislike me at all, it's just that nobody would hang out with me outside of school and it's hard to find people that are willing to spend time with me.  There's also the problem with others' expectations of me;; Almost all my life, I've been deemed ""smart"", which has caused so much pressure and anxiety throughout the years. My parents really want me to do well in school, and peers think I'm so great at everything. I *thought* it would go away after elementary school, but even here, people consider me being so ""smart"" and able to do anything. With currently a ~95 average in my classes, it's extremely difficult to maintain that and I feel like if I do any worse, someone is going to get mad at me. People expect me and think I'm so good, but really I'm just average at literally everything I do.  I also have no idea what I want to do with my life. I'm not very good at anything, and I have so many interests, it's hard to pin down something that I *should* do with my time. Nothing really interests me enough to do it for like 25~40 years of my life, and the things I would be interested in have literally no way of making a living off of or is something totally unachievable. I feel like I can't make any difference to anyone in the world, and I'll die not making an impression on anyone or having anyone really care about me in the end.  I've been hurting myself since about third grade, mostly from scratching myself with my nails until it leaves a mark for a few days and hitting myself on the back of the head. It's extremely satisfying and I feel like it's a good thing to punish myself for being such a waste. So that's pretty much the gist of it, I guess? Mostly just problems with self worth and having others view me a certain way. There is some other stuff, but nothing that I can really think of at the top of my head. These past 3 months have been excruciating, and I haven't gone a day without thinking I should just end it all and give up. I want to be happy, but that just seems so far away and I don't know if me living benefits anyone. Admittedly, I don't want to die, but I *do* at the same time? I feel like I have no place in the world and I can't talk to anyone about how I'm feeling because none of them are actually willing to hear what I have to say, so now I'm just dumping my feelings on Reddit. I'm tired of living and feeling like shit. I don't remember the last time I genuinely felt happy to be alive. I want someone I'm close to tell me that they love me and care about me and say I'm not a useless piece of garbage and that what I say isn't meaningless or invalid. I don't want to feel alone. I don't ask to feel alone. I feel alone because I am alone, and I feel like I can't tell anyone this because I don't want them to walk out of my life.  I'm sorry if this seemed really petty and like I'm just bitching about some shitty first world problems, because I know I am. :/ I just feel kinda down right now and I haven't been able to tell someone how I actually feel in months.   So yeah. Thanks for reading, stranger. Sorry for the inconvenient text wall.

"Hi! We are YourAmigo Hi!  I’m A.M. and I’m writing to introduce a new initiative named YourAmigo. Basically we are a group of friends that have to decided to form this initiative to help anyone who need an “amigo” (Spanish word for friend).

We want to hear your stories, we want you to tell us whatever you’d like to say. In the end we just want you to feel heard. And of course, you will never be judged.  You know guys, we have all been there, in that cold and lonely place. For some, this place will be terrifying and called depression, for others it might be something less severe. But we don’t care. If it is important enough for you to feel bad about it, then it would be an honor for us to hear about it.   Here’s how we work: below you have the email address where you can find us. Please write us. In your first email, you can tell us anything you want, though a little bit of your story is always welcomed (though not required!). And that’s it!

"Does anyone else miss the person they used to be? I've always struggled with depression, but sometimes it's more manageable than other times. I've noticed that with every new year and myself getting older, I begin to look back on my past and long for it, even sometimes breaking down because I miss the person I used to be.  I'm 23, so still young, but I really wish I could go back and be 19/20 again because that was when I was truly happy. I had moved out of my hometown, had lots of friends, a good relationship, I lost tons of weight and was confident for the first time ever, I traveled and worked for fun instead of working as a means of survival. I loved life, I had so much energy and such a bright outlook on everything and I had a lot of fun.  Now, that's all over. I really only have one good friend left from those times and he doesn't even live near me anymore; sometimes I get really down when I think about old friends and start thinking about things I could've said differently that might've prevented the arguments we had that would eventually lead to the end of our friendship, I really never knew how much I needed them until they no longer wanted me in their lives. My relationship fizzled out in the same way and I've yet to develop a connection like that with anyone again. I've also gained all my weight back and can't stand to look at my own reflection.  I don't know how to be happy like I was again. I look at old pictures from times past with old friends, destinations I went too and I want to cry because I just wish I could go back. I'm so depressed and hate myself, I'm incredibly lonely and am just a shell of the person I used to be. It's like I'm mourning my past life or something.",doe miss person used be struggled depression manageable time noticed new year getting older begin look past long it breaking miss person used be young really wish truly happy moved hometown lot friend good relationship lost ton weight confident time ever traveled worked fun instead working mean survival loved life energy bright outlook lot fun now over really good friend left time doe not live near anymore really think old friend start thinking thing said differently prevented argument eventually lead end friendship really knew needed longer wanted life relationship fizzled way develop connection like again gained weight stand look reflection not know happy like again look old picture time past old friend destination went want just wish back depressed hate myself incredibly lonely just shell person used be like mourning past life something,0.4352349638938904,0.47030484676361084,0.49811726808547974
"I made a word cloud of all my depressive posts over the past three years. https://i.imgur.com/hNbtyW4.png    This is based on all the posts on my throwaway account (this is my main account and has too many unrelated posts to sort through) since 2014.    I think it's noteworthy that some of the biggest words in the cloud are negative.    While going back over these posts from so relatively long ago, I noticed that most of the older ones seemed like they were written by a total stranger. If it were somebody else saying those things about me, it would be called harassment, but it was me saying those things about myself.  All in all, this has really made me realize that all the things I have written about myself are way off-base, and are only true in my mind during a depressive episode.    I know something's wrong, but I don't know what to do about it. In some ways I'm sure I'll always think this way about myself, regardless of what I do, but I wish there were an easy way to manage it.

"Psychiatrist of 6 years terminated me as a patient and is refusing refills of Lamictal because I went to outpatient rehab? I have been going to the same psychiatrist for 6 years.  I have been on a high dose of Lamictal for 6 years to treat bipolar disorder.  I have gone to regular appointments and have had consistent refills.  I had a period of intense depression in which I went on a one month drinking binge and went to a hospital where I was given Ativan to deal with the withdrawal.  It wasn't a consistent prescription, just enough pills to ween off the withdrawal and ensure I wouldn't relapse back to drinking.  My psychiatrist just called me and told me she is terminating me as a patient and is unable to see me or refill my lamictal because I was prescribed Ativan by another physician.

"Hi all, I am in hell of major depression. After being for over 8 years on Elavil and Valium(small dosage), with good results for most of the time, I tapered down because of the side effects and have been drug free for 1 year. During this year the depression slowly settled in making my life unbearable lately. I don't know what to do. I saw 2 psychiatrists within last month. One of them wanted me on Paxil and the second one on Effexor. Problem is I am so afraid of side effects that I can't begin taking any of them, meantime my life is falling to pieces. My nervous system was completely messed up by these medicines. I had severe fasciculation of muscles for over 4 months after being medicine free (sign of tardive dyskinesia, untreatable neurological condition) and get them back whenever I try any supplement that would increase serotonin level (SAMe, St. John's Wort, Rhodiola). My memory got better after I stopped the medication but now it's falling apart because of the depression I get de-realized I mean if depression won't kill me these medicines will. What are my alternatives (if any)? Shall I take these medicines, for the time being, endure side effects and expose myself to degenerative damage? Shall I stay away from medicines and get incapacitated by depression? Is there any alternative treatment for major depression? I would appreciate any advice.

"""I don't wanna die, but I ain't keen on livin' either."" Sorry for the Robbie lyric. I just want to vocalize a bit before the rare fancy passes and I go back to soldiering on alone. I'm sorry if this rambles or doesn't quite make sense, but if I leave the stream of consciousness or reread I will probably delete because I loathe the idea of complaining to others or whinging knowing full well I've probably got it better than most people here. But a part of me wants to know that someone else experiences depression the same way, as some small solace.      I'm never particularly sad, nor do I hate or wish harm upon myself or my life or the people in it. However, in every waking moment I have a weight emanating from my core, like a gravitational pull sucking in my ability to want anything meaningful.      The best way I can put it is in the title - I simply don't want to *be*. And that's not because I'm overwhelmed by hardship or struggle, I've got it pretty good and there's nowhere I'd rather be. If, hypothetically, you took me back to before my birth and laid out an incredible life for me and said ""alright, you're about to be born, ready to go?"" I'd say ""no thanks, I'm good"".      With a core belief like that there's no life to live. Career advancement serves no purpose but to consume more time, and I'd be taking a good job from someone who actually gets some personal value out of it. Romance is off the cards because someone who wants to date someone who doesn't want anything from life, probably also isn't worth being with. And heaven forbid someone should want kids! Hey Junior, daddy doesn't like his existence but he had you anyway, what an asshole.     I should stop before I become some combination of ""old man yells at cloud"" and ""whiny emo stereotype"". This stuff sits on me every day and I wish the small part of me that wants the affirmation of others wasn't there. But it is, so here I am.",i not wanna die ai not keen livin either sorry robbie lyric just want vocalize bit rare fancy pass soldiering alone sorry ramble doe not quite make sense leave stream consciousness reread probably delete loathe idea complaining whinging knowing probably got better people here want know experience depression way small solace particularly sad hate wish harm life people it however waking moment weight emanating core like gravitational pull sucking ability want meaningful best way title simply not want be not overwhelmed hardship struggle got pretty good be if hypothetically took birth laid incredible life said alright born ready go say no thanks good core belief like life live career advancement serf purpose consume time taking good job actually get personal value it romance card want date doe not want life probably not worth with heaven forbid want kid hey junior daddy doe not like existence anyway asshole stop combination old man yell cloud whiny emo stereotype stuff sits day wish small want affirmation not there is am,0.4507998824119568,0.5181362628936768,0.45929375290870667

"Dead Mom, Schizophrenic Father. I wrote a 1,900 page message but I figured no one would read it. My mother committed suicide because I left home after years of neglect and emotional abuse. I couldn’t go to my father because he has severe schizophrenia and it’s not safe to be around him. I moved across country after my sister who had left a year prior convinced me to do. After I moved across country my sister gave me 2 weeks to get an apartment or she’d kick me out. I got a job and an apartment (with the help of a really shitty roommate) and I had been working practically trying to just ignoring my previous life. A week ago I found out my mother had killed herself and now me and my sister are back to our old home trying to fix all the problems created by her unexpected (I honestly expected it) death. I’ve left all details out because I could fill a fucking book with them but the main point of this post is, I’ve been fighting all my life for a better life but things always seem to get worse and worse. I’m at the point where I feel like joining my mother.

"Little sister has depression, what do I do? As the title says my baby sister has depression and I heard from my boyfriend this subreddit gives him support. I just discover the past summer that my little sister (14) has depression and is now cutting her self with razor blades. I warned my mother that I read her diary and she was counting calories first in September. Earlier this week I told her to keep an eye on her cause I think she is depressed, btw I live in another continent at home and thus have limited access on how much I see them. My mom said she will keep an eye to see if she is cutting herself or not. We recently discovered that she does in deed and her circle of friends have depression too. She is being bullied as well by one guy at school and confidant has depression and is cutting himself as well.   She opened up to my parents and one of close friends who is a professional who works with children a lot, isn’t a psychologist.  My mom is very supportive as well as the rest of my family and we just want to help my little sister. My mom is not sure what to do, and neither am I. I suggested to look for professional help for her, as she is harming herself. However, we are not sure what to do about her surroundings. Most of her friends have depression and she is doing badly in school on top of that she is being bullied. What do you guys think? Change her of school and remove her from the toxic environment or leave her there and get her a psychologist?

I told her months ago that I wasn't sure if I could still be in a relationship with her anymore. She really needed a therapist so I really encouraged her to go. I think she may have only gone in an effort to save our marriage rather than herself. She's gotten new meds and this has happened over about 6mo. Last night I found a long search history of methods of suicide and I found a suicide note post dated a month from now. She's giving enough time to prepare everything. I'm not sure what to do.

"Im a mess and I need to rant. Every so often, I'll find a glimmer of hope and try my hardest to change my life. I'll start exercising and eating healthy, and pushing myself to talk to people, and I'll actually feel pretty good for a few days. Then I just stop. I'll wake up one day and and have absolutely no desire to be healthy anymore and slip right back into feeling like shit and hating myself because I can't commit to the simplest of things. This is probably the fourth time it's happened in the past year. I made some really bad choices today regarding food, which made me feel so much worse because in my eyes, my worth as a human being is directly tied to the shape of my body. Nobody could  ever convince me that it's not.  This past bought of motivation, I tried to convince myself that I was going to exercise and eat right for the sake of my health, but in the back of my mind, I knew the only real reason was because I wanted to lose weight. And now here I am, completely abandoned diet and exercise and right back into the throws of depression. All I want to do anymore is lay in bed and try to fall asleep. I don't have a job (or the desire to have one) and I lost most of my friends because I never talked to them. I live with my mom who I thought I could talk to about anything, but I feel like I can't tell her about how bad it's gotten. It doesn't help that she tells me everyday that I need to get a job. I know she is right, but it makes me feel like an even bigger piece of garbage because I've never held down a job for more than 4 months. If I got a job right now, I'd probably have a breakdown and quit the first week.  I went through cosmetology school and put myself into debt just to wind up hating the field and trying to lie to myself that I didn't. I thought it was all about doing hair, but it turns out it's all about trying to get people to buy some shitty hair product. I know my outlook on the world is fucked up, but I don't know how to change myself. It's like all these negative thoughts are engraved in the back of my skull. I just feel like I'm stuck and any move I make is the wrong one.    Sorry this is all over the place, I'm just really deep into it right now and needed to vent.
