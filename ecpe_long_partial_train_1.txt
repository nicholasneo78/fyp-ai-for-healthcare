1,null,null,I was just curious what your feelings are on long  term outcomes for depression 
2,null,null,A little background for me
3,null,null, I have been on and off medicines for several years 
4,null,null,I was always depressed as a child  but 
5,null,null,did not really seek professional help until maybe 10 years ago
6,null,null,I originally went on medicines 
7,null,null,for severe pms prescribed to me by my ob  gyn 
8,null,null,I just kind of continued on with it because it made me feel  leveled out  
9,null,null,Then I had issues with sleep apnea  joint pains etc 
10,null,null,My neurologist put me on Effexor 
11,null,null,Every time I tried to go off that drug
12,null,null,I was dizzy and 
13,null,null,had bad side effects
14,null,null,Finally  I reduced the dose myself and 
15,null,null,weaned myself off the Effexor
16,null,null,I had gained a tremendous amount of weight 
17,null,null,I was off all medicines for 8 months
18,null,null,and then I really feel into a dark depression 
19,null,null,It was then that I sought a therapist  etc 
20,null,null,I have been on medicines ever since  since June of 2004 
21,null,null,I had lost 40 pounds by going off the medicines  but 
22,depressed,depressed,then became depressed again
23,null,null,following several deaths and major life events 
24,null,null,I was put on Lexapro and 
25,null,null,gained weight
26,null,null,Not wanting to gain weight again  I hated being on the medicines 
27,null,null,He kept saying it will stabilize 
28,null,null,I told him that the weight gain was making me more depressed 
29,null,null,Finally  he changed my medicines to Wellbutrin 
30,null,null,We talked about trying to go off medicines when life events settled down 
31,null,null,my main reason to go off was the weight gain 
32,null,null,Immediately the weight came back off 
33,null,null,That was a year ago 
34,null,null,Now a year later  I am still losing about a pound or two a month 
35,null,null,The last time I went in  he did not say anything about going off the medicines 
36,null,null,How long do people take medicines 
37,null,null,Is it just better to stay on them and not fall back into the hole 
38,null,null,Are there any long  term use side effects to be concerned with 
39,null,null,Is this something I will probably be on forever 
40,null,null,It just seems like I will always be like this 
41,null,null,It just seems like depression is always just standing back in the shadows 
42,null,null,I go for a very long time and
43,null,null,feel fine
44,null,null,and then I have a week where I get very down and know that if I was not on medicines 
45,null,null,it would be very bad 
46,null,null,I have not gone to talk to my therapist in a long while 
47,null,null,When I am having these bouts of depression  should I call and 
48,null,null,say I need to go in for a  check  up 
49,null,null,I do not really have any specific issues to discuss 
50,null,null,The big thing right now is I just feel down because I have lost my closest friends and do not feel like I have any friends to do anything with 
51,null,null,I feel so isolated 
52,null,null,Would it be good to just call and go in 
53,null,null,I just feel stupid saying I feel sad because I do not have any friends 
54,null,null,Are there any good books that you can recommend on self  help  esp 
55,null,null,negative thinking  understanding why I think the way I do  etc 
56,null,null,I found Dr Phil is book on Life Strategies to be very helpful in discovering that there are reasons why I do things and think

1,null,null,Hello out there 
2,null,null,Ugh 
3,null,null,I battle with depression  anxiety  bulimia  OCPD  BPD  and some physical health issues 
4,null,null,Not so sure about battle right now 
5,null,null,Maybe more like grudgingly coexist with 
6,null,null,I am 42 
7,null,null,I have never held a job with the same company for longer than 3 years  and
8,null,null,that was just once 
9,null,null,A few times  I think 
10,null,null,I have made it to the 2 year mark with a company 
11,null,null,1 year is a bit easier 
12,null,null,I had to quit my last job because it was too easy to use the job to fuel the eating disorder 
13,null,null, I lost 40  of my starting weight in about 7 months  before I switched phases and ended up with a pulmonary embolism from refeeding syndrome  
14,null,null,Right now I am in the initial hurry up and 
15,null,null,deny me so I can get an attorney phase of applying for disability
16,null,null,Thankfully I have a sister who is letting me live in her house  so
17,null,null,at least I am not homeless 
18,null,null, TBH  most of the time she is out of the country  and when she is here  she is just as selectively social as I am  
19,null,null,Because of waiting to get on disability  I am off my medicine 
20,null,null,I can not even afford the cheapest ACA insurance  and
21,null,null,even if I had that  I could not afford the copays for my medicine 
22,null,null,I am not eligible for Medicaid in my state until I get approved for SSI  SSDI 
23,null,null,I am not too worried about not having my antidepressants right now tho 
24,null,null,This is probably the most pleasant major depressive episode I have ever had 
25,null,null,It is not so much feeling horrible psychic pain as it is just been a gentle bleeding out of the vibrancy of life 
26,null,null,I sleep as late as I can every day   usually until around 1 or so   
27,null,null,hang out in bed playing games  reading  or watching videos  and only really waking up and being willing to be awake around 7 in the evening
28,null,null,I do not feel like I am living anymore 
29,null,null,I am just in a holding pattern 
30,null,null,I think back to what my life was like  even 8 months ago  and
31,depressed,mourn,I mourn for it 
32,null,null,At least I am not suicidal 
33,null,null,I think I just need a place where I can come every so often and unload my mind

1,null,null,Hi 
2,null,null,I am new to the forums 
3,null,null,I was going to lurk for a bit before I posted  but
4,null,null,there is so many of us   I mean  I knew 
5,null,null,but I did not know  you know 
6,null,null,it seems like the thing to do 
7,null,null,I am a 24 year old male
8,null,null,and I have had problems with depression for as long as I can remember  though it is become worse over the last year or so 
9,null,null,I was pretty heavily involved in music and martial arts for years  but
10,null,null,I am no longer motivated to do either 
11,null,null,I am still going to school  though Hi 
12,null,null,I am new to the forums 
13,null,null,I was going to lurk for a bit before I posted  but
14,null,null,there is so many of us   I mean  I knew 
15,null,null,but I did not know  you know

17,null,null,I am a 24 year old male
18,null,null,and I have had problems with depression for as long as I can remember  though it is become worse over the last year or so 
19,null,null,I was pretty heavily involved in music and martial arts for years  but
20,null,null,I am no longer motivated to do either 
21,null,null,I am still going to school  though I have no real direction
22,null,null,and I am afraid that my lack of motivation is going to cause me to screw that up too 
23,null,null,I started having anxiety attacks about a year ago and
24,null,null,they have increased in frequency the last few months 
25,null,null,They are  not to sound melodramatic 
26,null,null,the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with 
27,depressed,threatening illness,If I am in panic  attack mode  any slight pain or discomfort quickly becomes a life  threatening illness that is surely going to kill me in the next few minutes 
28,null,null,As ridiculous as that sounds  it is absolutely real when it is happening
29,null,null,and I live in almost constant fear it is going to happen again 
30,null,null,I have a hard time even driving anymore  especially on the freeway  and increasingly rely on my girlfriend for menial things like going to the store 
31,null,null,She is very supportive and 
32,null,null,is aware that something is wrong  though I do not think she understands to what extent
33,null,null,I have started completely avoiding any situation in which I have to meet new people and have a hard time even talking to people I do not know on the phone 
34,null,null,These symptoms have been increasing in intensity over the last 6 months or so and
35,null,null,exponentially for the last 3 weeks
36,null,null, I just lost my job  
37,null,null,It seems like quite a few of you have been dealing with these sorts of things for much longer
38,null,null,and I am sorry if my posting here so soon seems insensitive  but
39,null,null,its already getting to the point where I know I can not handle living like this for years on end 
40,null,null,I have suffered from depression for  relative to my age  a long time and
41,null,null,the anxiety attacks are absolutely terrifying  a little redundant  I know  
42,null,null,It feels like the last year is the beginning of everything completely falling apart 
43,null,null,I guess my posting here is a way to get the ball rolling towards getting some help 
44,null,null,I do not have health insurance anymore and
45,null,null,I am not sure where to go from here 
46,null,null,I have been medicated in the past  but
47,null,null,I have not taken anything in a few years 
48,null,null,Though  without insurance I am not even sure that is an option 
49,null,null,That is enough for now 
50,null,null,Thanks for providing a resource like this 
51,null,null,The anonymity of the internet lets me say some of the things I am afraid to say to everyone else

2,null,null, It is been three years since we decided to go our separate ways 
3,null,null,We both had different goals  desires and aspirations 
4,null,null,We were perfect together  but 
5,null,null,just at the wrong time
6,null,null,I am sorry things ended badly 
7,null,null,I am sorry
8,null,null,that for months after they spiraled out of control 
9,null,null,I am sorry 
10,null,null,I am sorry
11,null,null,I let you down  your family down 
12,null,null,I am sorry I buckled 
13,null,null,I am sorry I did not have the experience or the know  how to react to certain situations 
14,null,null,I am sorry that I made mountains out of molehills 
15,null,null,I am sorry at times
16,null,null,I treated you badly  that at times I held you back 
17,null,null,Three years later  we live totally different lives than back then 
18,null,null,I got that job 
19,null,null,I traveled the world 
20,null,null,I went to Italy  twice 
21,null,null,I have been to Times Square at midnight  and
22,null,null,so have you 
23,null,null,I did it all  but 
24,null,null,by myself
25,null,null,It is not what I wanted 
26,null,null,It is not what I envisioned 
27,null,null,You can not just replace somebody special with another person  and 
28,null,null,that you were
29,null,null,Special 
30,null,null,It is been three years 
31,null,null,Despite some triumphs and successes  it still feels like I lost a war 
32,null,null,An immense failure that did not personify my persona  it personified myself 
33,null,null,On the surface  I am told I seem ambitious  fully ready to attack each day 
34,null,null,On the inside  I feel defeated 
35,null,null,In the end  you found somebody new  which is fine 
36,null,null,I chose  whether consciously or unconsciously to stay on a different path 
37,null,null,I have tried new women 
38,null,null,Many beautiful on the outside  but
39,null,null,they are not you 
40,null,null,Oh no  no  no 
41,null,null,They all do not have what you had 
42,null,null,Not even close 
43,null,null,Maybe one day I will end this crusade against myself  against the past 
44,null,null,I can not change it
45,null,null, I can not alter the story  I can not lie to myself 
46,null,null,I wish I could tell you I am sorry 
47,null,null,But it would not change anything 
48,null,null,For you it is a battle that was fought long ago 
49,null,null,For me  I relive it more times than I would care to admit

44,null,null,I do not know if I am doing this in the right place 
45,null,null,I am confused  with all this 
46,null,null,I just need to learn more about using the computer  
47,null,null,I would appreciate any help or advice

 (4, 1),
1,null,null,My cat just got hit by a car I can not even think about it too much 
2,null,null,My family is a little sad but
3,null,null,are kinda telling me to get over it 
4,depressed,terrible depressive spell,I have been in such a terrible depressive spell for the last few weeks and
5,null,null,this just ruined everything 
6,null,null,When older pets die by natural causes I do not cry as much as because I know we gave them the best life and they lived very long but my suki was only 2 years old
7,null,null,she was so fat and adorable
8,null,null,and I can not believe she is gone just because of a bad driver 
9,null,null,She always came to me when I was upset she would lay on top of me and snuggle 
10,null,null,I wish I had more time with her 
11,null,null,now I have almost nothing that makes me smile
17 12
 (2, 10),(2, 11),
1,null,null,Humiliated and
2,depressed,disappointment,feeling like a disappointment
3,null,null,When people see me out  I feel so humiliated 
4,null,null,I have to make up some bullshit story about taking a gap year before I embark on a career when really I wanna say well karen
5,null,null,I am clinically depressed as fuck and worn down to the bone by my own thoughts
6,null,null,so thought I should put my life on hold
7,null,null,but no one wants to hear that shit 
8,null,null,I am trying to block out but
9,null,null,it is so hard 
10,null,null,I can not see an end to this  nothing excites me that much anymore
11,null,null,and the thought of getting a proper career job terrifies me 
12,null,null,I just want this feeling to stop  I can not take it anymore
18 9
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,Sadness is the only thing getting me through my day I am not really sure where to talk about this because the people in my life do not really understand 
2,null,null,I feel like I messed up a lot of my life and the track it was going on 
3,depressed,disappointed and sad,Now I am just very disappointed and sad with myself 
4,null,null,I have tried pills and therapy 
5,null,null,However  this might sound weird  but
6,null,null,my sadness is the only thing pulling me through the day and making it pass by quickly 
7,null,null,I do not know how to explain it because most people associate sadness with something they instantly want 
8,null,null,gone
9,null,null,Anyone else feel this way 
19 182
 (130, 121),
1,null,null,I just really need to vent 
2,null,null,For a start  I understand everyone in life are at different levels and that depression and anxiety is different for everyone and I am in no way stating who has it worst or better 
3,null,null,I have taken hours and hours of training in it
4,null,null,and I am not here to speak or preach about how to help 
5,null,null,In a rare occasion in my life I am asking for help  guidance
6,null,null, I do not know the correct word
7,null,null,but maybe if I explain myself a bit it may help 
8,null,null,This maybe long
9,null,null,and I do apologize
10,null,null,but I just need to say all of this SOMEWHERE 
11,null,null,I am gay guy that recently moved from a conservative town in Montana to the amazing city of Portland  OR 
12,null,null,I came out of the closet the summer going into my freshman year of high school  dealt with a  simply put  shitty childhood while growing up in the Bible Belt of northern Florida  with an abusive father and worrying  even at the age of 78 about how my future would play out in this 
13,null,null,My mom divorced and and 
14,null,null,remarried a man that does not accept my sexuality personally but supports my life decision
15,null,null,says he loves me
16,null,null,We moved to Montana  my mom  me and him  and
17,null,null,I began to feel like I did have a purpose when I was introduced to acting onstage at a local theatre that I fell in love with 
18,null,null,Life  for a few years  was amazing but
19,null,null,my high school at the time was having a crisis 
20,null,null,Unfortunately four students had committed suicide between my freshman and junior year and  
21,null,null,with the help of many  started a suicide awareness program in the city and lead that for a year or so
22,null,null,My senior year  literally three days before it started  my military brother committed suicide on base  it was suspected it was also his sexuality 
23,null,null,But also in my senior year  near the end of it  I met a man whom I fell in love with
24,null,null, which is what I am getting too  just bare with me  
25,null,null,We were able to spend a lot of time together for a month or two before he had to leave to Portland
26,null,null, before I had gone  for a work internship where he would go back home to Brazil once completed 
27,null,null,He treats me like gold  and
28,null,null,I really mean that  he has been nothing but amazing to me 
29,null,null,He flew me out to Portland
30,null,null,so I could visit him for two weeks where we fell even more in love 
31,null,null,Everything was shattered when he left for home
32,null,null,and I also left for an adventure 
33,null,null,After I graduated  I had the amazing opportunity to go to the BEAUTIFUL island of Taiwan  where I spent an amazing year learning Chinese  Mandarin   meeting people all around the world  experiencing a new culture for the first time  it was indeed a life changing time for me 
34,null,null,But it was not easy for my boyfriend and
35,null,null,I We fought in occasion  texting makes it really hard to communicate emotions  and
36,null,null,we only had about two hours out of our days to talk due to the harsh time zone differences 
37,null,null,The year went by quite quickly and
38,null,null,he surprised me with yet another plane ticket to Portland where he would also land only two hours after I did
39,null,null,and we would be together again 
40,null,null,It was only for two weeks again
41,null,null,but I felt complete 
42,null,null,He even proposed on the Fourth of July 
43,null,null,He was yanked away from me again soon after and
44,null,null,it tore me down 
45,null,null,My heart crumbled 
46,null,null,My next chapter in life had started once I arrived back from Taiwan and had seen my boyfriend again 
47,null,null,I had decided I wanted to move to a Portland permanently
48,null,null, found a decent student housing apartment  enrolled for school
49,null,null, I was excited  now this is where things become a bit much for me and why I am here today 
50,null,null,My  now fianc  was able to stay with me for a full month this time 
51,null,null,Now at this point I am sure you wonder  if you are still reading   why does not he move here 
52,null,null, or why do not you move there 
53,null,null,Here is why  He was on an exchange program when I met him that the Brazilian government paid for 
54,null,null,The requirement for that visa is that he must stay in Brazil for two years before he can legally move back into the USA 
55,null,null,In other words  he is stuck there while I am stuck here both separated and both in fear of him being rejected 
56,null,null,We applied for the fianc visa and
57,null,null,now we are waiting for the approval 
58,null,null,I refuse to move where he lives because of how high the crime rate is and due to Brazil
59,null,null,is economic status
60,null,null, we both agreed it would not be good for a white American target to live in a high crime area 
61,null,null,I know I have talked a lot about my fianc
62,null,null,but here is also what is going on on my hands as well that I just was not ready for 
63,null,null,Before I moved to Portland  I had to go to urgent care because I had no primary doctor and no money  only Medicaid  which they took 
64,null,null,I went three times for small bumps on my hands that turned out to be stressed induced and
65,null,null,all three times I went
66,null,null,the doctors said I have no idea 
67,null,null,Try using lotions and 
68,null,null,see what happens
69,null,null,Nodded their heads and 
70,null,null,left
71,null,null,Very pointless
72,null,null,but when I got the bill I was shocked and confused 
73,null,null,I thought my Medicaid had covered it  which it did not because while I was out of country my Medicaid had expired and no one told me about it  therefore I was left with a  600 bill 
74,null,null,I heard it off for a while because I had other things to deal with than the bullshit that the hospital was giving me about it 
75,null,null,Around this time as well  I moved in with my best friend due to a dispute I had with my parents  which really crumbled me  but
76,null,null,they still do not know how upset I am about it 
77,null,null,I moved to Portland 
78,null,null,and now I believe I am regretting it
79,null,null,
80,null,null,I moved with that same best friend where we would also share the space with two others  a couple from Hawaii 
81,null,null,We had Skyped then ahead of time in our excitement of moving and
82,null,null,we were all excited to meet each other 
83,null,null,I had a job lined up for me as a barista  I had a savings plan lined up for what I could and could not spend for money  school would be starting soon  things were looking pretty nice 
84,null,null,Well  it is not nice 
85,null,null,Not nice at all 
86,null,null,The Hawaiian couple does not like my friend and I
87,null,null,They stop our oven mittens and  and 
88,null,null,tried to say they were there is and hid them from us 
89,null,null,refused to let us use the garbage can in the kitchen
90,null,null,held little meetings about what it is we were doing wrong and how we could fix it
91,null,null,I was so thrown back
92,null,null,I ignore them at any chance and 
93,null,null,even had to take time out of my life to tell them how upsetting it is we had reached a level they had where to actually put sticky notes on things we could touch and could not touch
94,null,null,I find myself to be quite tidy and clean and fair
95,null,null,but I guess there are two sides of the story always 
96,null,null,That is the first thing 
97,null,null,That job I had lined up as a barista 
98,null,null,Big joke 
99,null,null,I met with the boss who said the store is not open yet and 
100,null,null,asked if I wanted to be a cashier for the university instead
101,null,null,I said why not  the pay was amazing at  1275 an hour and had benefits 
102,null,null,I did my on  boarding and 
103,null,null,was quite interested
104,null,null,First day on the job however they lied and 
105,null,null,put me in food service where I was demanded around by two chefs and four managers who did not know what the fuck they were doing
106,null,null,One of the chef is actually spilt boiling grease on my foot and 
107,null,null,did not even apologize
108,null,null,The other chef was racist and 
109,null,null,talked bad about the Indian workers
110,null,null,so much I had to leave his presence
111,null,null,It was a toxic environment 
112,null,null,Income tax in Oregon was so high
113,null,null,I was not able to afford my apartment and 
114,null,null,realized I need to be working minimum wage to sincerely support myself here
115,null,null,I left after a month and 
116,null,null,am now struggling on finding a full time again
117,null,null,On a side note  because of costs and issues with finding a co  signed for a loan  I had to pull my enrollment for school as well 
118,null,null,That is the second 
119,null,null,When my fianc came to visit me for a month  my best friend  roommate was very difficult 
120,null,null,it is a harsh word to use
121,null,null,but she has a lot of learning to do 
122,null,null,I have been on my own since I was 16 in doing things myself  with the exception of paying my phone bill and buying a car  
123,null,null,Taxes  jobs  appointments  etc   were all me 
124,null,null,She needs some help getting there
125,null,null,and she has done and
126,null,null,amazing job to get there
127,null,null,but  every opportunity I hand her to take one more step of becoming independent
128,null,null,she rejects and 
129,null,null,shuts down completely
130,depressed,jealous and upset,The whole month was very hard for my fianc and I over how jealous and upset she got
131,null,null,and it was too much 
132,null,null,Currently she is back home for Christmas and
133,null,null,I am alone and quite frankly I needed it 
134,null,null,I just do not know how to handle that situation 
135,null,null,It was as if she was using her emotions against me
136,null,null,and it was poisonous 
137,null,null,It go so bad
138,null,null,my fianc and
139,null,null,Igor
140,null,null,an Airbnb our last two nights together
141,null,null,so it could just be me and him 
142,null,null,That is the third  I had to go to the emergency room as well when my fianc was here due to yet another kidney stone 
143,null,null,I got one in the 7th grade  near the end of my exchange program and one in a restaurant where the pain was so bad I needed to call an ambulance
144,null,null,
145,null,null,more money on shit
146,null,null,I can not afford 
147,null,null,I can go on and on with these stories
148,null,null,but I need to get to this 
149,null,null,it is my anxiety 
150,null,null,I was diagnosed with depression in high school but 
151,null,null,was taken off of medication
152,null,null,I was doing actually quite well 
153,null,null,But most recently  with everything that is been going on  it is gotten really really bad 
154,null,null,I am constantly anxed about everything 
155,null,null,when I walk down the street  I fear what people look at me as 
156,null,null,Now I am not fat  I would say I am average but my cheeks are so puffy
157,null,null,and it really embarrasses me to even look in a mirror 
158,null,null,I am constantly wondering why my fianc wants to be with me  if he is cheating on me  lied to me  etc 
159,null,null,I over stress about the smallest smallest things 
160,null,null,Example  I cried and 
161,null,null,broke down because I failed my drivers test for the Oregon license
162,null,null,I physically felt like I was going to die or
163,null,null,the end of the world was happening 
164,null,null,why 
165,null,null,Why was that happening to me 
166,null,null,Why is this ALL happening to me 
167,null,null,I miss my fianc  I can not get stable
168,null,null, I now starting out as an adult is not supposed to be easy but
169,null,null,guys 
170,null,null,this is really hard 
171,null,null,I spend any day I have off in bed
172,null,null,and I have only had one meal within two days 
173,null,null,I know I need help
174,null,null,but I do not have the money for it or the time 
175,null,null,I have never felt this insecure about my life  future  body  everything 
176,null,null,I feel like I am climbing up an escalator that is going the wrong way  and
177,null,null,no amount of running will get me to the top 
178,null,null,I do not know where else to go or who to talk to 
179,null,null,I feel like I have annoyed everyone already enough about me that I no longer want to talk to literally anyone 
180,null,null,My fianc sometimes even 
181,null,null,Well if you have made it this far I thank you sincerely 
182,null,null,I just really needed to vent 
20 9
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,Mum is questions are relentless My mum is always asking me 
2,null,null,How is blahblah from high school   
3,null,null,Are you meeting up with blahblahblah this winter

7,depressed,ignore me,They ignore me  do not reply to my messages and 
8,null,null,do not want to meet up
9,null,null,It is embarrassing having to explain it all the time 
21 7
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,Being an adult fucking blows  working a shit job that keeps me poor making me want to just jump in front of a bus Seriously struggling to see why I would want to engage in living when it is so menial and relatively pointless 
2,null,null,Ca not see any friends as I live so far away and my family simply do not know how to support me 
3,null,null,Working at a shit paying job with zero prospects and massive student debt  how can I possibly look forward to anything in the future when the present is always painful 
4,depressed,Mental illness,Mental illness is just poisoning every aspect of my world and
5,null,null,I can not be fucked to fight it
6,null,null,i just wish I could live more on my own terms
7,null,null,but apparently that is selfish and naive

 (23, 1),
1,null,null,My dad died today
2,null,null,So I am 16  coming on 17 next month 
3,null,null,Today my dad died at 42 
4,null,null,He has not been doing so well for a few days 
5,null,null,Yesterday his legs gave out and
6,null,null,he was stuck on the bed with his lungs in pain if he lay on his back 
7,null,null,For 24 hours  no sleep  food  or drink 
8,null,null,Many more problems that I can not remember  and
9,null,null,he is been feeling like shit emotionally too due to family issues 
10,null,null,My mom went to check in on him before going to the store 
11,null,null,Since yesterday she is been trying to get him to go to the hospital
12,null,null,but of course he is stubborn 
13,null,null,When she came back from the store  she decided she would have the ambulance come and pick him up because he REALLY needed to go in 
14,null,null,Slurring his words  despite actually being sober in the mornings 
15,null,null,When she went back to get his consent over phone to get picked up for the ambulance  he was out cold already 
16,null,null,Lips purple  lifeless 
17,null,null,cold 
18,null,null,It had been only 30  40 minutes since she last saw him  alive  or whatever was left of his life 
19,null,null,I was there to see a fresh dead corpse 
20,null,null,My dad 
21,null,null,My  dad 
22,null,null,
23,depressed,world is crashing around me,To say my world is crashing around me is an understatement 
24,null,null,I am just a fucking kid  going through my own battles with myself and now my dad is just  gone 
25,null,null,
26,null,null,I did not have the best relationship with him but
27,null,null,he was a really  really good guy and this stings like a bitch 
28,null,null,All of it feels unreal and 
29,null,null,at the same time scarily real
30,null,null,Everything is numb 
31,null,null,I am lost 
23 8
 (7, 7),
1,null,null, You do not have it bad enoughYou only think about yourself 
2,null,null, Got into a discussion with my SO because of my depression  anxiety
3,null,null,They told me I do not have it bad enough
4,null,null,and if I were worse off I would get my shit together 
5,null,null,So something in me snaps
6,null,null,and I admit I would actually rather be dead  whoops  
7,depressed,want to die,This leads to them telling me I am only thinking about myself and asking me how I believe they feel when I tell them I want to die 
8,null,null,Anyone else got to hear stuff like this 
24 8
 (6, 3),
1,null,null,I am lost hahaha
2,null,null,I do not even know why I posted this 
3,null,null,I broke up with my gf today 
4,null,null,I thought I was happy about it 
5,null,null,I think is the right choice 
6,depressed,self hate,A month of cutting and self hate is enough 
7,null,null,But now I still feel it 
8,null,null,And I want to cut again 
25 17
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,I have no friends This is not an over dramatic statement 
2,null,null,I truly have no friends 
3,null,null,Throughout the years I have grown a part from people and 
4,null,null,I have distanced myself from people I felt
5,null,null,were toxic
6,depressed,heart broken,I have had my heart broken by a few friends 
7,null,null,But right now I am sitting here looking at this funny meme I wanted to share
8,null,null,and I realized I have no one to send it to 
9,null,null,I hope all of this makes sense one day 
10,null,null,Goodnight Edit 
11,null,null,Wow  I did not expect this response 
12,null,null,It is comforting to know I am not alone 
13,null,null,We are all in this together  amp  I feel happy to know I am a part of a sub with so many caring  kind people 
14,null,null,If any of you need a friend or just need someone to talk to  I am here 
15,null,null,Thank you all for sharing your stories and responding 
16,null,null,The meme is quite funny  I am going to try to send it to everyone who asked 
17,null,null,Cheers

 (3, 7),
1,null,null,Constant battle between ambition and 
2,null,null,not wanting to live
3,depressed,suicidal thoughts,Since I was about 12 I have had recurring suicidal thoughts 
4,null,null,The thing is  I do not have low self esteem or anything of that sort  it is actually quite the opposite
5,null,null,and I always joke about being a narcissist 
6,null,null,I may not be an actual narcissist  but
7,null,null,I have always had a slight superiority complex 
8,null,null,I do not hate myself  but
9,null,null,I just hate my life and the continuous chore known as living 
10,null,null,On the outside  I have always been the life of the party  but
11,null,null,deep down I do not ever remember being happy 
12,null,null,As someone who is highly ambitious  it feels as if there is a never ending struggle between wanting to be successful enough to be well known or have an impact on the world  and wanting to stop existing 
13,null,null,Yet with the prospect of the latter  comes the failure of the former 
14,null,null,I know that if I lowered my expectations in life I would be mildly happier  yet the thought of settling for mediocrity gives me horrible anxiety and fills me with dread 
15,null,null,Recently things have gotten worse due to my university workload 
16,null,null,I have been having trouble completing assignment and 
17,null,null,functioning in general
18,null,null,I have considered getting help
19,null,null,but I feel deeply uncomfortable at the thought of opening up to someone  since I am not a very emotional person 
20,null,null,I have come to accept that I will probably never be happy 
21,null,null,I have always wondered if I would be more likely to actually commit suicide if I ever attained the level of success
22,null,null,I desire since I would have then achieved my goal in life  or if that would finally bring me the contentment I seek 
23,null,null,I suppose it would be the former since I can never be content

 (3, 3),
1,null,null,I am not sad 
2,null,null,I am not sad  but
3,depressed,no motivation,I am lost and have no motivation in doing anything 
4,null,null,It is hurting my school work  and
5,null,null,I am losing my grades 
6,null,null,The only thing I want to do is play video games all day 
7,null,null,I do not know where to go  I am just lost 
8,null,null,I have asked my parents for help at extreme lows  but
9,null,null,they think I am faking and their insurance is awful 
10,null,null,I do not know anymore

 (1, 2),
1,depressed,negative mood,Unstuck yourself I used to be stuck in negative mood and had suicide plan at one point 
2,null,null,I did not see the point of doing anything nor meaning of life itself 
3,null,null,One day a light bulb went off 
4,null,null,I realize the world is much bigger than any of us could see or imagine from our corner at a given time 
5,null,null,We should not refuse to do things just because we do not understand the point 
6,null,null,Instead we should celebrate the gift we are given 
7,null,null,Just go do things because we CAN 
8,null,null,If you are lonely  go talk to a homeless person 
9,null,null,You will be surprised how much you could learn 
10,null,null,If someone did you wrong at one time  forgive them and 
11,null,null,live for the future
12,null,null,Life has so much for us to explore 
13,null,null,The trick is to start on one thing 
14,null,null,Put left foot before right foot  then next 
15,null,null,You will feel better soon once you stop feeling by start doing

 (1, 3),(1, 14),
1,depressed,lonely,I am so fucking lonely 
2,null,null,My husband is my best friend 
3,null,null,He s my dude

5,null,null,Recently the whole family got back to back sickness and

6,null,null,No one notices that I am sad  and
7,null,null,everyone thinks I must be really happy about how everything is going  and it just makes me feel worse that I can not be happy even when I have everything  every victory is hollow and ever action feels pointless 
8,null,null,I do not even know who to talk to about this because I do not want to bother anyone  people have enough to worry about without me involving them in my problems  especially small ones like my feelings

1,null,null,A letter to my sister  who has conquered her depression
2,null,null,The letter you always wanted to write 
3,null,null,Family stuff happened and 
4,null,null,those wounds in you festered and festered
5,null,null,No one knew at the beginning 
6,null,null,You hid it well under your sleeves and at the back of your eyes 
7,null,null,Before it all happened  I sometimes looked at you and 
8,null,null,thought that this would happen to you
9,null,null,It is the way you used to hold your emotion 
10,null,null,It is as if you were full to the brim with it  but
11,null,null,you forced it down  shoved it into a box and hid it away 
12,null,null,It was strange  but
13,null,null,I was too young to understand 
14,null,null,And then  slowly but surely  it took you over 
15,null,null,You were so young 
16,null,null,In my worst nightmares I imagined finding your lifeless body 
17,null,null,I could not wake you up 
18,null,null,You would not wake up 
19,null,null,My darling sister  even now I still imagine your cold body 
20,null,null,How can such a deathly and frightening disease exist 
21,null,null,You wasted away 
22,null,null,Your cheeks were concave  and
23,null,null,you did not even have to bend over for every bone of your spine to be visible 
24,null,null,Your sharp wit and intelligent mind dulled 
25,null,null,Your eyes were dark holes in your face 
26,null,null,They were so empty 
27,null,null,You slept all afternoon and night 
28,null,null,I would lay my cardigan over you so you would not get cold 
29,null,null,But I do not think it made a difference 
30,null,null,You were lost to us  floating in some different universe with no anchor or thread holding you to us 
31,null,null,And then you tried to end it all 
32,null,null,Multiple times 
33,null,null,When I think about it  I blame you sometimes 
34,null,null,But I know that the blame is not really towards you 
35,null,null,It is towards me  of course 
36,null,null,I am your sister 
37,null,null,I should have been your protector 
38,null,null,Is it OK if I say that I could not really do anything but stand there and watch it run its course 
39,null,null,Or is that just an excuse 
40,null,null,You are my best friend  even though I am not always yours 
41,null,null,I wish I would be kinder to you  but
42,null,null,I probably will always hold some of myself away 
43,null,null,Maybe I am punishing myself 
44,null,null,I do not know 
45,null,null,No one can say it did not take a toll on all of us 
46,null,null,You probably do not remember  but
47,null,null,we were going to the corner shop together once 
48,null,null,As we chatted  you were vehement that you were a failure 
49,null,null,I asked you  what on earth were you a failure at 
50,null,null,What life had you lived that you possibly could have failed 
51,null,null,And you said  I failed at life 
52,null,null,So what was the alternative  my dear 
53,null,null,Death 
54,null,null,I am telling you
55,depressed,fear, I lived those few years in the fear that you would be taken away from us by your own hand 
56,null,null,Even as I am writing this  I do not know where to start or end 
57,null,null,In my mind  it is such a mess 
58,null,null,It does not matter because you are well now 
59,null,null,I have never seen someone work harder 
60,null,null,You are radiant and beautiful and clever and sarcastic and
61,null,null,so special
62,null,null,I could not tell you how much if I tried 
63,null,null,I hope you will always appreciate the battles you have fought and won 
64,null,null,I hope you always believe you are a success 
65,null,null,I wish you all the happiness you deserve 
66,null,null,Love you  babe

5,null,null,I tried to save our plans  but
6,null,null,she seemed disinterested 
7,depressed,distraught,I was so distraught and caught up in sadness and self  hatred that I  wanting to distance myself from the situation  not just leaving it alone  told her I wanted to break up with her out of sheer emotional irrationality 
8,null,null,It turns out I was sadder without her  and
9,null,null,she reached out to me to talk soon later 
10,null,null,We got back together  and
11,null,null,she said she was okay 
12,null,null,The way she described the whole situation let me know she understood my plight completely  but

18,null,null,I have fallen into a depression of guilt to a magnitude that I have not experienced since I was a self  loathing near  friendless 7th grader with pent up emotions drowning it all out with video games while tanking his grades  watching the few distant friends get reward after reward  trophy after trophy

25,null,null,Her mom even said  ehh  you two were just stressed out teenagers   but
26,null,null,I am still not convinced 
27,null,null,I feel like there is something deeply wrong with me

3,null,null,I have been with this girl since 9th grade
4,null,null,I am now 23
5,null,null,and I can honestly say I love her with my whole heart 
6,null,null,I have been abusing drugs of all variety since I was 15  herion  meth  pills  uppers  downers  alcohol  marijuana  research chemicals  but
7,null,null, it does not matter
8,null,null,I prefer if it fits into a syringe 
9,null,null,I have been to rehab 9 times since I was 15
10,null,null,I would get sober then relapse sober then relapse sober etc 
11,null,null,I have had legal trouble and
12,null,null,been in and out of jail
13,null,null,she has been with me through it all  she has always been my better half 
14,null,null,No words can explain how blessed I have been to have her 
15,null,null,This past relapse
16,null,null,I was clean for two years before hand and
17,null,null,our relationship had never been better
18,null,null,we were both happy
19,null,null,we both trusted and
20,null,null,we both loved no matter what 
21,null,null,She helped me get my ged 
22,null,null,And she helped me through my grandfathers death  he raised me  
23,null,null,I had subtle depression over it
24,null,null,I felt like
25,null,null,that was normal losing a loved one and all 
26,null,null,but I eventually stopped doing the things I was susposed to to maintain my sobriety
27,null,null, I felt like I was cured and no longer needed all the recovery stuff 
28,null,null,I was wrong 
29,null,null,So one day I decided to take some benzodiazepines and
30,null,null,that made me go straight to crystal meth in the time frame of a week
31,null,null,I was back shooting meth spending all of my money on it and staying up for days 
32,null,null,When on meth I have serious delusions I accused her of cheating on me
33,null,null,I actually believed these delusions with my whole heart
34,null,null,I felt so betrayed and hurt
35,null,null, I wanted to die 
36,null,null,What I feel like really did
37,null,null,it was
38,null,null,I accused her of cheating on Facebook 
39,null,null,Even after multiple people telling me
40,null,null,I was wrong
41,null,null,I could not believe it
42,null,null, I just KNEW everybody was out to get me especially her
43,null,null, I was very unfair and 
44,null,null,called her names and called her at all hours of the night  completely out of character of me
45,null,null,After being the good loving boyfriend she knows and loves for two years I suddenly became a monster 
46,null,null,I totaled the vehicle I owned and 
47,null,null,went to jail for possession with intent  Benzodiazepines  possession of marijuana and dui
48,null,null,I sat there for two months  thank god  while I was in there
49,null,null,she told me she just could not do this with me anymore and told me she has somebody else in her life  this crushed me 
50,null,null,I contemplated suicide while I was in there 
51,null,null,fought anybody that even remotely rubbed me the wrong way and lost my appetite could not sleep
52,null,null,So I get out
53,null,null,and I know that I should just stay away from her because I love her
54,null,null,and I do not want to hinder her pursuing something else  I respected her decision to move on  after all I did publicly humiliate her 
55,null,null,So right now I have been sober a month
56,null,null,and I feel good in a clear minded healthy way  but
57,null,null,I have this hole she used where to be
58,null,null,I find myself riding around for hours thinking and crying 
59,null,null,I am very upset that I let this happen  currently I just can not keep my mind off of her
60,null,null,I just want our love and friendship back 
61,null,null,I am very depressed and

12,null,null, When I left  I brought my kids and myself home to my parents 
13,null,null,I have been with them since 
14,null,null,My mother  does not  get it

1,null,null,I have no idea what to do My husband
2,null,null,and I got into an argument last night that has lasted until this morning 
3,null,null,Through out the entire argument  he has called me horrible names and 
4,depressed,hurt me deep,hurt me deep
5,null,null,I thought i was almost over my depression
6,null,null, I thought i was getting better  but
7,null,null,the things he has said has taken me from where I thought I was all the way back down to extremely emotional and having suicidal thoughts 
8,null,null,The argument started because I was talking too loudly to his son while trying to correct his behaviour 
9,null,null,I am 38 weeks pregnant  and 
10,null,null,lately have been easily annoyed and upset by the boy not listening to me
11,null,null,My husband called me a bunch of hurtful things because I tried to explain why I was so upset 
12,null,null,Later on in the night he told me my mom and oldest sister were no longer allowed to visit me for the birth of our child 
13,null,null,Then he spent several more hours talking about how they were  rot gut whores  and how he does not want them around HIS son all because 2 years ago my sister invited me to a christmas dinner
14,null,null,she knew I was nt going to show up for and did not specifically include my husband in the invitation 
15,null,null,Yet his mom is coming a few weeks after  and
16,null,null,she had left him and his brother to fend for themselves in a trailer in the middle of a forest only showing up to bring them food when they called her and begged her for it 
17,null,null,But because she  has not done anything to offend  me  he is totally ok with her showing up 
18,null,null,Now he is talking about how if I want my mom to be here so bad  I can leave with her when she visits 
19,null,null,And I have fully expressed how depressed I am to him
20,null,null,and he is not even worried in the slightest

2,null,null,it does not have to be about wins and loses  or 
3,null,null,I failed what to do
4,depressed,immense feelings,Neither does it have to be about my past years and the thoughts that come with immense feelings that appears to haunt me 
5,null,null,The behaviors and mentality that I have does not have to be the end 
6,null,null,all be all
7,null,null,One major thing to include that its not about growth or conquering something in life 
8,null,null,I am not living to grow or to become strong after a catastrophic situation 
9,null,null,I am looking for my spirit to simply just settle 
10,null,null,I am not seeking any advice nor 
11,null,null,trying to raise my fist towards challenges
12,null,null,I am not seeking any of that just a settling of the inner me 
13,null,null,To me  that is important than anything else because I would gladly be able to live with that when I one day be out of this earth 
14,null,null,I am not the goal oriented type 
15,null,null,Its not about climbing this ladder of life 
16,null,null,I am not here for any of what most people are striving for 
17,null,null,I seek for my spirit to settle for all these years 
18,null,null,That is what I am chasing 
19,null,null,Most people are chasing dreams  families  success  marriages  money  respect  and fame  but not this human 
20,null,null,More power to them
21,null,null,and I am sure they will obtain all those things
22,null,null,but I for one am not seeking to obtain 
23,null,null,The human game is a serious thing filled with losses and wins 
24,null,null,I do not wanna count anymore nor 
25,null,null,try to get to the next level of life
26,null,null,Cycling through the infinite regrets and regression 
27,null,null,The only goal is for this spirit to settle some type of way 
28,null,null,I am gunning for an internal calmness 
29,null,null,Something that can penetrate and flood the mind of mine 
30,null,null,Something that can provide some internal at ease like affect for myself

1,null,null,Torn 
2,null,null,Need advice 
3,null,null,Hey Reddit 
4,null,null,I am not sure how to start all this
5,null,null,but i m going to explain to my best ability 
6,null,null,Here goes 
7,null,null,So  i have i had depression and anxiety give or take 3 years 
8,null,null,I recently opened up about it to my girlfriend and
9,null,null,she encouraged me to open up about it to my mother 
10,null,null,I told her about almost everything 
11,null,null,The one thing i did not mention to her was the  suicidal thoughts 
12,null,null,Now  for our family feelings is nt our thing 
13,null,null,We keep everything closed up and 
14,null,null,then repress it all
15,null,null,That s what i have been doing for years not just with depression but everything 
16,null,null,Now  these past three days have been brutal on me 
17,null,null,I had no want to leave my bed or eat or even sleep 
18,null,null,I just lay there and 
19,null,null,listen to music
20,depressed,suicidal thoughts,I have been having suicial thoughts here and 
21,null,null,there these past three days
22,null,null,I will have happy moments here and there 
23,null,null,But it does nt last  shocker  and
24,null,null,i just go back to feeling like pure awfulness 
25,null,null,So  I am a 17 y  o male
26,null,null,and I start senior year in August 
27,null,null,We are a military family 
28,null,null,My dream is the military 
29,null,null,That s all i have ever wanted 
30,null,null,I want to follow my brothers footsteps because he is a total badass 
31,null,null,All i ve ever talked about to people  when they ask me what i want  to do is how badly i want to join the military 
32,null,null,I do not think  with my current mental state  that i should go to the military 
33,null,null,But i also fully believe that if i do nt go i will disappoint everyone around me and they will be disgusted in me and i also believe that i will fall deeper into this dark hole i have been in 
34,null,null,I have come to ask you guys  Any ideas on what to do 
35,null,null,I am taking a cross country trip in 2 weeks with my brother
36,null,null,and I will ask him some things about this
37,null,null,and hopefully it will clear my head 
38,null,null,Thank you for reading 
39,null,null,I forgot to mention 
40,null,null,I want to go get help 
41,null,null,get put on medication 
42,null,null,But the military does nt accept people who are on anti depressants

2,null,null,I have been cold turkey from my antidepressants for over a month 
3,null,null,Sounds stupid to say that I completely forgot to take them for two weeks
4,null,null,but I have been doing so many different jobs over the summer that I have hardly been home 
5,null,null,For the first couple of weeks  I was fine 
6,depressed,suicidal thoughts,Now as time has gone on  the suicidal thoughts have returned along with extremely low moments  mania and anxiety attacks 
7,null,null,I would NOT recommend going cold turkey

1,depressed,depression,People think I just want attention if I bring my depression up
2,null,null,What is the point and
3,null,null,why is wanting attention so bad anyway 
4,null,null,Who would not want to be told that they matter and that everything will be fine 
5,null,null,If I wanted attention so badly why would I pretend to be depressed 
6,null,null,Why not just make up a happy story about my day instead of risking sounding like a psychopath

 (12, 10),
1,null,null,I know this might not fall under  depression   but
2,null,null,it strongly relates to my depression 
3,null,null,Example  Today I ran into a kid Brendon from my school and
4,null,null,he said hi and started to talk to me 
5,null,null,I went on with the conversation  but 
6,null,null,felt so uncomfortable
7,null,null,I know him and all  but
8,null,null,after the conversation  I find myself saying 
9,null,null,Wow  that was awful 
10,depressed,suck at life,I suck at life 
11,null,null, I hate myself and
12,null,null,I always think that everyone is laughing at me 
13,null,null,Even when two people are laughing I always think that they are laughing at me 
14,null,null,I am purposely putting off my license test because of this fear 
15,null,null,Does anyone have any helping words 
16,null,null,Thank you everyone

1,null,null,Does anyone else get very angry at just stupid little things 
2,null,null,It seems like over the last few months everyone around me is getting all they want out of life  and I am suffering with depression 
3,null,null,Which  of course  makes me feel worse
4,null,null,and then I feel guilty for not being happy for them 
5,null,null,BUT  I also get angry when they  flaunt  their happiness around me 
6,null,null,My roommate just started seeing someone she met off eharmony 
7,null,null,We both signed up at the same time for fun  and
8,null,null,while I was rejected time and time again  she was SO picky and then started seeing the first guy she went out with 
9,null,null,I am happy that she found someone
10,null,null,and she really deserves it  but
11,null,null,I get so ANGRY that she is constantly doing things with him 
12,null,null,It is like I have been replaced 
13,null,null,I feel like a 5 year old for thinking that  but
14,null,null,I just can not help how I feel 
15,null,null,Today  for example  I asked her if she wanted to watch a movie I had gotten off our digital cable 
16,null,null,We have it until 9 tonight
17,null,null,and she said she would like to 
18,null,null,I was pretty excited seeing as how I had not been invited to a couple of events this weekend in lieu of ZACH going 
19,null,null,Well  she just came down stairs and 
20,null,null,said that Zach is going to be coming over now
21,null,null,This ticks me off because she broke our plans  and I do not have a way to  escape  when they are here 
22,null,null,I am sure she is going to want to watch that movie with Zach  and
23,null,null, I know I am being selfish  but I do not WANT him here tonight 
24,null,null,I have not gotten to see Angela
25,null,null,all weekend and the one night we have before going back to work
26,null,null,HE is going to be here 
27,depressed,crying,So I have to put on my happy face and pretend that I am glad for her and happy that she has someone and engage him in conversation when all I will feel like doing is crying 
28,null,null,It is unfair 
29,null,null,Why does it seem like when you are depressed  everyone around you has these GREAT things happening in their life 
30,null,null,Angela just got a promotion  a new car  and now a new boyfriend 
31,null,null,I am stuck in the same job  same crushing car payment  and
32,null,null,I have not dated anyone in over 6 years

2,depressed,depression anxiety,I am 27  5 and a half months pregnant dealing with depression anxiety 
3,null,null,I have taken antidepressants off and on for a few years but because my husband and I were trying to conceive 
4,null,null,stopped this summer
5,null,null,My pregnancy has been pretty rough this time around 
6,null,null, I have an 8 year old son  
7,null,null,I have had joint problems  severe morning sickness  and terrible depression  anxiety 
8,null,null,My husband just does not understand what I am going through 
9,null,null,he thinks that I am being hateful or sad on purpose 
10,null,null,He contributes to a lot of the way that I feel 
11,null,null,He told me early in the pregnancy  that if something was to happen and I lose the baby or it was born with something wrong with it  he would have a hard time not blaming me for it even if the doctor said that nothing could have prevented it 
12,null,null,This was said to me because I was not taking my prenatal vitamins at the time because of the morning sickness 
13,null,null,I could see if I were using drugs or drinking
14,null,null,but I do not do those things 
15,null,null,I do not understand his thinking on that subject 
16,null,null,My mother in law is another person getting on my nerves 
17,null,null,She comes over uninvited and 
18,null,null,gives out unwanted advice
19,null,null,She also has a way of making me angry with her thoughtless comments which are hurtful and unnecessary 
20,null,null,I can not talk to my husband about this because he would see me as the  bad guy  
21,null,null,Sometimes I just want to be alone  away from people 
22,null,null,I feel like I do not have any privacy anymore 
23,null,null,My husband always makes me feel worse when I talk to him about how I feel 
24,null,null,I do not know why he aggravates me to talk to him
25,null,null,then always says 
26,null,null, Well  you ought to be thankful 
27,null,null,rrblah rrblah rrblah  
28,null,null,It is not like I do not know that I could have it worse

2,null,null,I do not know what to do 
3,null,null,Hey guys 
4,null,null,This is my first post here  I made this account because I need to vent
5,null,null,and I have no one else to listen to me 
6,null,null,To an outsider  my life seems okay  I am married to a great guy  I have a good job that pays well  my family is healthy and I have friends 
7,null,null,To me  my life is unbearable 
8,null,null,I am not ungrateful and  but
9,null,null,I really do appreciate everything that I have in my life
10,null,null,it is very hard for me to get out of bed in the morning and live out my day 
11,null,null,One of my main problems is my weight 
12,null,null,I know this may seem vain to some of you  but
13,depressed,low self esteem,it is a huge problem for me  someone who already struggles with low self esteem 
14,null,null,I have gained about 15 lbs in a year  and
15,null,null,I can not control what I eat  nor can I motivate myself to work out 
16,null,null,I do not recognize myself anymore 
17,null,null,none of my old clothes fit  and I can not seem to be able to do anything about it 
18,null,null,Every day  I tell myself  I will eat healthy  I will make better decisions  I will not speak down to myself  etc 
19,null,null, I will not hate myself
20,null,null,Each and every day  I fail 
21,null,null,This kills me 
22,null,null,My second problem is that I have a well paying job
23,null,null,but it is very stressful and demanding 
24,null,null,It takes up the majority of my day and
25,null,null,this stress feeds into my poor eating habits 
26,null,null,I have considered quitting
27,null,null,but I can not justify saying no to the money 
28,null,null,I am scared that if I quit to try to focus on myself  I will just eat more and more because I will be less busy 
29,null,null,I am a lazy  unmotivated person who is notorious for making excuses for herself 
30,null,null,I really need some guidance 
31,null,null,I hate waking up 
32,null,null,I hate getting out of bed 
33,null,null,I do not even want to shower or function 
34,null,null,I do not know what to do

1,null,null,Hi everyone 
2,null,null,I have been trying to find something or someone to help me out depression for ages  but
3,null,null,I am not an open person and it is been very difficult for me 
4,null,null,I was never happy with my life and 
5,null,null,been just running away from problems
6,null,null,I left home when I was 18 and went to London 
7,null,null,I wanted to start new life  but 
8,null,null,moved 11 times since then and always hoped I will be happy in the new place
9,null,null,But it is getting worse and worse  I am back home now  and 
10,null,null,start to realize  that I have nowhere to run and I am getting old for that
11,null,null,I had a best friend in London  but
12,null,null,she just used me and left when my ex went to jail 
13,null,null,I have no one to talk to
14,null,null,and I found so difficult to find new friends 
15,null,null,I never talk about my problems  just to myself 
16,null,null,when I am with people  I am completely different person
17,null,null, I am so shy
18,null,null,and I hate it 
19,null,null,I hate it when I want to say something  but
20,depressed,upset,my mind does not let me and I am just upset on myself 
21,null,null,I do not remember the morning  when I woke up with a good mood or without headache 
22,null,null,I have been thinking so much  that even when I stop I still feel this horrible pain in my head 
23,null,null,I tried to bring my confidence up with drugs  but
24,null,null,they just made it worse
25,null,null,and I feel even more depressed 
26,null,null,I have been thinking everyday 
27,null,null,What am I going to do 
28,null,null,and what is the worse about all this
29,null,null,is that when I decide something what I feel is right and in few hours or minutes I think about it again and my feelings change and change again 
30,null,null,
31,null,null,it is driving me crazy 
32,null,null,I am getting so sensitive on everything  I am crying from watching a stupid cartoon  or listening to the music 
33,null,null, I feel sick or strange high on everything I put in my mouth
34,null,null,I think I have lost myself  I can not see the point of life anymore 
35,null,null,Suicide 
36,null,null,I tried that  but now I am afraid of death  I am afraid of everything 
37,null,null,I would be glad if I could find some friends here 
38,null,null,at least one  who understand and could beat this depressive moods with me 
39,null,null,Love  Angela  23

 (52, 29),
1,null,null,I have had a rough time of things lately  which is partly what made me search for this site 
2,null,null,I have had recurrent unipolar depression since my mid teens with an associated anxiety disorder and a panic disorder that took root 5 years ago after I beat a drink problem I had at the time  between the age of 22 and 25
3,null,null,I used alcohol as a bit of a crutch which was a huge mistake  
4,null,null,Anyway these days I am teetotal  on anti depressants and 
5,null,null,only really get a bad time with my depression A during the winter months or B if something triggers an episode  circumstantial 
6,null,null,Usually it lifts up in the summer months  I think I might get a bit of SAD 
7,null,null,but last year my mother passed away on the 23rd of March
8,null,null,and it caused a huge crash in my mood which never lifted in time before the winter episode took hold 
9,null,null,I dealt with it by comfort eating
10,null,null, I do comfort eat at times  but
11,null,null,I also get bad food cravings in the winter for foods such as chocolate  cheese and carbohydrates 
12,null,null,so pizza and chocolate ice  cream became my regular fodder for a while  
13,null,null,Anyway that lead to weight gain which is besides the point but
14,null,null,which I was planning on correcting  as I have done before 
15,null,null,this summer when the food cravings wear off and my mood lifted 
16,null,null,Unfortunately it is not lifted as of yet due to recent circumstances 
17,null,null,Not only did I have the first anniversary of my mother is death to deal with  but my partner whom I loved very much decided that this would be the best time to dump me and completely rip me to shreds in the process 
18,null,null,He basically emailed  he lives in another city 
19,null,null,a few days before the anniversary of her death saying he wanted to end it 
20,null,null,I tried to contact him but
21,null,null,he would not talk on the telephone or by voice  and would not respond to any emails I sent him 
22,null,null,He then contacted me by IM on the day of her anniversary  23rd March  to rip me to shreds and tell me that he could not love someone like me before posting publicly on his journal running me down before posting disturbing replies to some of the posts on my journal anonymously 
23,null,null,but I recognized his ISP number
24,null,null,so I know it was him even though he denied it 
25,null,null,making it sound as though the whole thing was deliberate 
26,null,null,I would not mind
27,null,null,but it came out of the blue  the night before all this started he was discussing a work transfer to move to where I am and signed off with  I love you  
28,null,null,Next day  wham 
29,null,null,I am social phobic
30,null,null,so do not really have many friends I ca nt talk to about this
31,null,null, my mother was usually the one i d turn to
32,null,null,but she is not here anymore  so
33,null,null,my mood  although it usually lifts at this time of year  has taken a nose dive and
34,null,null,I am having trouble getting myself motivated again 
35,null,null,The emotional pain I felt on that Thursday was like nothing I had felt for years  I just literally felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest 
36,null,null,I could not sleep and
37,null,null,I could not eat for the best part of that week  although I am eating and sleeping again now 
38,null,null,Am I over reacting to what he did  because I am hurt as hell and completely and utterly infuriated with him at the same time 
39,null,null,I know I can be slightly prone to being a bit of a drama queen at times  over reacting to stuff 
40,null,null,and I can sometimes be a little paranoid 
41,null,null,But the whole thing felt deliberate as though he intentionally intended to hurt me  and even now when I try to contact him to get answers he is being spiteful and running me down 
42,null,null,Of course after this I spat a whole load of vitriol at him
43,null,null,and now I am being painted as the one that was in the wrong  and
44,null,null,he is saying he did nothing that warranted the vitriol and is the innocent party in all of this 
45,null,null,Of course he also interprets home truths as vitriol  and
46,null,null,I tend to be very open and say things as I see them  to the point of lacking tact now and again 
47,null,null,But whilst I am willing to stand up and
48,null,null,say I made a few mistakes and apologize
49,null,null, he is acting as though the blame is all mine and he did nothing wrong 
50,null,null,I just can not seem to make him understand that the way he went about ending the relationship was one of the most hurtful ways anyone could have done it 
51,null,null,I know he claims to suffer from bipolar disorder which he wo nt get treatment for  and
52,depressed,highly moody,I know that can make him highly moody  but I ca nt understand why he does not understand the hurt he caused me  or if he does  how someone who professed to love me  does not even seem to care 
53,null,null,He seems totally and utterly cold  
54,null,null,so cold it is chilling
55,null,null,I know he gets periods of emotional flatness because he told me  and he also told me he hears voices as well 
56,null,null,Could he be suffering from some kind of depression related psychosis 
57,null,null,One post he made to my journal was  Wisdom comes only to those who seek it  and sometimes to those who deserve it regardless of perfection  intent or even understanding 
58,null,null,The common denominator though  seems to be deed 
59,null,null,For one must do  or  in order for wisdom to take root 
60,null,null,be done to
61,null,null,Am I misreading that 
62,null,null,Or reading into it 
63,null,null,So am I over reacting 
64,null,null,Was I wrong to argue back with him 
65,null,null,How can I move on and 
66,null,null,get my motivation back again

1,null,null,Going to bed in the morning  waking up at night 
2,null,null,For about a year now  I have been going to sleep in the morning when the rest of my family is getting ready to start their day and getting out of bed in the evening  night 
3,null,null,It started because I transferred to online school
4,null,null,and I thought it would be fine to stay up until 3 am or so  but
5,null,null,it is gradually gotten worse and worse and
6,null,null,as I am typing this it is 9 am
7,null,null,and I am just now getting ready to sleep 
8,null,null,I am guessing I will wake up at about 3 pm and actually get out of bed at 4 
9,null,null,It is really screwing with my coursework and 
10,null,null,making my mental and physical health worse
11,null,null,People keep giving me reasonable advice like turning off distractions and forcing myself to go to bed  or even staying up the whole day
12,null,null,so I am very tired by nighttime  but
13,null,null,I just can not find the willpower to go to sleep or get up 
14,depressed,not motivated,I am not motivated to do anything anymore that I do not have to do 
15,null,null,I am starting to feel like a complete failure 
16,null,null,Has anyone else experienced this or 
17,null,null,is experiencing it
18,null,null, Also I am taking a lot of melatonin but
19,null,null,it still does not motivate me to actually get into bed

1,null,null,I am a 23 year old female who has suffered from depression for the last 3 years 
2,null,null,I remember having bouts of it in high school  hating myself and thinking i was ugly and worthless  but
3,null,null,it generally passed and things got better 
4,null,null,Then all of a sudden when i was 20
5,depressed,crying constantly, i just started crying constantly  feeling out of control  wanting to dig a hole and bury myself  not knowing what to do with myself  feeling hysterical 
6,null,null,I went on medication after a few months  and
7,null,null,things improved  but it is something i still deal with every day 
8,null,null,I am at university full time  as well as  and 
9,null,null,working part time
10,null,null,just feel like i am constantly on the edge of going insane
11,null,null,I just moved to a new city  and
12,null,null,feel so lonely  wanting attention
13,null,null,but i feel like no one is interested 
14,null,null,Worst of all  i miss so much university  because i can not get out of bed in the morning  that my tutors regard me as a bad student  which makes me feel so bad  because i know i am smarter than most of the people in our class 
15,null,null,I just want everyone to know i am not lazy and boring
16,null,null, i just feel like my body is made of lead
17,null,null,and i have no energy and no drive to get up in the morning 
18,null,null,I have just started seeing a psychologist and
19,null,null,she is really great  but it is so expensive i have to work extra shifts at work just to manage  which makes me even more stressed out 
20,null,null,I do not want to take time off university because i took last year off
21,null,null,and it made me feel worse 
22,null,null,I really love my course and
23,null,null,it is pretty much the only thing that gives me joy 
24,null,null,if only i could get out of bed to go 
25,null,null,i am so angry at myself  my life was not meant to be like this

 (10, 1),
1,null,null,My life is so hollow Stupid self pitying rant  sorry 
2,null,null,Nobody cares about my existence 
3,null,null,I have never been and 
4,null,null,can not get into a relationship
5,null,null,I am stuck in this isolated suburb for the next 3 years of my life  drifting between my school and home 
6,null,null,Usually I can occupy my mind with focusing on my looks or dreaming of the beautiful life i am going to have once i am free  but
7,null,null,recently i have been having to do more school work
8,null,null, i am used to just stumbling through school without really focusing and getting above average grades
9,null,null,but recently i have been having to actually work to compete with my peers 
10,depressed,break down,and I either reject it to stay in my dream world or get 10 minutes in and break down because it gives me time to realise how hollow my life is 
11,null,null,Nothing feels authentic when i am here 
12,null,null,There have been beautiful times in my life and
13,null,null,90  of them are when i have been abroad 
14,null,null,I just feel so genuinely empty whenever I give myself chance to look around and realise how isolated I am from people and the world 
15,null,null,And as a person who truly appreciates the beauty of human beings and life  this really hurts me

 (8, 8),
1,null,null, I want someone to be afraid of losing me 
2,null,null,No one has and
3,null,null,I do not think no one ever will  When I am sad  I browse through sad lines
4,null,null, quotes 
5,null,null,This came up  and
6,null,null,I have been feeling this way for a long long time 
7,null,null,I am unwanted  nobody ever wanted me  nobody ever said that they need me in their life 
8,depressed,useless,I feel useless
9,null,null, I feel I do not matter 
10,null,null,I do not mind being alone
11,null,null, I do not mind anything 
12,null,null,It hurts though  knowing that I will never get to know what it feels like to be loved  hugged or to be held by any one 
13,null,null,It is 3 am here  I can not sleep  I am crying and
14,null,null,this is how it is been for a very long time
