      "Thoughts on multi-family and multi-generational households and family disagreements Basically, I married into a Filipino family, and my MIL owns a fairly large chunk of farmland. She routinely expresses a desire for \"all of us\" (myself, my wife, our two kids, my sister-in-law and her husband, my brother-in-law, his wife, and his kid) to build a large house with a large living area. Each of us (read: each family) would get our own rooms, everyone would live together, and we would all be one big happy family.  Except, not. I have a number of reasons for saying \"absolutely not\". Maybe it is my POV as someone that was raised in America, but I value independence and privacy. I want my own life, and my wife feels the same. Having family involved in everything you do, always having your kids being compared to other kids in the family, and always being treated like a child just sounds like hell. Not having the freedom to have sex or even choose what to have for dinner sounds like hell. No thanks.  It is be really easy if her MIL was not a good person, but she is probably the most kindhearted person I have ever met. She is always there to help us out, financially or if we need anything else. We are there for her the best we can, too, of course. So it feels really bad to turn it down, especially since I understand enough about her culture to know that this would feel like a slap in the face. And there is the financial aspect, since the land is already family-owned. Acting disinterested does not work.   Anyone else have family that has tried this?\n",

      "Thoughts on multi-family and multi-generational households and family disagreements Basically, I married into a Filipino family, and my MIL owns a fairly large chunk of farmland. She routinely expresses a desire for \"all of us\" (myself, my wife, our two kids, my sister-in-law and her husband, my brother-in-law, his wife, and his kid) to build a large house with a large living area. Each of us (read: each family) would get our own rooms, everyone would live together, and we'd all be one big happy family.  Except, not. I have a number of reasons for saying \"absolutely not\". Maybe it's my POV as someone that was raised in America, but I value independence and privacy. I want my own life, and my wife feels the same. Having family involved in everything you do, always having your kids being compared to other kids in the family, and always being treated like a child just sounds like hell. Not having the freedom to have sex or even choose what to have for dinner sounds like hell. No thanks.  It's be really easy if her MIL wasn't a good person, but she is probably the most kindhearted person I've ever met. She's always there to help us out, financially or if we need anything else. We're there for her the best we can, too, of course. So it feels really bad to turn it down, especially since I understand enough about her culture to know that this would feel like a slap in the face.
