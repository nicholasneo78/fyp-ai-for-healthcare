I try so hard to care for other people. Why does nobody care about me?
I spent hours trying to cheer up my friend a couple days ago about her family issues. I messaged her today about my depression and she ignored me. 

Why? Why am I not good enough? Why do people say they care when they don't? People only like me for what I can give them. When I can give them support and be a good friend they like me. But I'm not good enough to warrant anything in return I guess. I help my friends when they're sad. Why does nobody want to help me?
