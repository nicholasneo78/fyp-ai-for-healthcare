How can I be happy if I have no friends?
I'm in my first year of uni and everything has gone to shit. I have friends, but they never want to hang out with me. I ask, and they just ignore my texts or say they're busy. I know everyone is really busy in uni, but I take this so personally. I feel like no one ever wants to be around me. I try so hard to be nice to everyone and it seems like they only return the favor when it benefits them. I try to be my own friend and spend time with myself but eventually it just makes me even more sad. I don't understand why I don't have friends. I've joined clubs and put myself out there and it just doesn't come together. How do I not let this bother me? How can I keep from being lonely when I am so, so alone?
