Girlfriend on antidepressants no affection
Hi everyone, my GF of 2 years has been on antidepressants for about 15 months, there is a definite lack of sex drive since then, but I understand that can be a side affect and she's acknowledged it and we've spoke about it. But sex itself is not really the issue. 
There is a distinct lack of affection. We never make out. Or really kiss unless I initiate it. Or hug much. It makes me feel shitty and lonely when I'm consistently the one pulling her in for a hug etc. I've spoken to her about it and she gets defensive and says she gives me plenty of affection and makes it seem like I've got a problem.

I'm just wondering whether anyone has any thoughts on if this is also a side affect or whether lack of affection is completely down to her as an individual?
