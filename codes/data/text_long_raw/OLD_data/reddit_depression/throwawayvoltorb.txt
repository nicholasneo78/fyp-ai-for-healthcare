The toughest pill to swallow is that I care about the girl most
I've lost all motivation for my academic life, have basically no ambition left and have just been floating around doing nothing the past few years. My parents trusted me and are probably disgusted by me right now.


I've lost all my Bitcoin in a fire. I was one of the early pioneers and had literally a couple hundred thousand dollars worth not too long ago. I'll admit this one was getting to me quite a bit. Especially since I could've prevented it.

But you know what really incited and is still by far the biggest part of my depression? A girl. A stupid, uninteresting, normal ass girl. But I love her. I love being around her. And she probably doesn't even give a shit about me because she has a boyfriend. We hung out at a park and had a great time, we always do when we talk... But she's never the one to start a conversation and never offers to hang out. Okay, boyfriend, but at least let me be your friend. Just planning a meetup is such a pain the ass. I wish you'd just tell me to fuck off, but you keep saying yes. All while you straight up don't give a shit about me.

Hope is the worst part. I'm still clinging to my failing studies, new random ass coins and this *fucking* girl. I can't even concentrate on the other two because I think of her all the time. I'm desperately trying to stay relevant to her in hopes I can catch her when she is available again and I feel like such a fucking creepy loser. All for that small chance.
