How do you guys make friends in a new city?
Moved to a new city after graduating college. It’s been 6 months and I don’t know anyone. I was really depressed in college, but I guess since I graduated I’ve “upgrading” to just feeling numb/indifferent to everything as opposed to feeling down. 

Any tips for how you guys who have made a similar move made some friends?
