Does anyone else feel like this?
Do you know that feeling where you just feel... lost?  You feel trapped in a world that you didn't want to be in, forced to try and functional like a normal member of society.  You want to die, but you're so conflicted about death.  You're conflicted about everything.  You can't decide whether it'd be better to feel nothing or to let out all your emotions.  You procrastinate so much, because it all feels so worthless.  Happiness lasts a few minutes, but rarely through an entire day.
