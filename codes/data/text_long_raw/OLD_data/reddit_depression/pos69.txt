Iâ€™m ready to be okay with being alone...
I want to be okay with being alone. Physically and mentally. 
Some days I can go home from work and be okay... but most days I canâ€™t. I just get really sad. And I donâ€™t even know why. I cry.. for no reason. Iâ€™m just super upset. And just constantly wonder how great it would be to never feel this again. I often wish I could just be gone and not exist anymore. But I donâ€™t want to kill myself... idk how to explain it. :( 
I want to be able to be okay without having friends. I have two friends. And lately I feel like they are just both rude to me and just donâ€™t care anymore... (they arenâ€™t friends with each other so they arenâ€™t like ganging up on me.) 
I just feel like Iâ€™m less important to them. And they are both just so important to me. And I wish more than Anything I could be on my own and not need them. Iâ€™m really not sure what Iâ€™m tryin to say. Other then... Iâ€™m just not sure if I want to continue this life anymore. But I canâ€™t kill myself. I lost my mom about a year ago. Well sheâ€™s alive... just not the same. She was in a motorcycle wreck, and sheâ€™s a totally new person. I canâ€™t even stand to be around her. We were best friends. And now I donâ€™t even have her. I know this sounds pitiful but I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore.. ðŸ˜ž
