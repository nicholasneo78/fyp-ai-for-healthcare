How to break up with my depressed/suicidal girlfriend?
I’m in a tough position... I fell for a girl over 6 months ago and we’ve been dating since. It’s faded for me at least, and I don’t feel the same way I did at all, but from what she’s told me her feelings for me have only gotten stronger and we’ve already hit the “I love you” stage. I still care for her as a person and there’s nothing bad between us nor do we argue, but it’s just not what it was and I feel like I’ve needed to move on for the past 2-3 months. My issue with this is the fact that she’s both depressed and has been suicidal in the past (not things I knew off the bat, but learned towards the beginning). She has 1 real friend and a sibling she’s close to, but aside from that she doesn’t get along with her family. She’s told me before I’m really all she has, but not in a desperate way (although I think it is that too). I don’t really know how to tell her or what to be cautious of because this is the first time I’ve dated someone like this. I know it’s a shitty situation but I need to move on in a way that leaves her the least impacted or in the best way I can. I haven’t done anything like cheat on her or hurt her emotionally but I know this will crush her either way...
