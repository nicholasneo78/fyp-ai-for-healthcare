Why does it take some 6 months to recover, some 6 years, and some never?
I know it's because we all have different brains, mental illness affects us all differently. I know some illnesses have no cure. 

But I recently saw in a youtube comment section one person said "I've been living with depression &amp; PTSD for 25 years, it gets easier every day blah blah blah blah..." and someone else responded "I recovered from depression &amp; PTSD in about 2 years... lmao"

Do those who recover quickly look down on those who recover slowly or can't recover at all? Also is there any more information on why we all recover at different rates other than what I mentioned above?
