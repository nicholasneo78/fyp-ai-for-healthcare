I will end my life, sooner or later
I’ve never felt more lost in my life. I have no idea what I’m doing with myself. I don’t even know how to explain how bad my mental health is .. I’ve made so many attempts to tell my parents how bad I’ve gotten, and all my mom tells me is that she’ll make an appointment for me to get diagnosed w/ depression, bipolar and anxiety so I can get the medication I need but she lies. She’s been telling me this for months .. I want to kill myself, because at least then everyone will show me the love I’ve always wanted. “When I die you’ll love me.”
