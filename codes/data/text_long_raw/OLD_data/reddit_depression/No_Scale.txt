When someone shouts at me, I cry and can't stop it
I am definitely deleting this thread later.

&amp;nbsp;

Basically, for as long as I can remember I've always cried when someone shouts at me. I think its because my dad used to get really angry often but who knows.
Any idea on how to stop this? Today I cried and I haven't cried that intensively for years. I couldn't even stop it after the person stopped shouting at me. It continued for like 10 minutes after. They must think im reallyy weird and weak..

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, how are you all?
I've been more moody lately which is both good and bad. Good because I've usually just been soo numb though.
