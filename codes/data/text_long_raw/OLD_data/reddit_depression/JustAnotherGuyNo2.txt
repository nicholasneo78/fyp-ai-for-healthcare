Need some advice
Should I try to fit in by pretending to be cheerful all the time or should I show how I feel?

The thing is the people that I am around are understanding and they haven't made fun of me ( till now) but I haven't become one of them because of this so should I pretend to be cheerful or continue to show how I feel?
