Getting motivated to get help
I was diagnosed with a mood disorder and PTSD ~1.5 years ago. I was getting help for a while but I dropped out of school and moved out of state so I just haven't been able to do that in the past year. I live with (and mooch off of) an SO but I've been fairly isolated for about 6 months. I've been doing online school but had to drop my classes this semester when I started working. Now all I do is this stupid part-time job. I should probably quit because it makes me incredibly suicidal. It's all so superficial. It doesn't feel beneath me but I really just don't mesh with it. 

Anyway. Health insurance. I can't figure out how to fill out the income stuff. A hospital near me has people that can help but I just can't find the motivation to even call them. It's like I'm trying to prevent myself from getting help. It's not even just psychiatric reasons that I want health insurance. I have a referral for a neurologist. I've been having memory issues, twitches, etc. I know I won't go without insurance. I probably could stand to get on birth control and check out some other persistent problems too but a) I know I won't be taken seriously and b) the only thing I genuinely like about myself is my mind so that's the priority.

I'm not completely not trying. I'll take St. John's Wort if I'm persistently suicidal but it doesn't help with motivation. I've been going to support groups. I'll "decide" to be motivated but end up collapsed and sobbing before I get out of the door. Play music, leave my phone behind so I don't get sidetracked. Tell people what I'm doing so I feel pressured to keep my word. Incentivize with promises of fast food, caffeine, or chocolate. I dunno what else to do. I can't even tell if it's laziness or depression or something else. The only thing that motivates me to go to work is fear which is also the main thing that prevents me from quitting.
