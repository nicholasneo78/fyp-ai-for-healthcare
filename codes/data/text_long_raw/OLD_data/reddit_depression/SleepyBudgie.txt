Has anyone actually outgrown their depression or mental health issues?
One of my biggest fears is that my depression, anxiety, and personality disorder will either stay with me forever or will increasingly get worse. I truly feel it’s getting worse every year and I feel I will never have a normal life or be successful because of them. Therapy doesn’t work on me, and medications may work some but only for a short time. My thoughts on suicide and self harm are getting worse also.
