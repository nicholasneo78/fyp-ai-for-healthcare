Wrote this poem today
I'm not sure, not sure

I'm not sure, not sure

Do I want to live anymore?

I'm not sure, not sure

___

Is it worth it to hold on?

Or should I let depression win?

Should I let myself be gone?

Or should I simply just go all in?

___

I'm not sure, not sure

I'm not sure, not sure

Do I want to live anymore?

I'm not sure, not sure

___

Should I pretend all is fine?

Or should I show them all the truth?

Should I end this life of mine?

Or see what waits beyond my youth?

___

I'm not sure, not sure

I'm not sure, not sure

Do I want to live anymore?

I'm not sure, not sure

___

Should I find myself some hope?

Or should I end it before long?

Should I stop trying to cope?

Could I prove my depression wrong?

___

I'm not sure, not sure

I'm not sure, not sure

Do I want to live anymore?

I'm not sure, not sure
