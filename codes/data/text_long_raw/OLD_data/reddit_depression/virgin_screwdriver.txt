I walked out of a job yesterday.
I took my 'dream job' in early January, only to discover that it isn't my dream job at all.  I thought I would like working in a medical office, but this particular medical office has two doctors, one part-time staff member, and a cluster of other problems.  


I quit on Friday; the owner asked me to come in yesterday and meet, and I did, but I didn't stay long, because she didn't show up and the other doctors on staff acted like my resignation never even happened. 


I've compiled a list of why I quit. Here's a short sample: 

- I hate the hours (7A-7P 3 days a week, 7A-2P 2 days a week; an hour lunch break was promised in the new hire handbook but is frowned upon by staff as a lack of commitment/dedication) 

- There are religious currents, including periodic 'prayer meetings' throughout the day.  I was treated dismissively when I objected and stated I'm not religious.  The owner is okay with the prayers, and says it brings staff closer together. 

- I was offered a management position, but after being hired, was told "I know nothing, and might manage eventually, but right now was incapable of doing so." 

- I was trained for three or so days before being expected to run insurance billing, keep rooms clean and do therapies, and run the front desk. 

- Staff is expected to remain available on evenings and weekends for PR events.


I know that quitting was the best decision - "sticking it out" would have been detrimental to my mental health, and I would have had no time to interview for other opportunities.  Still, at the same time, I can't help but feel like a burden to my husband.  


After leaving yesterday, I hiked 4 miles to the top of an area mountain (really just a big hill, it's a foothills mountain) and had a conversation with myself as to whether or not I intended to jump.  I intentionally didn't take my gun with me because I never know. 


I am afraid of being a disappointment, and I am afraid of never being a 'conventional,' 'functional' human.  I am second guessing my decision to leave. I already have other opportunities presenting themselves to me and I am lucky enough to have some money put away... but I don't want to be a failure. 


I can feel depression symptoms creeping up on me again, and I'm trying to fend them off.  I forced myself into a per-diem position today, just to keep in a routine. 


I'm trying to re-frame this as an opportunity, but right now, it feels like a literal nightmare.
