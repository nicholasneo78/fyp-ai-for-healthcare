How I explain my depression to other people
“Do you know that feeling when your alarm clock rings, and you don't want to get up, do anything, see anyone, you just want to turn off the world?
Now imagine you have that feeling every morning, and it never goes away. It stays with you, in the morning, day, night, when you are with friends or alone. You try to get rid of it, but nothing works.“
