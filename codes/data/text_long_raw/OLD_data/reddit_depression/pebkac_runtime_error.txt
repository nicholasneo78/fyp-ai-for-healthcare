Does anyone actually feel a little better with the recent Trump/Putin headlines?
I live in rural Trump country and work at a gas station. Suddenly nobody wants to talk politics, and my regulars and coworkers have starting acting more civil toward me. I’ve long since shut up with facts about collusion or anything related to the news cycle, but it’s nice to finally have the other side do the same. Regardless of your politics, it’s nice to no longer be a small community’s object of scorn.
