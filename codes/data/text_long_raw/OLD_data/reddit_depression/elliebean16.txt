Sometimes I don't feel like a real person
I feel like I'm just floating through my life, but my body isn't actually there. I'm trying to make sense of everything but its just really difficult. Tried to make sense of how I feel but its just a big mess in my brain. I've no motivation. I try, but I just can't. I feel stupid and useless. I just don't know what to do. There's so much more I want to say but I just don't know how to form the words to describe it. 

I know this probably doesn't make sense, it's just word vomit. I just needed to write it down. Just feel lost and alone right now
