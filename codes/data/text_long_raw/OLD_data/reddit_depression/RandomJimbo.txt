I lost my father recently, and now I have less suicidal thoughts
This isn't gonna be what you think it's gonna be.

If you read the title you're probably thinking my father was the reason of my issues. He was not, I loved him very dearly. I am extremely sad he passed away while I'm in such a young age (I'm 21) but c'est la vie I guess..

The reason I'm now less likely to commit suicide is actually I won't / can't do this to my mother. We had to plan and pay for the funereal and oh my days it's expensive. Already we were on the line of poverty, and this didn't quite help.
I just can't do it to my mother to spend even more money that she doesn't really have. So now the feeling of guilt 'if' I were to do it is bigger than my misery.

Now I just slate the days away, it's hard, but there's no other option for me right now..
