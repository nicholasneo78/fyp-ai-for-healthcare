My parents only having expectations for me to succeed just makes me feel like the biggest failure of my brothers.
Which not only is bullshit but also makes me just not try in the first place a lot of the time. Because if I try and fail its worse because I’m expected to succeed. 
I don’t even understand why they expect me to be the successful one. I barely got acceptable grades in high school until senior year when I just took easy courses. I failed English and nearly failed Spanish in 9th grade because I was too lazy to put in any effort. I barely ever brought home friends or did extracurricular activities most of high school. But for some reason I’m their grand vision for who’s gonna make the family proud.
