4 years Tuesday
Tuesday will be the four year anniversary of when my dad committed suicide. My 21st birthday was this weekend and I got pretty drunk and started to think about it and I just cried and cried in the Uber with my friends. I’m really thankful for them. But there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about him. The thing is, he was an asshole. To me and my mom. I didn’t know he was depressed, I just thought he was mean and didn’t love me. I really do think I could’ve prevented it if I’d known. I’ve been extremely depressed ever since it happened. I don’t think I’ll ever be normal again.
