I believe much depression is about a lack of hope
'I don't want to die, I just want to stop existing'

Sound familiar? People just want to end the tedium, the suffering of being conscious. 

But most people would be depressed if not for a goal. I think most people would rather not exist than exist if solely to pick cotton in the sun or mine in poor conditions. But people who are not depressed do these things because there's a goal, a reward afterwards. There's a reason to be alive

When 'whats the point?' is part of your mental vernacular and nothing brings a smidge of happiness anymore that driving force disappears

and all it leaves is a depression
