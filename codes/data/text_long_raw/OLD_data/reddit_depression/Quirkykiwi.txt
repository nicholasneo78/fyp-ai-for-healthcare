Had one of those days where I really wanted to just get out of bed and be with people: hit up my friends and no one could hang out or seemed into it. Really brought me down, man. I feel like I give a lot and don't get a whole lot in return sometimes.
And part of this is probably just egocentrism. I shouldn't expect my friends to plan their day around me last minute, even though I told them I was feeling lonely. It just sucks because I feel like I would do anything for the people I care about, like I would drop anything to be there. I put those standards on other people and maybe that's wrong of me.

Anyway, I just sat around with my pup and ate too much and watched tv so it is what it is.
