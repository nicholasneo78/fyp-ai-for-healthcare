I'm getting tired of this world mentally and physically... I am at my wits end
I'm stressing, reliving painful memories and always everyone's second choice. No one really cares they say it but it's not true. My depersonalization just makes it worse. I feel disconnected from everyone and everything including my family and girlfriend
