They told me that all they can do is replace my hard drive, but they can't recover my 10 years of bitter-sweet memories.
So I bought an external hard drive, thinking that everything would be safe on it, right? If I'm gonna spend $50 on something, it should at least be good at something, right?

So I exported every thing from the past 10 years onto it. Recently, my computer can't even read the hard drive anymore. I went to the customer help service and they said that they can't do anything to access my data and all they can do is replace it (within warranty).

All my graduation photos, friend hang outs, and all just precious moments, will have to go. I've always been looked down upon. I was never up to standard to anyone. No matter how hard I try to fit in, I knew I was an outlier. And now that all these memories of my bitter-sweet life will have to disappear. I should disappear along with them
