Just need a hug.
I'm a trans gay man and face a lot of criticism online. I talk with my friends about it sometimes because it really does bother me on somedays, but because it happens so frequently, I've noticed they don't really care anymore. I haven't talked about it in a long time even though it's still going on because I desperately don't want to bug them but Jesus Christ I am losing it on my own. Tips?
