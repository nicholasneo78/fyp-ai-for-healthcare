I get depressed, so I procrastinate, so I get more depressed, etc.
I hate my job with a burning passion but I can't bring myself to quit or do anything else.  My job is "prestigious" and high-paying so it's the only thing that makes me look successful to family and friends, which makes it the only tiny source of self-worth I have. If I lost my job, everyone would know the useless, depressed piece of shit I really am.

I fucking despise my job though, so I can't bring myself to actually do the work. I procrastinate for hours/days and only get anything done by pulling all-nighters right before deadlines. I could have an assignment for two weeks and I will still do it from 2:00 am to 7:00 am the night before it's due. The procrastination makes me even more depressed, anxious, stressed, etc., which makes me even less interested in doing my work. I know I would be less miserable if I got my shit together, but I just can't make myself do it, and then I hate myself even more. Vicious cycle continues.

I've tried every trick in the book to stop procrastinating but nothing works. Anyone else deal with this?
