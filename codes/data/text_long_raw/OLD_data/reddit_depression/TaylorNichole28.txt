I got a job and I made new friends
I’ve been sitting on my ass for the last 3 years while my boyfriend supports us both because I could never face my anxiety of job interviews, etc. Some days just getting out of bed is a victory for me. 
I finally forced myself to try and I got a job! I’ve made two friends so far and I don’t totally hate living right now. Making money and being able to help out is giving me a sense of self worth and I haven’t felt like this in so long. I’m not trying to brag, I’m just proud of myself and no one around me really understands how big of a deal it is. 
I tried taking a bunch of pills a few weeks ago and I had no idea that I’d be semi (dare I say) happy right now. It can get better ladies and gents, you just have to wait for it, I guess. Idk what I’m saying lol thank you for reading my babble
