It feels like my friend doesn't care about me and is rubbing it in my face
So the only best friend I had planned out for weeks how she was going to do something behind my back then brag about it to me and make up stuff about what happened to make me jealous. I immediately found out that she was making stuff about it up but that kinda just made it worse. It still bothers me a lot even though it happened in July and it's still making me depressed. I sort of stopped talking to her for a few weeks but then when I felt like I could I refollowed her posts on facebook and nearly every single post is like "I love my new best friend more than anyone else" not even exaggerating. I tried to ignore it but there were just constant posts like that I just can't look at anything she posts anymore because some how it makes me more depressed and lowers my self image even more though it's already at zero. Should I just completely move on? I feel like never talking to her again is my only option.
