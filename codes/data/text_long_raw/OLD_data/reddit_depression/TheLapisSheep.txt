Dear reddit, i need your help
I've never had a good relationship with my family. I am 15/m and always seen by everyone as overly sensitive and feminine. Kinda makes my life harder. I was recently diagnosed with depression after someone called a sub division of the Canadian child services because I was a suicide risk. Right now I'm on vacation in park city, Utahâ€¦ I'm the first and only one in my family with any sort if nenral problems. I end up freaking out on the inside and my parents just tell me that this is the best part if my life and u should enjoy it. Hesri g that makes me want to kill myself more than the usual amount because I know what torture it is to be alive and if this is the best it gets what is the point. It's currently 12:32 and I'm in the basement after my brother kicked me out of my own bed. I got about 5 mins of sleep before this happened and the part that really pisses me off about it is the fact that I'm an insomniac. It's a miracle I get anything and he just wakes me up. My brother is 10. When he was 8 and 9 he would have tried to drown me multiple times and stab me once. When my diagnosis came around he's been doing everything he can to.push me towards suicide. I go to tell my friends about things that have been said to me and things that I'm feeling and their response is always dude u have a gf don't be depressed or just what the fuck is wrong with u. For the past year I've been dating around and just before coming here I got broken up with. It seems like the whole universe is against me and I just need help
