how do you make friends?
i have aspergers so by default I'm socially autistic....but......theres 2 others at work with aspergers and they seem to do just fine. as far as I can tell from overhearing my co-workers...EVERYONE has hung out with others from work........not a single person wants to hang out with me. i'm not THAT ugly.......how do people do it? every year since high school (a decade ago) on my birthday cake candles...I'll wish for a friend....but nobody ever wants to be more than just an acquaintance, or to hit me up if they need something I can do for them. I'm coming to the end of my rope........I've always tried to keep a happy persona about me because I know nobody wants to hang out with someone who is 24/7 sad and mopey....I try to be funny......but I just don't understand what I do  wrong....I'm a hardcore gamer and the other gamers don't even want anything to do with me

yea...theres nothing going to come of this...i know....and theres more variables than can be explained........I don't want to off myself but I keep thinking about it
