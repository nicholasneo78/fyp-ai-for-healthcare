being cyberstalked by a uk kid ðŸ˜¢
I have some 14 year old kid from the UK that has been cyberstalking me for the past 4 months on my twitter, Facebook, YouTube and other social media accounts all cause we had a fallout over a wwe 2k video game (yes seriously). I've been trying to block him but he keeps making more accounts telling me to kill myself and that noone cares bout me. he has told me to shoot myself in the head with a gun, drink battery acid and tells me that my friends on PlayStation are no life's for supporting and putting up with me. He also hacked into my friends YouTube channel a while back and took it down thus causing me to have to delete my main YouTube channel and lose a majority of my videos due to him threatening to do it to me too. I can't contact law enforcement as they don't seem to care and he even went so far as to make a fake girl account on twitter and try flirting with me to talk to him. He's making my life a miserable hell. And my personal life isn't going much better either ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢
