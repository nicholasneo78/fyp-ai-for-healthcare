Frustration
I don't understand why I'm depressed... I am pretty sure I am depressed, I don't feel much joy in life, I have trouble feeling enjoyment outside of compulsive/ harmful activites, I just feel numb, pointless. My thoughts turn to suicide quite often, but I would never do it. 

I can say that I think of suicide somewhat less than I used to... so there's been improvement. 

I don't understand why I'm not better, or what else I can do outside of medication. I run, I work hard and do well at work, I am a dedicated father and spend lots of time with the kids, I'm dedicated to making sure they feel loved and cared for, their needs are ahead of my own. 

I try to do new things, and I do them well, but it all feels so flat and empty. I don't understand what else I can do to improve. I can feel myself starting to slide back down and it's really scary and frustrating. 

I feel like I've done every thing I can, but it's no use... I don't know what to do.
