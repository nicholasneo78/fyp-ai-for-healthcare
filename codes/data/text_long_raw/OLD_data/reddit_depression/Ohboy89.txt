I can't make it better
I'm tired of nearly every aspect of my life. Changing it for the better would require money.  To get money you have to work.  Work is boring and tedious and makes me miserable. That goes for any job I could realistically obtain. I can't do more than part time.  I'll never have the kind of money it would take to change my life in ways that might make me happier. There is no point to life so why suffer through the misery and hardship? I want to die but I can't kill myself. I'll never have the nerve.  I feel stuck.
