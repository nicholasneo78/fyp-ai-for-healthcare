"You have to give your life meaning," they say.
How exactly am I supposed to give my life meaning when life's basic structure is forcing me to live in such a stressful manner? We're all going in the same direction to an eternity of work and labor. I want to give my life meaning, but I'm too busy trying to survive in this stupid system. People try their hardest so they can barely get by, and for what?

So we can wake up the next day, right where we started?
