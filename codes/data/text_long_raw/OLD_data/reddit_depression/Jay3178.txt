Horribly depressed lately.
Hello, my name is Jay and just like the title says, I'm pretty depressed. Just... Ugh, nothing goes right these days. I've always had issues with depression, but the last two years have been especially hellish. I don't even know where to start, but I think the biggest problem is always being alone with my thoughts. I don't have any friends or people like that, and my hobbies don't even interest me enough anymore to keep my mind off it. I've thought about and tried to kill myself before, one attempt just a few days ago, but I can't even do that right. I don't know why I'm even writing this, but if anyone sees it and wants to know more or anything, thanks for reading.
