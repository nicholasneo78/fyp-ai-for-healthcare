So depressed that I developed disassociation.
So I am going to bed after posting thus so sorry if I don't respond right away.

I am 32. My short and sweet backstory is that I lost the love of my life because of alcoholism and depression. The way we broke up was the worst thing to happen to any person. She basically called the police on her way home from work, had me put in jail for a week on false charges and since I moved out of the state I couldn't call my family while I was incarcerated and charges eventually dropped. It broke me so terribly that I literally split personalities. 

I have the me that stares deep into the darkness all the time and the me that deals with and tries to make sense of the aftermath. Every time that person takes over I feel a part of me being lost. In a way it us insanely scary that depression can eventually turn into this. 

For the record Yea I do see a psychiatrist, a therapist and have a great support system. It just sucks because even with all that I am losing thus battle. 

Thanks for reading.
