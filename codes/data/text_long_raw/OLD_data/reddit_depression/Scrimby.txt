I feel like a prisoner
I absolutely hate life. I hate it. I hate the world. I don’t want to live. But if I kill myself, I can’t imagine what I would put my family through. The sole reason I live is to not hurt my family.

On the other hand, I can’t stand life. My mind...it’s like I’m terrified of living. There’s this dread I constantly feel from living. I know for sure I won’t be able to endure this for a full lifetime. Even a year seems too long.

I don’t know what to do. I’m trapped in my mind. The only way out would destroy my family, but I can’t even stand the thought of hurting my family.
