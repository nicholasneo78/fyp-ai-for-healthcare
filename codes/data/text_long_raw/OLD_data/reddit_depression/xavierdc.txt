Does anyone else's depression causes them to constantly daydream or imagine their lives are a documentary?
I daydream a lot about people I know in real life or situations I wish would happen. It's alternate reality I go to escape my loneliness. I sometimes daydream about being in a hotel in some tropical paradise or being in a very romantic date or just that I'm in some kind of reality TV show/documentary where I'm the star and the narrator at the same time and everyone admires me. My mental state worsens once the daydreaming is over and I realize it's just fantasy. :/
