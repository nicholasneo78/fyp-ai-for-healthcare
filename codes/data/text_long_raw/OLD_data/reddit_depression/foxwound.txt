I let out a belly laugh when I thought about the future.
I couldn’t plan the next 3 months, then realized how much of a depressed piece of shit I am that I laughed at myself for thinking I deserve a future. I’m so pathetic. 

Half of me finds it genuinely funny that
A. I deserve a future. 
B. I won’t kill myself in the next 3 months.

The other half can’t stop wondering how deep of a depression I am in and if I will ever get out. Three cheers for chemical imbalances!
