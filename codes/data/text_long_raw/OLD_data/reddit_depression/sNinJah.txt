Well i think i am good now
After a long time with depression (3-4 years) i can say that i am feeling good.i feel that way 4-5 months now but i wasnt sure. My therapist helped me a lot (still visiting her) and my ex-friend but now girlfriend too (even if we have fights often i know at the end that she cares about me). Last september i was ready to suicide i didnt like anything not even smoke weed like i usually do or play video games. I was lying in bed/couch crying all the time and complain that i dont have future and i will be forever alone.Thank god back then my family and my dog(ye my dog,was one of reasons that i didnd hurt myself) helped me a lot.Now i have dreams again i am looking for job i am planning with my girlfriend to move  to north europe and ofc i am smiling more than before. I know that i am still depressed i am not healed 100%  but  i know i am in the correct way.
I wanted to share cause i feel really happy and who knows maybe will encourage some people here.Hope!!
