Feeling Broken
I was molested when I was 5. I'm 27 now and I've never actually tried to deal with it. I just ignored it, but that doesn't seem to be working anymore. I feel terrified all the time. I feel dirty and used. I've started cutting just to get some relief from the pain. I don't know why I'm posting. I guess I just want to hear somebody say something nice.
