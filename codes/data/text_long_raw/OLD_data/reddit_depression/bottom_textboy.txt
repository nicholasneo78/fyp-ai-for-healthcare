Why did I get drunk as fuck the night before my midterm?
Is it because I'm depressed and I don't give a fuck about school? Is it becasue I'm using my depression to rationalize not having to study bc im a lazy fuck? but of course thats a symptom of depression. i just don't know anymore because sometimes i wonder if i'm exaggerating my depression to get myself out of responsibilities, fuck man.  wish me luck tomorrow i ugess
