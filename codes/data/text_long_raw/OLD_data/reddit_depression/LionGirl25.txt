Just a vent post
I went grocery shopping with my mom. I manged to get on the topic of politics and I mentioned how it would be bad if people could start discriminating against someone because of their religious freedom. She told me it should be okay to do this (brought up the whole baker thing to prove her point) while saying this she told me she loved me, but didn't like how I'm gay (pansexual with some hints of genderfluid, though she doesn't know the last part) because it's a sin.

I've always wanted my mom's approval, I want it so badly, I want her to turn to me and say she is proud of me..but since I was a kid she always got my hopes up, she always left me to chase after her next boyfriend.

The day she left my dad I ran after her car...I don't remember how young I was. I hated her for a long time...I still kinda do.

When I was self harming and tried to commit suicide she took me to a therapist to try and get my in a inpatient place...she didn't want to deal with me.
