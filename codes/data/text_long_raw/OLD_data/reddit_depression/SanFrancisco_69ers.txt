How do you get up and out of bed in the morning?
I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit but I don't really know where to post for motivational tips or tricks. 

I've done everything suggested on Google searches like putting your alarm clock across the room, setting daily goals, and trying to get myself excited for the next day but I would gladly just lay in bed all day. 

I'm a college student majoring in Finance. I'm not the best student but honestly I only care about getting my degree. GPA means nothing more than having the requirements to walk across the stage. 

I am doing an internship and doing 6 hours of college classes over the summer but both can be done from home and the internship is really better suited for self-starters. 

Once I'm out of bed, I'm good for the most part. It's just getting out of bed that is my biggest problem. 

Any help would be very great.
