Becoming fat
Perhaps due to my meds (some of them have side effects pertaining to increase in appetite and weight gain), and perhaps due to my ridiculous comfort eating, I have become fat. Which is very obvious because I am short and have a small frame. Plus all my tailor made clothes don’t fit me. 

Exercise and the lot don’t work - in fact I’ve exercised 30 minutes or more every day in the last 1.5 month - after all I’m not a young person, I don’t do very strenuous exercise and my metabolism is probably low. So exercise itself can’t burn off the additional calories I’m consuming. 

So this is it - I’m stopping with the crazy eating.
