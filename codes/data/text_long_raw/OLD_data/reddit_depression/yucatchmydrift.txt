My depression caused by other people.
 I feel as if a lot of people walk around like their better than me and I don't know why. I can sense them just looking down on me and judging me on my character and they don't even know me. I don't know if it's in my head or if some people are really like this.  Is it the way I dress? Is it the way I look? Do I not meet there expectations as a bystander? Like fuck, I was blessed and randomly put on this earth to be me, yet people can be so judgmental especially over things I can't control. 




Does anyone else have this problem?
