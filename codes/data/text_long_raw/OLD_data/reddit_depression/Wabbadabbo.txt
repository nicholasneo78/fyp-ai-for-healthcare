I feel like I'm in a rut. I don't like it here.
First post here, so here we go

Like the title says, I feel like I am in a rut. I am tired 100% of the time, regardless of the sleep I have had (quality, length, etc). Feel simultaneously under-utilized and under-qualified for my job at the moment. I don't feel like I am doing anything worth-while, but I also don't even feel qualified to do even this job. 

When I get home, all I want to do is either sleep or sit in front of my computer. When I am on my computer, I never do anything productive, just get into YouTube holes that last forever. I try to be creative; maybe try game design, or start writing; but it all just falls flat and I feel worse, not good enough. 

I have no real friends (not including work acquaintances, who all have their own lives to live) in my area, all of them are online, and again, they all have their own lives too. 

I feel unimportant, I feel un-unique (is this even a word? words are hard), I feel exhausted. I don't know what to do. Even now I feel stupid for writing this on the freaking Depression subreddit.

I just feel alone.
