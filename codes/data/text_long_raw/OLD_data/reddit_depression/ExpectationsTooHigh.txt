The only time I can enjoy my life is when I'm watching anime/listening to music
Every time I put on those headphones that allow me to leave this miserable reality, I feel alive. Any other time I feel like I'm just lifelessly struggling to deal with my responsibilities. That's why I listen to music all the time. That's why I only get excited when watching anime. I need fiction to get me through a day or else I go completely numb.

So uhh is this a problem? Or is it normal?
