Is it normal to have bad thoughts at night?
Almost every night for the past few months now ends up with me either crying in a pillow and thinking about how shitty my life has been, or researching and thinking about fast ways to die. Is this normal? I don't take any medications, nothing has happened to me/anybody in my family recently, and it normally happens at around 1 or 2 A.M.
