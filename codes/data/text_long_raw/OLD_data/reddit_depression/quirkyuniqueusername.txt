How can I get out of an almost constant state of dissociation?
A majority of the time I’m just in a state of dissociation. It’s difficult for me to describe, but it’s like I’m just not mentally there. It’s like a constant state of autopilot. I’m there but my mind isn’t. My mind is always so foggy and difficult to navigate through. Most of the time, I’m just mentally empty. I used to never be like this but I can’t remember what life was even like before this. It’s been like this since I was 14. I’m 19 now and I want to get out of it badly but I don’t know how I can.
