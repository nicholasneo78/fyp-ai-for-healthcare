Seeing doctor this week to talk about my depressive symptoms. Is it bad if I ask to be put on AD’s?
I’ve had some symptoms of depression for awhile (no motivation, always tired, mood changes, sadness, etc.). I’ve been pretty reluctant to bring it up but finally decided I should see someone to try and break the cycle.


I’d like to try being put on antidepressants and see if that helps me get back to feeling better about everyday life.
