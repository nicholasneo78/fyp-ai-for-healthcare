Feeling a lot worse when alone?
So I'm not sure if I'm depressed or not, maybe just too dependent on close ones. But does anyone else actually manage to feel somewhat okay around particular people, only to go back to feeling somewhat numb when alone? I'm not sure how to deal with this, but when I'm alone I'll do shit like binge eat just to feel something. Contrary to when I'm not alone, and can actually push myself to go and exercise. The snowball effect is real... but man do things feel like a struggle for no reason right now, even knowing that it can get better when socializing. Any advice?
