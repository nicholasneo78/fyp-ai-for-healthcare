Don't want to live, don't want to die.
I just want to stop existing. Vanish into thin air without a trace and wipe my entire existence off the face of the planet. I don't want anyone to love me or miss or care about me. I don't remember the last time I was actually happy and I don't see things ever getting better because they've been bad for so long. Nothing ever changes no matter how hard I try. I can't stand being alone, but when I'm around anyone I just want to isolate. I can't eat because I get sick after 2 bites. I can't sleep because I have nightmares or always dream about undesirable things. I just don't know anymore. This isn't living, but whatever it is, I don't want to do it.
