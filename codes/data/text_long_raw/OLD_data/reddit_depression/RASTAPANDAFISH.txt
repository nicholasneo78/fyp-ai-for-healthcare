Im worthless
I'm going to just assume nobody will read this like everything else I post here but here it is I guess. Im a junior in college, I've been single for 5 years, and I struggle with things everyone seems to get. I'm worthless to the world, what do I offer? I just failed a statistics quiz and went to my car and wept for 10 minutes. I don't know why. I feel alone all the time, and I feel like I can't please anyone no matter what I do. I just feel like if I disappeared the world would sigh in relief. It's not like anyone would notice me being gone. I don't have a girlfriend or anything like that, because let's be honest, what girl wants to be with a loser who has to work twice as hard as everyone else. I want to die. It feels like I'm on an island by myself and I just want to end it. Just when everything was getting better, here I am, contemplating how alone I am in this fucking world and how I can just get out.
