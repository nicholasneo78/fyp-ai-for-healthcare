Things that I liked about today so far
**Maybe the only way to escape depression is gratitude.
Cicero, one of the senators of Rome in the early days of the empire is quoted to have said "Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others."


I liked waking up early and going to the gym on an intense pre workout.

I like stepping outside in the cold to smoke and feel the warmth when I re-enter the building.

I like seeing the trees trying to survive the winter, how splendorous they are. In them I see people going through hard times and the beauty that exists within them.

I liked logging on to Runescape to escape reality for a couple of hours and talking to my friends on there. The fact that we have escapes is an amazing thing.

I liked seeing three girls meet each other outside and say "Hiiii how are youuuu?" and compliment each other. Instead of normally being irritated by that, I actually admired that people in reality share bonds and happiness with each other's presence, and it made me happy to see that.

I like the complexity of the mathematics that I'm doing and the fact that I'm doing it.

I like having a planned meeting with a group of people today for my class presentation in college.

I like having a picture of a God who constantly forgives and is deeply saddened by our unhappiness that becomes to hard to bear for some, versus a picture of an angry Colonel with zero mercy.

I like the fact that I have a place to resort to to write down the thoughts streaming from my mind.

I like the caprese sandwich I'm eating, with melted mozzarella, tomato, red peppers, pesto sauce.
