I got my first birthday present ever today from person outside of my family
So I turned 21 yesterday and today I meet up with friend and he wished me happy birthday and gave my nice bottle of Prosecco. (I Love it) I never ever received gift from person outside of my family for birthday, so I was little shocked. :)  I think my life is slowly getting better. ;)
