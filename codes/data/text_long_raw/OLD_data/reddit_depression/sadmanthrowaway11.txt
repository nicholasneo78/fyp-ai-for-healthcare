Unmotivated to be anymore
Looking at my life from an objective point of view right now I have a lot of shit to do. I have no intentions on doing any of it though. I’ve stopped solely telling myself I want to die. I don’t know if I want to die. I don’t know if I want to be alive. I don’t even really care. I’m indifferent to both options. I feel like the only thing I do care about is what people think of me—which fuckin sucks not gonna lie. I take so much offense to someone not liking me in every way, yet I’m too fucking unmotivated and indifferent to make myself better. It just leads to a cycle of people disliking me&gt;me getting sad as shit and just losing a sense of caring&gt;me being a black hole of negativity which cycles right back to the beginning. 

I don’t want to die. I don’t want to be alive. I simply don’t want to. 

I have absolutely no idea if any of this makes sense at all to anyone, but fuck it I’m hitting the submit button anyways.
