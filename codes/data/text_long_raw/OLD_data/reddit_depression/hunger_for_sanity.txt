Iâ€™m convinced money CAN buy happiness.
Can it fix everything?  No.  It would fix my life.  Money would be freedom, safety, comfort.  Money would give me back control of my life.  

As is, I make stupid little Reddit posts to feel like a person. To take control of my feelings. 

A time machine would also buy happiness.  If one existed, again: money.
