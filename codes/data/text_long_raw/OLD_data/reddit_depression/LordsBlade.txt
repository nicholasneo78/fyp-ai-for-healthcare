This planet is making my depression worse
It bothers me how unfair life is. How some people get 'lucky' and are born into decent families, live in rich countries, have good genes, etc. while others get fucked and are born into abuse, illness and poverty. I'm sure some of you know that picture of the starving child and the vulture by Kevin Carter - seeing something like that makes me feel so much worse. Maybe some of you know the stories of people like Junko Furuta or Sylvia Likens - knowing that things like these happen all the time makes me fucking miserable. It just isn't fair and it really makes me want to sign off. How can you be happy in such a world?
