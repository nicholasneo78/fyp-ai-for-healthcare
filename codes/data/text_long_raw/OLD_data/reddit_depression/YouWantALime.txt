I made a word cloud of all my depressive posts over the past three years.

This is based on all the posts on my throwaway account (this is my main account and has too many unrelated posts to sort through) since 2014.  

I think it's noteworthy that some of the biggest words in the cloud are negative.  

While going back over these posts from so relatively long ago, I noticed that most of the older ones seemed like they were written by a total stranger. If it were somebody else saying those things about me, it would be called harassment, but it was me saying those things about myself.  All in all, this has really made me realize that all the things I have written about myself are way off-base, and are only true in my mind during a depressive episode.  

I know something's wrong, but I don't know what to do about it. In some ways I'm sure I'll always think this way about myself, regardless of what I do, but I wish there were an easy way to manage it.

I used [this](https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/) word cloud generator.  
Cheers.
