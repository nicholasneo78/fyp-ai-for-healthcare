Doing things that I like reminds me why I don't enjoy doing them anymore.
Playing your favorite game? You shouldn't. Remember the time you shut yourself in just to play it endlessly? When nothing else mattered but your game?

Finished reading a cool book? Are you going to pick up another one and get sucked in again? Don't forget your friends.

Why would you hang out with your friends when they are tired of your negative attitude? Faking a positive attitude is worse. If you're going to be yourself just stay home.

Oh you got selected for a great job opportunity? Wait until they realize you're garbage at your job. 

You have time to relax now? Think again. There's always someone needing something or things that need to be done. 

Trying to treat yourself? Wait until you see the consequences from buying too many things or eating too much or wasting time.

You're actually being responsible and starting work early? Wait until you feel like nothing is worth it anymore. 

Why does it matter to do things you like if you're just going to feel bad anyways?

I've been conditioned to believe these things since I started college and I feel stuck. I'm trying to deny that I believe in these things, but the thoughts keep coming back. 

I know that I should take care of myself, but I'm so tired of living that I'm hesitant to do anything for myself.
