Why do I feel this?
I've been suicidal and depressed for the longest time. At first I could Control it and lately it's taken over my life. It's all I think about and it's fucking hell. I've lost all emotion other than sadness and depression. I don't want to do this anymore. If this is what the rest of my life is gonna be like then I don't want to live. This is my lowest point in life. I'm so lonley and can't even keep my thoughts organized. It's a mess. Please help me.
