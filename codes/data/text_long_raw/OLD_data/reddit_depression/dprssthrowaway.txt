No lodging for the sad
Being depressed sucks. That's easy to grasp. Most people who aren't clinically depressed understand this. What they don't understand is that being depressed and honestly trying to get better is extremely difficult, and our ruggedly individualistic society doesn't give a single fuck about you. You need help? Fuck you.

Your wealth isn't just something you have, it's seen as a reflection of your worth as a person. Poor? Sad? Find it difficult to wake up? Find it difficult to complete things? Do you procrastinate because of underlying psychological issues? Fuck you, you're just lazy.

The clear message capitalism sends me is that if I can't work, or I can't work enough, or I can't work doing a "high value job", or if I need help to get better so that I can do those "high value jobs", I probably ought to just go die, because I'm clearly worth nothing.
