Will I ever be with somebody?
I'm so lonely. I'm 19 and I don't have a clue what a relationship feels like. All my friends are talking about marriage and I've never even had a real kiss I cared about. I didn't think I was that bad, I guess I was wrong.

I know there are people who go much longer without finding anyone special but I really hope that doesn't happen to me. I've spent so long being someone I'm not, and now I don't know how to actually be myself anymore. I feel so depersonalized and isolated. I need someone to tell me it's ok. I have so many deep problems and I cant talk about them. I don't want sex, I want someone who can hold me and reassure me that I don't need to die to feel at peace. I just want to cuddle and talk, is that too much to ask?? I don't even care who, man woman other I dont care and still I cant fucking find anyone. I can't even find real friends. I give up, it's probably too late for me anyway. Alcohol is the only thing I have a real relationship with.
