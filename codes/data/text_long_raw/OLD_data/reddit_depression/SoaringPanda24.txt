What to do with my life.
I just turned 21 in June and I’m really understanding that life is moving at a very fast pace. I was never good in school only because I hated it and never realized how bad it would effect my future the way it is now. I moved away for college at 19 for a whole year and only passed a few classes because I didn’t care that much. I came home and decided to take the year off. In that year off I didn’t grow as a person and I feel empty all I do is sleep and play video games and go out once every two months to hangout. My parents are complaining that I have no girl friend , no life and I’m anti social. I’m not anti social I just feel so empty and lost that I don’t feel like doing anything anymore. I don’t even know if I can go back to school because of my grades were and I was lucky enough to get into school. I don’t want to move out I just want to go to school and come home as quickly as I can no friends nothing. This lack of growth in the last year has made me thinking to the point. Do I kill myself? What’s the point of living if I don’t finish school and get a job, why live if I’m just gunna work min wage my whole life? Lately I’ve been asking myself this everyday. What do I do with my life? Is there really a point in living if I don’t become a engineer, doctor, lawyer, etc ? All my friends are doing great but I’m just at the bottom and I don’t understand why they would hangout with a loser like me that isn’t even at school In my early 20s and I’m living at home. I’ve already missed out of going away for university. I really feel like killing my self is the last option I have because if not I’ll be homeless because I don’t want to hurt my parents anymore with the embarrassment of a child I am and live at home. What do I do.
