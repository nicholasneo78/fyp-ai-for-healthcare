Id just really like to have someone to talk to
I never thought i would end up posting something like this on reddit tbh. And i really do feel pathetic for doing so. 

Even though therapy is helping alot i still feel so lonely a lot and then i wish i just had someone to talk to... 
Its really hard keeping all these feelings and thoughts to myself all of the time... 

Its also not like i dont have people in my life, its rather that i dont feel comfortable enough around them to do so.
