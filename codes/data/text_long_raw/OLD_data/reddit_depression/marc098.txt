I don't want to exist anymore
My girlfriend has left me a couple of months ago, saying she doesn't love me anymore but without explaining me why. I then tried to ask her out one last time, not to come back together, just to clarify what happened. She doesn't want to see me and when I write to her she answers back just so that I can't say she's ignoring me and she continuously provokes me to get into an argument. I really had trusted her, and she had done the same, until a couple of months ago (she's always told me I was the only person who she actually trusted, even after we split up) so I feel like I've been used and then thrown away like an object.
I then realized I'm not good at all at socializing, that she was the only truly important person in my life (except for other two friends of mine, who have their own lives and whom I don't want to annoy too much with my problems) and that I will probably never know anyone else in my life. 
Every day I feel like I'm bothering other people and I'm not doing anything good, and probably this is the reason nobody wants to become my friend. 
I don't want to commit suicide, but often I find myself thinking how better it would be if I stopped existing...
