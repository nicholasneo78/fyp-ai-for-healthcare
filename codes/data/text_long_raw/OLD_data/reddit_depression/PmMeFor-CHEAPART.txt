I find the word "crippling depression" very true. But I think it's also a vicious cycle. Anyone have ever done this?
It's like you stay in bed or sit around because you feel depressed. And then your feet kind of go numb and it makes you feel worse. It's like a vicious cycle. We are supposed to be using our limbs. We are not statues.

Anyone ever tried walking around all day keeping sitting minimum? What are the effects? I'm thinking of trying it tomorrow. I will just try standing around or walking around all day in my house.
