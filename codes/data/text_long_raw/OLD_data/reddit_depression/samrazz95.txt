Recently single due to my depression and i don’t know how to feel.
I’ve had depression a majority of my life, it comes and goes a lot, but as of recently it’s really hit hard. I’ve lost all motivation to finish college and live life outside of my house. I was dating somebody for a year and half, until my depression started to affect our relationship, she couldn’t handle the pressure of it all. It’s been three weeks since the break up and my emotions are all out of wack. One minute I’m crying for my ex and the next I’m spacing out, looking at the ceiling. I honestly don’t know how to feel and how to cope.
