My Boyfriend Talks Daily About Suicide -- Won't Go To Hospital
Hi guys, I'm really just at a loss for what to do. I am absolutely gutted.

My boyfriend has pretty serious depression and is in dire need of help. I won't be able to get him in to see a therapist until next week. He has recently become quite down on his luck and he hates himself for it. His anxiety stopped him from going to work, and he was fired. He has a new job now, but he hates it as it is a factory job where he works 60 hrs/week.

 Any time I try to help him find a new job so he can leave this job, he completely panics and shuts down and I can't say anything or else he yells. It has gotten so bad recently that I dread waking up in the morning because of the psychological warfare with him. He will do things like saying he wants to self-harm, or he is going to jump out of the car while I am driving.

I have been with him for years, through thick and thin. I have had to bring him to the hospital before, and he did get better for a few months. He told me tonight he doesn't want me to pick him up from work, and that he wasn't going to come home. At this point I feel completely lost, and I know calling the police won't help.

I feel trapped and I need to get out for my own health, but I am deathly terrified he is going to kill himself if I leave. He told me I am the only thing holding him back from killing himself. I'm scared. He is such a good person when he isn't feeling this constant depression. I don't know how to get him to understand we just want to help him. He shuts me down every single day, and it hurts knowing he has given up on himself. 

What can I do to help him until he can see his therapist next week? I want to leave but I am so scared he will kill himself if I do.
