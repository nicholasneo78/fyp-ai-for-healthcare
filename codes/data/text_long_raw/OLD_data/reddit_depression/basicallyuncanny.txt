What are ways to connect to a close person who is depressed ?
I’ve been dating a girl for 7 months and I’ve notice her cycle of moving close to me then pushing me away . She gets secluded, and almost checked her self into a hospital last month but she has never really opened up about the complex feelings so I’m wondering how can help relate ? How can get her to know I’m here to listen and attempt to understand . I tell her often how special she is to me, I get her flowers at her doorstep, I show the love but recently, I’m trying to connect a different way. 

She is currently pushing me away again, so I asked to take her out to dinner the tomorrow, no response . I won’t give up on her but I want to make sure the next moves are in the right direction . I want to walk by her side thru this journey . I won’t give up on her either . So any insight on how to be a good friend during a depressed state of mind would be amazing , thank you
