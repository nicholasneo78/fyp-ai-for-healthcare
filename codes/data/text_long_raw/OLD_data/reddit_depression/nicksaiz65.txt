How can I Kill the negativity inside my head?
As I'm on my self improvement journey, even though I'm making progress, I hear a voice in my head telling me horrible thoughts. It's lowkey making me depressed.

It says stuff like "you're so shit," "you're fat so you might as well not even try with women," "your grades are horrible," "your hair isn't cool yet," and "oh so you can dress well now but you're still a shit person overall."

Even when I have an accomplishment like a successful concert or a new track of music, my jerk brain still tells me that I'm shit and not good enough. Maybe I just need to hit the iron harder and keep getting in shape?

How can I kill this voice? It's ruining my self esteem and happiness.
