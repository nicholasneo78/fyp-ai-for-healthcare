Anyone elses depression feel like this?
Good day, This might be weird but stick with me.

I suffered/suffer from depression. Basically from middle school to about a year ago when I finally started on medication.

The best way I could describe my depression is voices in my head saying mean and awful things to me, about me, about what other people are thinking or saying about me, turning positives into negatives etc. 

I started playing a game called Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice tonight and the their is a theme around psychosis, and the main character has many voices in her head. Here is the opening, (possible trigger warning?), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rob7C1lCYEI

As soon as I heard all the voices calling Senua names, putting her down, laughing at her etc. I was like holy shit that was me. I am not trying to say I have/had psychosis, I just thought that the voices thing felt like what I went through. My voice, telling me terrible things, spinning stories, like someone else in my head, working against me.

Anyone else feel like Senua/me?
