Even in objectively good circumstances I feel this emptiness
Do you also feel this empty hole inside you while doing objectively interesting things like being on a holiday or doing something with your friends. This lack of feeling is it's own kind of devastating in my opinion since you can not blame your bad surroundings for your feelings thereby losing hope and any motivation for improving your live since you will only continue having this numb feeling you always have anyway.
