The moment of clarity
I've had suicidal ideations for as long as I can remember. Despite this, I always wrote off my depression as not being a problem. Throughout my entire lifetime, my thoughts have been so warped that I just assumed that they are normal parts of the human experience. It sounds so stupid typing things out. The moment I realized that my mental illness was "real" was coming to the conclusion that well-adjusted people do not think about killing themselves on a regular basis.

And with that, came my wake up call to get help..
