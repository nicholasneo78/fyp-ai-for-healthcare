I appreciate you.
Life is a strange place.  Full of misfortune, pain and suffering.   For whomever is reading this.  You don't deserve the pain and depression that you may have.  I don't know what you've experienced in you're life. I want to say I'm sorry for everything bad that's happened to you.  Everyone deserves to be loved and to be happy.  

For those who don't have anyone to compliment you, let me be their friend. 
You are the most beautiful being I have ever seen.  You are intelligent, strong, and wonderful.  I'm am so proud of you.  You can do whatever you want. If you want be successful then I'll be here to say "I believe in you!." I'm you're biggest fan and I'll always be rooting for you. 

When I see you, I see a hero. You survived so many years of life. Nothing has fully stopped you from living your life. You've survived this long. If you think life would be better with you being gone, then you're sadly mistaken.  Screw those people who try to bring you down.  To spite them you should live your life to the fullest.  

Take a moment and try to enjoy this.  Feel the sun's light on your beautiful face. Take a nap on the earth soft grass.  Smell the flowers and enjoy your favorite food.  It's important to take a break and just take things slow for a moment.

Life is constantly going to try to bring you down.  When you fall I wanna lend you my hand to lift you back up, as l believe you would do the same for me.  We're all brothers amd sisters here. When life pushes we need to stand together and push back.  

I appreciate you and all that you stand for. When you're feeling down, I want you to stop and try to appreciate others.  Appreciate those who walk the same path with you. 

Thank you for listening to me and thank you for being you.  I appreciate you and I'm sure others do too. I hope you can find it in you to appreciate and help others.  Have a lovely day.
