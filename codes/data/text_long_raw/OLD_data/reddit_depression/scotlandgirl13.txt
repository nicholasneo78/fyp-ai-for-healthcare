Hello from Scotland
I just wanted to say hello really.

My mood has just been dipping continuously the past few weeks. I feel so sad and lonely.

I guess I'm just reaching out to anyone else in a similar position. **It's ok not to be ok.** 

I hope you are all having a lovely day/evening wherever you are x
