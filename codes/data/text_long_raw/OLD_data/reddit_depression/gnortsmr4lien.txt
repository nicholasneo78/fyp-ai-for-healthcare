I feel like I'm dead already.
Nothing gives me joy anymore, but I'm perfectly able to feel every negative emotion that's there.      
I feel like I'm wasting everyone's time. Basically it doesn't matter whether I'm around or not because I don't get anything out of it. I can't enjoy shit anymore.     
I don't wanna exist anymore. I feel like dying would be the best solution for everyone. but last night, for the first time, I felt like I could end it myself. it was enough, my emotions pushed me to the thought of actually doing it.      
I'm not afraid, I'm kind of glad that maybe there will be an end to all of this, maybe I can overcome my extreme guilt and end it myself one day.
