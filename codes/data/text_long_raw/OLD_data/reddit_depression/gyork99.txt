I feel like I haven’t done a good enough job of enjoying my childhood.
As someone who recently turned 18, I feel like I’ve started the next part of my life and given my childhood a finite end. I wish I wasn’t like that but I just feel less and less connected to the kid I was as every day passes. What’s the worst is that I feel like I might’ve missed the best part of my life and wasted my one shot to enjoy it as much as I could. Idk I really just want to hear from actual adults who have gone through something similar and know how to keep in touch with their child side. ❤️
