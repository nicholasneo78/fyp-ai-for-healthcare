I thought I'd share two quotes that I liked/felt I could relate to.
I don't know why I feel like sharing them here, but maybe somebody can take something away from them. They're both from Emil Cioran and his work *The Trouble of Being Born*.

The first goes as "It is not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself too late." 

The second goes as "What do you do from morning to night?

I endure myself."
