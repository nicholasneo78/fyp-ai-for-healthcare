My grandma is dying and life doesn't stop
So I work full-time and go to grad school part-time. I'm busy 7 days a week between work, class, and homework/housework. Normally this is a very good thing for me as it keeps the depression and other mental illness at bay.

But my grandma's dying. She was put into hospice over the weekend and can't do much of anything anymore. I love her so much as my grandparents/mom's side of the family have been the only stable family I've ever had. My grandmother is an amazing woman. She graduated as valedictorian of her college class. She raised 7 amazing children (all college grads and successful in their fields) and has 14 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. She's 90 and has lived an amazing life.

It's still so hard to say goodbye. I've been doing my best to spend time with her and my visiting family but the grief and depression are kicking my ass. I can't do anything. I have a huge paper due this week and work has been insanely stressful. I can't even manage to get my laundry done and I'm buying and eating shit food that is bankrupting me.

I don't know what to do. Life won't stop, and I'm so stressed that my whole body is breaking out in rashes and I'm sore all the time. I don't have any time off work since I haven't been there long and we're already short staffed. The end of the semester is coming up and I can't even think much less write a policy analysis.

Any advice is welcomed.
