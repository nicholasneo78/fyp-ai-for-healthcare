Happy birthday!
Anyone else hate being sung happy birthday? it feels almost sarcastic  at this point. I know i should appreciate that i have people in my life that want to celebrate that kind of thing, but wearing a obviously fake smile to attempt to hide how messed up i feel inside get's very tiring, very quickly.
