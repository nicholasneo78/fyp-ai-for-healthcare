I'm sorry for the life I chose, I just want another chance
I regret every decision I've made in my life, like to list the off not in order of reason or value to me but just randomly. I have really bad teeth because I just drunk alot of fizzy drinks and didn't take care of them. Secondly this was because of that but I because shy and anxious all the time thinking about what people thought of me. So didn't make many friends in school. Then during school my attention gravitated towards video games and my grades became shit. Therefore felt like university wasn't an option for me. I was taking to this girl I liked and she didn't seem to bothered about my appearance more my personality but she was interested in someone else. I got really attached to her and ended up losing her and a good friend because I became too attached. I regret all of this 10 times over if I could relive my live I would regardless of the emotional scares and events that I went through
