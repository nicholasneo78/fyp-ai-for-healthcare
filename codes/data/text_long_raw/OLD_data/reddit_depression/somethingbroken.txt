Why do I feel like I don't know myself anymore
I keep struggling with depression and I feel like it's stripping away all the things that make me... me.  I used to be a good student, used to write stories about adventure and life, used to play sports, used to enjoy hanging out with friends and now I'm nothing.  I've been losing parts of myself until all that's left of me is misery.  All I feel like doing anymore is laying in my bed and staring at the ceiling or if I'm feeling particularly bad I cut myself.  What happened to me?  I try to be hopeful but... that gets exhausting
