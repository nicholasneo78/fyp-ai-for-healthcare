I can't stop crying.
My mom is one of the only people in my life that cares about me. We just fought over stupid shit and I feel so alone. I just broke down, and she doesn't know how to help. She locked herself in her room. I'm so alone. I want to die to bad. All I do is work and sleep all day like a zombie. I can't take it anymore.
