Torn. Need advice...
Hey Reddit. I am not sure how to start all this but im going to explain to my best ability. Here goes. So, i have i had depression and anxiety give or take 3 years. I recently opened up about it to my girlfriend and she encouraged me to open up about it to my mother. I told her about almost everything. The one thing i did not mention to her was the... suicidal thoughts. Now, for our family “feelings” isnt our thing. We keep everything closed up and then repress it all. Thats what i have been doing for years not just with depression but everything. Now, these past three days have been brutal on me. I had no want to leave my bed or eat or even sleep. I just lay there and listen to music. I have been having suicial thoughts here and there these past three days. I will have happy moments here and there. But it doesnt last (shocker) and i just go back to feeling like pure awfulness. So, I am a 17 y/o male and I start senior year in August. We are a military family. My dream is the military. Thats all i have ever wanted. I want to follow my brothers footsteps because he is a total badass. All ive ever talked about to people, when they ask me what i want, to do is how badly i want to join the military. I do not think, with my current mental state, that i should go to the military. But i also fully believe that if i dont go i will disappoint everyone around me and they will be disgusted in me and i also believe that i will fall deeper into this dark hole i have been in. I have come to ask you guys, Any ideas on what to do? I am taking a cross country trip in 2 weeks with my brother and I will ask him some things about this and hopefully it will clear my head. 

Thank you for reading.

I forgot to mention. I want to go get help. get put on medication. But the military doesnt accept people who are on anti depressants. What do i do?
