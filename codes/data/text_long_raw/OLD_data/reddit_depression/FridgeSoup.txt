Suicide is a constant thought though I dont feel a desire to do it
I have people who I care about and who care about me and I know deep down that Id never consider suicide a valid option but it seems that I can't help but constantly think about it throughout the day, every day. Is this something that leads to the actual act or is it just being in a dark place? I feel so apathetic and when Im not totally numb I feel like there's this pit of sadness in my stomach that Im trying to digest. I dont think I genuinely smile or laugh anymore it's all just reflexes so my family doesnt have more to worry about. I feel like i cant tell people how I am because were all struggling so hard to stay afloat and stay strong for each other and piling more misery on seems like the wrong thing to do. Not sure if Im even looking for answers but it feels good to get it all out of my looping brain
