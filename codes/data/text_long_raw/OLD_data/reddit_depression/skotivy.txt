I haven't felt anything in over a month.
I have struggled with depression for a few years now, and I was doing really well. I met a girl online that seemed absolutely perfect, and she made me feel truly happy for the first time since I was little. In October, she just stopped replying to me. She sent a message a few weeks later faking to be a family member and lied about committing suicide. I just feel nothing anymore after that.
