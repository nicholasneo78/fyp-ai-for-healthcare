Is there a place on the internet that actually helps?
This subreddit is flooded with depressed people. The few that do comment, usually only agree with the OP.

Random articles are usually unhelpful. They all say get healthier, socialize, be productive, see a therapist, and/or get medication. 

Iâ€™ve tried all that.

Just wondering if there is anything, and I really do mean anything, on the internet that is helpful for depression.
