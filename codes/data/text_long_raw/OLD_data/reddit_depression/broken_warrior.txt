Ever get to that point where you don't care anymore
I'm 18(F) and I live with my partner and his family 18, my parents have been kicking me out since I was about 14, but my mum kicked me out a few days after New Years and told me she didn't want me and I was better off dead.... I was a carer for my mum I look after her. I've been placed on antidepressants that they've been trying to place me on for years but couldn't because of my age and I've not spoken to my mum in almost a month but she phoned me last night and I thought it was to sort it but it wasn't she was phoning to tell me that I'm to pick up my stuff otherwise it's going to charity.... everyone says it's better I don't stay with her anymore but I don't know part of me wants to no matter what pain my family cause me. Is it because I love them or because I don't know any different.  I feel like I'm running out of options to stay a live... I don't know what to do anymore... I give up and I don't know what to say or do anymore.... maybe this is how it's meant to end...
