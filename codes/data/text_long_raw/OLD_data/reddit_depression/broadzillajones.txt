You are all such beautiful people.
Flood my inbox with your life experiences. Your random daily thoughts. The things you want to say but hold inside. Your favorite song at the moment. Your favorite song from when you were a kid. What you used to do. What you struggle with. A meme that made you chuckle. Anything. 

Businesses help each other every day. Why can't we?

I've been feeling more alone than I've ever been. Let's Skype. Let's text. Let's not be so dogdamn alone anymore.
