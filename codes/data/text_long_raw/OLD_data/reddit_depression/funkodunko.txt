I have severe anxiety and suicidal ideation
I have no motivation to do anything. If i dont go to work im in bed all day. I have no desire to text friends or do things i used to be passionate about. All i can think about is how much of a loser i am because i haven't applied to any colleges yet (i graduated in may). I see on social media people going out and having fun and i look at myself, im never out of bed. The only time i shower is when i go to work or go run errands with my mom. I am physically and mentally exhausted.
Another thing, I have severe anxiety about posting on social media. Ill muster the courage to post a selfie and then delete an hour later. When i have panic attacks i delete my profile picture, bio and everything i posted that is a picture of me or i think people will judge me for. I keep thinking that my friends are just talking about me behind my back and actually hate me. These thoughts get so overwhelming that i start picking at my skin where i think there's something "wrong" about it and pulling my hair out. I keep cutting my hair, too. Its only two inches and it used to be down to my elbow. 
I keep thinking it will be all over if i just walk outside onto the freeway or swallow some pills. The only thing stopping me is that i can't get out of bed most days. I cant handle being myself anymore and i dont know what to do
