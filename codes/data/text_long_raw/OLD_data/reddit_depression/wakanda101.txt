Describe your depression
Here is how I would describe mine: I live an exceptionally fortunate life. I am a college student interning for a commercial real estate development company. I had two internships last summer, one in venture capitalism and one teaching middle schoolers how to code. I have a potential internship lined up for a Fortune 500 company in Miami next summer and potentially an private equity internship lined up. I have all the networks and connections in the world to be successful. But I feel so unhappy and miserable with my life. My thoughts are so irrational and negative that I can't see how fortunate I am to have all that I have. I make great money with my summer internship, more money then most adults make, but none of that matters, because I still have suicdial thoughts almost everyday. I feel hopeless all day, everyday. I feel unloved and unwanted. Even though I have more than enough to be grateful for, I still feel inferior and lower than the lowest of the low.
