Today I realized I don't have any friends. Not really.
This weekend I was going to go to a Harry Potter symphony with my two aunts. One of them and my grandma, who all live together, got sick. They gave me the three tickets. They told me to go with friends,  but they don't want to chance getting me sick or no one staying with their mom. 

Fair enough. As I was driving home from work today I was thinking about who to take, and I came up blank. No one came to mind. I have my roommates, but I don't really talk to them much and they all have girlfriends that they hang out with all the time anyway. Even the ones I went to high school with. I realized the other day when they mentioned it in passing that they had started a new DnD campaign with a new guy. I'm never invited to dinners or anything anymore. We never make a big ass meal together on Saturday anymore. Honestly, I don't think they'd even want to go anyway. 

There's no one else I'd ask. Everyone at work is either dating someone or I don't know them well enough. I'm taking online classes so no one there either. I don't do anything outside of school or work. 

I don't even have any friends to take to this fucking symphony. Not even one. I identify more with the characters in the books I read than with anyone I know. I don't know what to do. I feel so alone. I'm not even that close with my family, not really. Not well enough that I can even really talk about my opinions and especially not my emotions. 

The therapist I saw about a year ago kinda threw me off as SAD and said it'd get better. I just dunno what to do.
