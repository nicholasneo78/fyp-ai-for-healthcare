I want to get help, but I also don't
I don't want to stay like this forever. If I do I'll end up killing myself. I don't know what to do to get help, given that, while I live on my own, I'm not on my own health insurance and I don't want my parents involved. What if I did get help? The doctor would probably run me through a variety of medications that could have bad side effects. I read one time about a guy who basically lost his sexuality because of an antidepressant he got put on. What if something life-altering like that were to happen to me? I'm afraid to risk it.
