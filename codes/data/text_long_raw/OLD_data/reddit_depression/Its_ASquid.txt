I'm the person everyone refers to when they say "There's always someone worse."
Extremely stupid; embarassing myself on a daily basis with my poor IQ and lack of understanding anything.

Lost a VOLUNTEER job because I am an idiot and kept screwing things up, and everybody wanted me gone.

Can't control my own pet dog, in too much trouble.

Financially in a dangerous situation.

Unable to find a single thing in life I'm good at, and therefore enjoy.

Forever single due to my weird nature and orientation.

Losing connection with family members due to my questionable morality.

Cannot find work that will suit my long-term heart and breathing issue.

No motivation to do anything anymore.

Cannot do basic tasks. I can't even lace my shoes properly.
