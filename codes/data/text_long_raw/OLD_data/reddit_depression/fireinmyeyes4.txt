"i had nothing to offer anyone except my own confusion" Omegle chat with stranger about life
You're now chatting with a random stranger. Say hi!

Stranger: enjoying?

You: yes funny video

Stranger: o's all day

You: how bout you? are you coping with life by smoking?

Stranger: its vaping lol

Stranger: and nah

Stranger: just something to do

Stranger: but slightly coping i guess

Stranger: i had to quit smoking weed for a drug test

You: so why do you think you're a weak person? why are you empty inside?

Stranger: i dont

Stranger: and im not

You: why aren't you?

Stranger: im full of nicotine rn actually

Stranger: i have people and things in life

Stranger: dont feel lonesome

You: if you were suddenly paralyzed and had no value to give in life, would you still have friends?

Stranger: yeah probably

You: wow that's good. i think all mine would leave

Stranger: damn

You: therefore, they aren't friends

Stranger: im sorry

Stranger: thats true

Stranger: i live with my twin brother

Stranger: so hed have to stay with me

You: hmm ok. would you rather have many friends or lots of money

Stranger: friends probably

Stranger: money goes away

Stranger: friendship doesnt

You: friendship does too

Stranger: yeah but in a more natural setting

Stranger: thats just life tho

You: i guess the only option we have is to meet our doom and continue with life. the only other possibility is to jump off of the highest building in the world

Stranger: exactly

Stranger: suicide is kinda pointless

Stranger: life is all we have

You: haha so why don't you choose the second option?

Stranger: id rather hit rock bottom then have no conciousness

You: hmm how old are you?

Stranger: 19

You: wow u look 30

Stranger: ik its the beard

You: u bang alot of pussy?

Stranger: not a lot at once

Stranger: but ive had my fair share

Stranger: and a kinky bitch rn

You: nice, u trust people?

Stranger: to an extent

Stranger: i always have a backup plan as to not rely on them for happiness

Stranger: if you always have yourself, and youre okay with that, then you will be okay

You: how are you okay with that?

Stranger: well longterm you can always just meet more people

Stranger: short term you need to be okay with being alone

Stranger: because youll have to eventually

You: what if you had no arms or legs? what would u do?

Stranger: id have to probably have a caretaker

Stranger: but thats situational

Stranger: and if i do end up like that im not sure how id be alive after

You: let's say you're fine somehow, but u live in poverty and have no friends or family

You: now do u still live?

Stranger: i mean thats more of a situation where suicide is more reasonable

Stranger: idk how ud do it tho

Stranger: id dprobably just go into a homeless shelter or something

Stranger: by rolling?

You: haha

Stranger: hopping?

Stranger: not sure

You: ok, but wouldn't u be extremely depressed and miserabl all the time. how could u find joy in such an existence?

Stranger: hmmmm

Stranger: youd probably learn to cope

Stranger: either that or id attempt to get pain meds

Stranger: and mauybe od eventually

You: no but how, like all u can do is sit around. maybe watch tv or go outside and watch birds fly and shit on your head.

Stranger: yeah i guess just be okay with your existence how it is

Stranger: but suicide is still more likely honestly

Stranger: im okay with m life because i have all extremities lmao

Stranger: you caught me

You: haha. idk how to be happy fuckin hell

Stranger: like now?

Stranger: are u depressed

You: yes and lonely and insecure

Stranger: hmmm

Stranger: where do u live

Stranger: couintrywise

Stranger: country*

You: usa

Stranger: oh nice

Stranger: how old?

You: 21

Stranger: do u do drugs

You: not anymore

Stranger: did u have a problem?

You: no just wasn't for me

Stranger: gotcha lol

Stranger: do you workout?

You: yes

Stranger: hmmm

You: i do almost all the things your "supposed" to do to cure depression and loneliness. but i can't get it out of my mind and i am not sure what to do anymore

Stranger: hmmmmm

Stranger: well

Stranger: do you try new things?

Stranger: like random ass things

You: yeah, so i get temporarily happy for sure. but long term it just fades away and im back to being miserable

Stranger: maybe its just a loop of thoughts?

Stranger: like anxious/depressed thoughts

Stranger: also do you live alone?

You: yeah

You: no with my roomates currently

Stranger: that could be some of the lonliness

Stranger: oh okay

Stranger: idk i kinda view life as a thing which you might as well have

Stranger: even if things are shitty

Stranger: because once you leave you cant just come back

Stranger: so you kight as well experience evrything you can experience

Stranger: even if it sucks

Stranger: cuz some things dont

Stranger: and those are worth living for

You: hmm ok. i guess accepting how life is has been the difficult part

Stranger: very understandable

Stranger: humans created a system of working and living on less of a survival mode, which has created so much boredom

Stranger: like living isnt that hard, so what do we do now?

Stranger: but that allows us to do many things other animals cant, but its still kind of dreary

You: yes indeed. that's very true

You: it's hard to know what to do

Stranger: it really is

Stranger: too many options

Stranger: have you taken acid/shrooms before?

Stranger: brb

You: yeah

Stranger: true lol

Stranger: acid kinda showed me how crazy all these manmade systems and schedules we all live for are

Stranger: like theres no reason we have to work in the morning/day and sleep at night, besides circaidan rythem of course, yet we all do

Stranger: but yeah idk i promise youll feel less depressed as time goes on

You: maybe. im concerned i will lose touch with society.

You: i can easily see myself living on the street haha

You: idk how to stay engaged

Stranger: living on the street because of not having money, or another reason?

Stranger: and you dont have to stay engaged with society a lot, it will always be there

You: just not giving enough of a shit to keep going

Stranger: just having whatever social circle youre comfortable with is enough usually

Stranger: true

You: also brb

Stranger: gotcha

You: so yeah what is your last piece of advice/Last words?

Stranger: id say just keep going, if things seem bad now just realize how many times youve reached a breaking point in your life, for whatever reason, and that youre still here lol

Stranger: also, just keep trying new things, and doing whatever, because what does it matter anyways?

Stranger: and if you seriously feel depressed, consider going to a doctor/therapist, as there could be less serotonin in your brain that the average person

Stranger: is that helpful at all lol

You: yes, it's nice to hear someone else who has thought about these things. and who can give an honest opinion

Stranger: i believe in u man

Stranger: u still there?

You: ya

Stranger has disconnected.
