Depression-induced forgetfulness is threatening my relationship with my family. Need help urgently.
I forget everything, especially the most important things. I forget appointments, I forget items at the store, I forget how to do things, anything that can be forgotten, I forget. I don’t mean to. There is some kind of block in my brain that’s screwing that up due to my many disorders. However, it’s being interpreted as apathy, especially by my parents—they’ve had enough of repeatedly reminding me to do things, and I’m an adult, and they need to concentrate on THEIR lives and what THEY need to do, particularly to help my thirteen-year-old sister blossom now. So this needs to stop. What can I do about this? Medications, cognitive therapy, anything else? I need to save my family ties and my future before they’re completely destroyed.
