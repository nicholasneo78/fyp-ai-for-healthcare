I think I'm having a nervous breakdown
I've struggled off and on for about 10 years with anxiety and depression. The latter half has been mostly on. Recently my psychiatrist changed my medication from Zoloft to Effexor because the Zoloft had pretty much plateaued and then started working less. I don't think the Effexor is having a very good effect on me. My depression has been worse than ever. On top of that I found out that my dog has bone cancer and likely won't live more than 8-12 months. She's only 6 and she has been my entire world since I adopted her and she has helped me through a lot of difficult times. Because of these things my moods have been very bad, and I had to leave work a few days ago and I haven't been back since, and I'm pretty sure they're going to fire me because I'm still new. Although the job was adding to my stress because they failed to tell me that we would be working mandatory overtime EVERY SINGLE DAY. I don't have much of a support system. My mom is pissed at me about work, and I'm living with my grandfather who just doesn't get it. I don't really have much in the way of friends which is I guess why I'm ranting on Reddit looking for some kind of support. I don't really know what to do. I'm going to call my psychiatrist Monday to set up an appointment and hopefully get off Effexor. I want to find a job that is less intense than this one, and less hours. Hopefully part time. I don't know I just need some support/advice/anything.
