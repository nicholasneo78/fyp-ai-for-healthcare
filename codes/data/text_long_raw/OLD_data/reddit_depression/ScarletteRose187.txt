Anyone wanna just distract each other from depression for a few minutes with a good convo?
I’m 20f. I am so bored. I have absolutely nothing to do. I’ve been so depressed lately that I’ve pushed everyone away. Everyone’s asleep right now anyways and I’ll probably be up all night again... so, if anyone wants to talk all night, I’m perfectly fine with that!
