Honestly, i don't know if it's worth it anymore.
I wake up, there's only fucking trouble and chaos around me, all of my family members are suffering from anxiety and depression, things only look worse by the day.

My dad told us how he doesn't care if he dies tomorrow on christmas eve... i don't know, maybe this post is coming out as confusing or chaotic but the reality is...

I don't know if it's worth holding it or living anymore, i'm not suicidal but i need to fucking vent, 'cause i'm fucking going crazy, i cant fucking sleep at night, and when i do, i feel fucking sad the whole fucking day. 

I fucking hate myself.

All this shit because we can't fucking return home, and we're here because is ny fucking fault.

Fuck this shit.

And every fucking time im around people i just dont know why i put on this fucking mask, a fucking emotional mask, i pretend like im happy and im having fun when really im fucking dying on the inside, im tired, im fucking tired of living, im tired of money, im tired of problems, the only thing i want right now is a pack of cigs and absolute silence and peace.

So there, there is my fucking rant.

Sorry for all the "fucks".
