Tried to kill myself last night
took 60mgs Kpins and 30mgs Lunesta. This isn’t a story about how grateful I am i’m alive. I’m legitimately pissed i’m still here. i don’t have friends, i hate college, and my anxiety is so high I can’t leave my house without feeling judged. i just want a way out of this hell i am trapped in every day
