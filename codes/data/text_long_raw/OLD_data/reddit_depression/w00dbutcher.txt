No end in sight
How does a person continue on when it's one shitshow after another. I'm supposed to be strong for my wife and kids, but at what cost. I'm slowly returning to self medication with drugs and alcohol. How do I help my daughter deal with her problems when I can't cope with my own. I'm supposed to be the rock, but Jesus Christ, I just want to disapear.
