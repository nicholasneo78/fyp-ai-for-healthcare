Afraid to post my own comments/opinions on social media.
I'm just realizing that all of the social medias I have or use (IG/ Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit and so on) I only repost/like other users posts and rarely post my own.. Idk seems like I'm afraid of what others think of me and that I'm insecure about something
