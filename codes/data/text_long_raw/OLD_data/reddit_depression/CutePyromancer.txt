I think I'm dropping out of college
Been depressed for a while and I'm currently on medication and about to start therapy.

Last semester I missed a lot of my classes and made everyone in school worry, managed to save the semester with good grades thanks to some amazing teachers and the new semester just started but I don't think I can do it. I stared missing class again and everything just stresses me out so much. I don't even know if this is what I want to do with my life, but I know my parents really want to see me with a degree and I don't want to disappoint them (also I'm terrified of telling them)

God I hate this feeling, I'm really freaking out right now. I don't know if what I want to do is right, maybe it will make things worse, maybe I'm just a lazy horrible student.

Right now I'm just gathering the courage to tell my parents, I know it has to be today. Anyone else in a similar situation? Any thoughts or advice?
