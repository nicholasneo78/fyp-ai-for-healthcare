People are NOT who they seem.
I originally wrote a long post detailing the specifics of what just happened to me, but I decided not to. All I'm saying is, **don't** trust anybody. You have **zero** assurance that people who act nice and fine when you're around are really nice and fine towards you when your back's turned.

I wouldn't have known the true, judgmental, and frankly I have no fucking idea where in the ass of God did they pull all their judgmental shit - if I hadn't snooped and read text messages of my mother to other people. Hell, my own mother's in it, too!

"Hide the knife, he might stab our son (my stepfather)." "You're sick, go to a doctor for a checkup. You can't give up, please don't die. We pity your son. He can't survive without you. He'll burn all the money with booze. He'll be homeless and sleep on the streets."

Jesus Fucking Christ. What in the actual fuck? I don't even drink. Jesus Christ. What the fuck. The judgment. Dear fucking Christ I could not believe nor comprehend how this people even came to whatever bullshit thought/idea they came to.

Suddenly, I'm back down to self-doubt and I can feel depression clawing at me, it's trying to rip me apart again. But, no more. I'm pushing it back. I've confirmed EVERYTIME, that family is my main source of toxicity. FUCK THAT.

I'm being ganged up on by everyone in this house, and their relatives, and every single one of my relatives. I once questioned if I was the one at fault. I mean, if EVERYBODY hated you, you're probably doing something wrong. UNLESS, you're just that damn unlucky and every single one of your relative is a fucking asshole. I've heard of those stories before, so it isn't impossible - and I think that's the case with me.

Jesus. For now, I'm playing the game they wanna play. They wanna be fake with me, I'll be fake with them. I act all fine and dandy around my mother and everyone else. I smile, I joke. All a facade. So when the right time comes, when I can finally burn bridges with them, **it will fucking hurt mom.** Mom, yes. Because everyone else would be glad I'm gone. But, my mother, will hopefully finally realize her fucking mistake and die a fucking failure of a mother.
