I don't know what to do anymore.
I've been with my boyfriend for almost 10 years, since we were 16. Things have generally been awesome, but the past couple of years has just consisted of a giant blow-out argument once every few weeks, generally stupid shit (me complaining of not spending enough time together, him not contributing to chores, him complaining of not enough sex) I don't know how to talk to him about our problems without him getting angry and breaking objects and me getting insanely sad and just not being able to communicate as my brain just goes "YOU'RE USELESS! WHY HASNT HE LEFT YOU YET, USELESS FUCKING CUNT". I just need someone to talk to or something. i dunno
