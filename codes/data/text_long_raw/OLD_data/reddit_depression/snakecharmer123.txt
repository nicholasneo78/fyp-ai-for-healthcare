All of my friends annoy me
I try to hang out with ‘close friends’ because I know it’s meant to be good for me. There’s probably about 4-5 people I’m close to. These are all good people who I’ve known for years, who I can be honest with about my emotions and mental health, who genuinely do care about me. On paper they’re amazing. And they are.

Only I find that whenever I spend time with a friend, they end up annoying the shit out of me. Each one for a different reason. One talks about herself too much, one is too positive and gushy, one only ever talks about the past, the other only wants to hang out and drink. When I’m with them, I just find myself wishing I could be alone.

I know the problem is with me, and that I’m sabotaging my relationships (as I always do and have done for many years). I feel guilty about it, especially knowing that I’m lucky to even have friends. But the truth is, I find people exhausting, and whenever I’m with them I just feel lonelier that when I’m alone. I end up getting snappy. It’s like I’m watching myself destroy my relationships but I don’t know how to stop. Hanging out with people makes me unhappy. Beginning to think I should become a hermit out in the woods on my own. 

I don’t know why I posted this. I suppose I just want to tell somebody.
