Nearly finished high school somehow
And it’s weird because I don’t have a plan for my future because I never expected to make it to the end of high school. Why plan for a future you have no intention of experiencing? And now I’m stressed because it looks like I’m going to finish high school and idk what the fuck to do with myself.
