Is this it?
Is this really all there is? There is no escaping the struggle of human existence to just simply die and it's all gone to time? Moments of happiness are fleeting and never last. Pain stays with us for longer. Pain and chaos happen to all people. Suffering is a widespread human emotion. Why do we put on a masquerade amongst each other? Why put yourself through an existence of pain?

How many lives have been lived in pain and died in them? Nobody asks for an existence, it's thrust upon you. What you do with it makes you who you are, but what life does to you typically makes you live an existence of either easier happiness or rolling agony.

God it's such dirty bullshit.
