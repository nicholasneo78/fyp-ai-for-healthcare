I was so happy last week.
I spent a week with my long distance boyfriend for our anniversary. It was the happiest I'd been in weeks. I knocked a few things off my bucket list, like casinos, a septum piercing, and walking barefoot in the gulf of Mexico. 

I was so, so unbelievably happy.

Now that I'm back home, I'm back to being just as despondent as I was before. I'm cold and distant again. I don't want to talk to anybody. I'm back at work, in a horrible job with horrible people. I don't want to talk to my mom because she doesn't get it and it feels like she can't be bothered to try. 

My boyfriend is amazing and supportive but I know this is putting so much strain on our relationship. I'm trying so hard but I feel so stuck. 

I guess you could say that I'm not doing too great.
