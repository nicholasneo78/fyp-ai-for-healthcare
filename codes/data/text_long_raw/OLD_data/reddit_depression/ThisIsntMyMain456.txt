Being told by my brother making friends isn’t that hard for someone my age bothers me every time I think about it
It’s pretty damn hard when I have no hobbies to relate to anyone except stay in my room on my computer because I’d rather just be away from everyone so I don’t make it hard on them. 

And being told to go to clubs by my parents. I just feel more of a disappointment when I tell them there’s nothing I’m interested in and that I also am too afraid to still be alone when I join one. I’ve done everything I could in my life to try to fit in or make new friends, and there’s a reason why I have no motivation to try any of these anymore. And then they say it wouldn’t hurt trying. That couldn’t be any further from the truth. If I try to fit in again and still don’t have anyone to talk to, I’m gonna hate my life even more. It’s like I’m trapped. I can’t do anything to please me. One day I want friends, then the next I don’t want anybody at my school to bother me because I know they don’t really want me to be there friend. 

Why does depression always put you in a trap that you can’t get out of? There’s no solution except accept your problem and just be an introvert and ignore everyone.
