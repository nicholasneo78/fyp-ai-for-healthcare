I often ponder the idea of giving up completely.
Has anyone given up completely? How does it feel like? 

I have had extreme depression for 11 years. For as long as I can remember I have tried so hard to stay alive. There was a point in my life where I gave up. I remember my mom was beating me and I put up my hands to block the belt and I was crying. I remember after one of the times she struck me I started to think “what if I gave up?” And I just shut down. In that moment I stopped putting my hands up, stopped crying, and rolled into a ball while mom kept beating me for a few more minutes. 

For a few years after that I stopped caring about my appearance. I got so fat and I just kept eating and eating. I stopped caring about my grades and didn’t even try. I would just turn in a blank paper with my name on it. 

During high school I woke up and started to try again even though it was really hard. Since then I haven’t stopped. I regularly do thing I don’t want to do in an effort to make it by. I get up at 5, I shower every day, I go to the gym, I do my homework, study, etc. 

Currently, I have been working my butt off to be able to join the military to get away from my parents. My depression is acting up so much, it’s getting really hard to keep trying. I often find myself daydreaming and pondering how good/easy it would feel/be to just stop what I’m doing and give up. Get in bed, stay in bed, go eat, eat some more, and more, finally not caring about my appearance and just not doing anything in general.
