Just another night.
Another night of feeling lonely and just wondering what I did wrong in life to deserve this unhappiness. I’ve never felt a pain stronger than being rejected by the love of your life. The person who gives you a purpose. The person who is supposed to make everything better. You would give your life for this person and they just don’t love you anywhere near the same.
