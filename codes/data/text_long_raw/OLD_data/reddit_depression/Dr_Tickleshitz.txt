I miss the days where I at least had depression sleep to look forward to.
More of a vent here so bare with me. I have not had a good night of undisturbed deep sleep where I wake up feeling refreshed in years. Like, I kinda autopilot through my day trying to ignore how nothing really excites or motivates me and that I've stopped progressing towards any dreams or goals, and the more I'm awake the longer I have to struggle with that and I don't even have sleep to look forward to. I used to be able to sleep through anything and for many hours at a time. It was awesome. Idk, just like I'm riding a vicious cycle of depression worsening sleep, sleep worsening depression slowly downwards to the point where I think not existing would finally feel like the best damn rest I ever had. 


Anyway, thanks for reading and stuff. Felt good to vent a little.
