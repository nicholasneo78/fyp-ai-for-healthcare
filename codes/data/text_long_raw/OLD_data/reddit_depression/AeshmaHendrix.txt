How to find friends
I know I probably sound extremely pathetic but I just dont know how to find friends that like the stuff I like. I live in germany, so metalheads dont just Hang out in the skate Parks, in General i rarely see them. I cant go to concerts to meet them because most of them are 18+, and I am not 18 yet. There is a concert I want to go to so bad, but cant because of that. And I am really sad because all these years I tried being friends with people completely different, and all it did was make me more depressed and feel like I was a mistake. Clubs are 18+ too. I really dont know what to do, because I just once want to feel like I belong somewhere into a group of people. I sound so lonely and desperate I apologize
