Try to stop identifying with your thoughts
Dude, I know how it is to be depressed. I know how it is to be sick and tired of being sick and tired. Tired of the hate, tired of being tired of the hate, tired of being tried of being affected by the hate.

But what has worked for me and helped me rarely have SA or A these days was focusing on my breath when a thought comes.

Im 1 year and some months in since i started to liberate myself.

Currently im numb because of anti depressants and possibly supressing so many thoughts in my young life.

But i felt peace, i felt pleasure. So I KNOW those are real.

Just try. What do you got to lose?
