What do i even do
I'm just laying here, crying. I have a broken heart. I have voices in my head constantly yelling at me. I can't get her out of my head. I just want to feel okay and feel loved. All I do is try to be as nice and sweet as I can be, all I do is try to treat everyone respectfully and be as good as I can be, but all I do is get used, abused, degraded, yelled at, I fucking hate it. Someone just love me. Just make me feel wanted and okay and happy fuck
