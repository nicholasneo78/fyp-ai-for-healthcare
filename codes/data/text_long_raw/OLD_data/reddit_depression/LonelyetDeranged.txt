Fuck my father!!
I don't hate him anymore for giving me a rough childhood,I don't love him either,instead I pity him.He has gone through a lot of hardships:losing a brother,going through a nasty divorce,having a sister with a chronic illness,finding out his first born (me) is a necrophiliac,then going broke...

But he is making my life a lot harder when he doesn't acknowledge my pain.He yelled at me saying that BPD is bulshit,it's a fantasy,that depression is just a joke.

Now he wants to throw my meds because he believes it won't help me at all.I am to scared to take actions against him.He makes me want to kill myself even more to prove that he is wrong.**I.am.not.fine!**
