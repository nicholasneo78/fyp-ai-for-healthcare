Does anyone else feel insanely angry when they see injustice against others? Like I feel like I seethe with rage when I see others being mistreated
Every time I watch the news about the political storm in America or anything I see in my twitter about police brutality or slavery in Libya, etc. I seethe with rage. I can't stand seeing so many people being tortured financially, mentally, physically. I hate it. I feel powerless and I feel angry. I feel like my depression grows with other people's pain. The more I see injustice, the more powerless and worthless I feel in the world.
