I keep filling the void with unhealthy relationships
I am so frustrated with myself. In the last 3 years I feel like I've burned through so many relationships. Some I've dated for 6 months and some for only a few weeks. Everytime I get close to a guy friend they end up wanting more from me, relationship-wise. I have such a hard time saying no to people and I just try to make shit work because I get scared of losing them. It's never really the same after you've dated or tried to be more then friends. 

I just want to stop filling my life up with these people, trying to make myself feel better in the moment. I keep craving what happiness they give me, because I'm just so fucking tired of feeling like a sad, unless piece of shit all the time. It's  an addiction and it's ruining me.
