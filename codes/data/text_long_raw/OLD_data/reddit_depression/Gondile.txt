stupid poetry
Cast down, cast down.

Walk straight but with a frown.

Don’t ever think twice about it,

Make them laugh, you’re a clown.




Cast down, cast down.

You’re not worth a thorned crown.

Don’t tie a noose but tie your leg,

Jump the pitch, dive deep and drown.




Cast down, cast down.

Annoy them till it’s a ghost town.

You’ll drive everyone away, you know?

And then be surprised when no one’s around.




Cast down, cast down.

Watch the seconds, it’s a countdown,

Until you crack and have a breakdown,

Because everything makes up a meltdown,




And your emotions shutdown,

And you’ll sit there,

And know,

That you are,

A letdown.
