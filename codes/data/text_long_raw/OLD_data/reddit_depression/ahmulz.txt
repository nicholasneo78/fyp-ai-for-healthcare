I don't know what it's like to be not depressed.
Hi my name is ahmulz and I'm depressed. 

Been depressed arguably since I was 15 (25 now). Looking back on my childhood, I can definitely see some signs of childhood depression. The past year has been particularly bad in terms of my mental health. 

I'm better than I was a year ago. I've joined a gym. I do pole dancing. I got a cat. I have a therapist. I'm medicated. I volunteer more. I see occasional good things in myself. I'm not actively suicidal anymore. Yet... I'm still depressed. I've changed my life so fucking much and I'm still fucking depressed. I still have more work to do to "fix myself" (fucking diet, fucking exercise, bullshit mindfulness) but it all just feels like so much goddamn work at the end of the day. 

I don't know what I'm working towards. I can't comprehend a world in which I don't wake up in an apartment that needs to be cleaned because I'm too tired and too lazy to do it or that I don't spend my time in a numb, self-loathing void. I don't know how people get through their days liking themselves or liking their life. 

It's frustrating and lonely. 

There are some days where I wish I was suicidal because the rest of my life wouldn't feel so long and full of drudgery. I can't see me getting well. I just can't.
