Making friends...
Literally one of the hardest things ever. If you haven't found a group in middle school, you literally have to make friends with everyone in the group. And then, entertain them and convince them you're interesting for literally a year on end.

Then, I imagine you have a shot of getting invited somewhere. I'm not a fucking magician, I can't keep you entertained consistently for that long.

And these people never reciprocate the effort you put in because they have a group and you don't. I gotta work 10 times as hard because I didn't get lucky in middle school like these guys...

lol...
