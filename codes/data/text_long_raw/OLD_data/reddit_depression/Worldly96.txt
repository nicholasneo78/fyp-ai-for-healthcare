Feeling numb...?
Has anyone else reached the point where they realise that they were emotionally numb in the past or still are now? Last year, my grandfather passed away and it was a sad time for the family. I was upset, but no where near what I think I should have been. I still have a hard time getting truly excited about things that should be fun, like going back to uni and seeing friends etc. 

It's hard feeling to describe. Dazed or aloof maybe? If I do feel any emotional intensity, it's anger or irritability.
