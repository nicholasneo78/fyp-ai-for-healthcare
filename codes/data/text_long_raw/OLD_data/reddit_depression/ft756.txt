Ending my life if I turn 18
Things around me had become less interesting. I've become so bored to the point I just don't wanna live anymore. I want to change but I realized I am just being a hypocrite so I'm ending it. I did not learn to love myself nor anyone. I asked advices from acquaintances but their advices are all the same and day by day I've become more depressed and I did not tell anyone about it anymore because what's the point? 

I wanted to live for my family but thinking I'm dealing with my mental illness alone is hurting me and its just too much....

Should I really end it?
