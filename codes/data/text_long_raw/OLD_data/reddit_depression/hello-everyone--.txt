How do I get confidence and motivation?
Anyone else not accomplish anything in their life? I'm a loner, loser, and I don't fit in anywhere. I'm only 17 but I should have done something with my life by now. Never played sports, never got a job, never had real friends, never had confidence just anxiety (I believe this to be a major factor that prevents me from doing things). Stay home all day on PS4, no motivation, no happiness, no passions, and no dreams. Most would say they look forward to getting out of high school yet I'm the opposite. I don't look forward to the future. I don't want to go to college although I probably will anyways, and I don't want to work a job I'll hate. I'm a lazy shit and I hate myself for it.
