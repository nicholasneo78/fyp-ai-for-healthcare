Please someone read this, i've been holding so well since my dad died but now...
I feel like killing myself is sooner or later inevitable.

I came back home from my boyfriend's house because I think I should spend some time with my mom. My dad's death made me speak what I feel and even stopped suicidal thoughts. But today.... I decided to be honest about few things unregarded to my dad.  Now mind you, me and my mom has always had rocky relationship and I would never tell her much. 
Now I reminded myself why... Since my dad died I've been honest to her about my limits towards me seeing his corps the day before burial and I've been crystal clear that this Saturday I didn't feel ready yet to go to the cemetery and I assured her that I'll surely go one day.
An hour ago she told me that me telling her all of that is avoiding all those responsibilities. I'm shocked, I feel hurt, I feel anger and... Hatred... 
One of my coworkers told me "don't do anything you have no strength for, don't push yourself, everyone grieves differently". She's the only person that understands me... I will talk to her tomorrow because she will understand. She's such a kind person...
But not... I feel so weak and I feel like sooner or later I will kill myself because that's too much, I have no one to realistically help me besides good words. I feel like now there's nothing that will hold me. At least i want to be understood by someone. I won't get it from mom, I feel like I won't get it from boyfriend. 
Im too tired, I really am. Please someone believe me. I have no where to go, nowhere! Please.
