I could really use some reassurance that my life is worth living.
I took a chance last year and despite depression I reached for a goal, which was me taking my first full-time job in the field I went to college for. This was supposed to be my big redeeming moment, the big change in my life. But it's been a few months at my job now, and things aren't going super well. I'm facing the very real possibility of total failure. If you can take the time, I could really use a message of encouragement, or if you'd like to share your own story of taking a risk and failing and still being okay in the end. I'm so upset and anxious right now. Thank you in advance everyone.
