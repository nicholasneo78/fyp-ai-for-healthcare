Feel like I have no right to feel this way
People have it worse than me, while I, a privileged man with a loving family, cannot feel most of the time. 

I hate using the term “depressed”. Even as I’m writing this, I feel like I want to delete it. It’s being thrown around so much lately that I feel like I’m just being a little bitch that uses it like I don’t know it. 

Have been seeing therapists for months, talking to them and trying to find a way on how to see life differently. Thankfully I’m not prescribed any of those fucking pills, because my current therapist is smart enough to know they aren’t the best medicine for me. 

Whenever I feel joy, it lasts for a minute, then I’m back in my own dark world. Very dark world. I think about suicide, screaming at people, wanting to beat some people up. Then I lay down, and feel guilty for thinking about such horrible thoughts.

Sorry for the rant. Today was a shitty day and I had to let it out somehow...
