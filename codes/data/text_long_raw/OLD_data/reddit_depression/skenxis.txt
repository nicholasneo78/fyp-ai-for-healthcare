The Beauty In Community
Hey guys I recently started a new Instagram account (@skenxis) based solely on forming an environment and community for people that struggle like myself, my dream for this account is to have a very active following that doesnâ€™t even have to be big I only wish for people that take time to look at my posts, talk to each other in the comments with support and even dm as Iâ€™d be willing to sit down and talk to anyone of you. It would mean the world if you could like or follow. ðŸ–¤ -Josh
