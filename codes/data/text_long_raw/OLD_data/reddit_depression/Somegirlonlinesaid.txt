Do you ever wish you had a god to pray to for guidance?
Because I do. Whatever’s out there, if anything, please fucking help me. Give me the right words to say to my boyfriend to get him out of his slump, and please keep me from drowning myself.
Please give me a sign or something. Anything.
Amen.

Now I finally know what The Script meant by “just praying to a god that I don’t believe in..”
