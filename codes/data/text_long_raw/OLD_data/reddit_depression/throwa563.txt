I starve myself
When I get depressed, I just can not eat. Everything sounds so gross and eating just seems difficult. I’m a very small person, 5’4 and 100 pounds. It’s something I’m self conscious about but weight gain has always been a struggle for me. I’ll go through periods where I’m doing well and eat 3x a day and manage to put on a few pounds, but then something happens and I slip back into my old ways and the weight falls right back off. Does anyone else do this?
