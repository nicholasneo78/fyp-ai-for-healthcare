What’s wrong with me?
I have an amazing family and an incredible group of friends. The support is there and they’ve tried to help in the past but I can’t burden them with my troubles anymore, it just feels uncomfortable. 
I’ve seen a three therapists in my life each no more than two times. I’m not sure why I can’t just get myself to keep seeing one consistently. 
I’m waiting on grades from summer school but I’m fairly positive I failed and will subsequently be kicked out of college. I’m 23 and still have over year left to go. 
I don’t know where to turn. I don’t know how to move forward. 
I can’t sleep at night and during the day all I want to do is lay in bed. My productivity is at an all time low which is saying something, trust me. 
I feel like I’ve lost it. 
I think I hate myself.
