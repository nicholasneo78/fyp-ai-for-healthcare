Anyone else feel guilty about people checking up on them?
A part of me feels happy because its nice knowing people care about me.
Then I realize they’re only doing this either because of 1.BellLetsTalk or 2.Because they know im depressed and they would never do this if I didn’t tell them I was
I just feel like it’s sort of fake in a way even though I know they care.
