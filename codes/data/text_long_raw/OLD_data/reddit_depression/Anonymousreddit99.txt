I feel alone
Hi I'm writing this here because I feel as if I have no one to talk to but it's occurred to me that I'm never truly happy with my life.. I'm 19 a male at that I've seem to never be happy as hard as try to be it never goes as planned.. I have no idea the root of my problem or problems I've tried a number of things plenty of options were given and I'm just getting deeper and deeper in a hole. I'm in a house with my mother and my sister but I feel like I'm in everything I'm in alone. That's what I hate the most . The loneliness
