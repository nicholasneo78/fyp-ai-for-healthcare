This beautiful weather is making me 100x more depressed than I already am.
I suffer from crippling depression, lack of confidence and no self esteem so it’s not like I can go out and about and meet people just like that. I’m craving human interaction but I don’t know where to start about gaining back those qualities. It’s so nice out I just wanna go hang out with someone and shoot the shit, take pictures of whatever, get dinner and drinks, do outdoorsy things, skate, anything but all I’m gonna do is go home and mope and cry about how shitty my life continues to be.
