I got laid off but my coworker that stole $1000 didn't.
I was a new sales person at a dealership. I was very sick and went into work. My boss dismissed me because I sick and told me not to come back until I was better.

Later today I got laid off because I didn't text him that I was sick the day after. Which I thought we established that I can't come back to work until I felt better.

Meanwhile the financial manager stole $1000 and the boss didn't fire him. 

I can't believe what happened.. its been making me upset and eating me up. I don't talk lots and everyone at the dealership liked me. I always work my hardest in my little desk of mine. I guess my hardest wasn't enough.
