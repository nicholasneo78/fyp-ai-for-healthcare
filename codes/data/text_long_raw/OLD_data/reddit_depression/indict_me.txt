today is my birthday :)
Today is my birthday. 8th alone. 22 today, a number that i never would've thought i would reach. I bought some of my favorite snacks and got my old blanket, just going to watch some of my favorite movies today. I also bought a card for myself ( which i do every year) , written on it was "Happy Birthday, Love mum and dad"... they were the last people to ever tell that to me and i know that even tho its been over a decade since they're gone, they were the last people to celebrate and be happy because of me, the last people to love me. i miss them so much. I get so lonely, its hard to cope sometimes, i wish i could spend more time with them. I love you mum and dad :)


EDIT 1: Thank you all so much for the wishes, it really means a lot. this is the most i've gotten in years. Really made my day, been struggling to cope especially in the last few months, everything is just hitting like a train so thank you to all! Wish you all a good day :)


EDIT 2: THANK YOU SO MUCH TO EVERYONE! You are all such awesome people. I cannot express how thankful i am and how this has been my best birthday in years, i feel like a kid again. i have not smiled more in the past years. It brings tears to my eyes to receive so many thoughtful messages and support, all of you are just great! Hearts of gold. Thank you. Thank you. 

And to everyone in this subreddit I've finally found my bit of happiness, all thanks to you! I no longer feel alone, and you shouldn't either! Theres so many good people here on reddit. Hope you all are coping and hope you have a great day!
