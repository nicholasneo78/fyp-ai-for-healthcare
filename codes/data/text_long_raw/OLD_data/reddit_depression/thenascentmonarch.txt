I do want to live...just not like this.
I remember when I used to be so happy at the world. Full of opportunities, believed that you could be anything you wanted, yadda yadda yadda...

But it's as if reality hit me with a shovel and said "no! you can't be happy. Be sad."

I can't stand how much of a failure I am, and how mediocre I am. I'm the ugly friend and women ignore me. Online dating is a joke. I hate my body with a burning passion. I'm bad at everything I do. Every attempt to feel positive is met with a "no! you can't feel like this, and here's why". It's like my brain is set to the "negative" setting by default, and I can't change it. Then I just give up and let myself succumb to the self-hate.

Just wish I wasn't so damn shit. Wish I wasn't ugly. Wish I had a body I was proud of. Wish women didn't look down on me like I have the plague. Wish I had something to be proud of.
