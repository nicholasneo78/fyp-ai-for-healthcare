What's wrong with me?
I just want to know what's really wrong with me, should I get help or something...I often think about myself like I'm a negative person. Some people describe me as cold as I don't really have any genuine reactions to anything just pure neutrality some even say I lack empathy. I keep most of my feeling and thought for myself and the only thing that's wierdly funny to me is dark humor and misfortune of others. My attitude on the outside, most of the times, is "I don't care", but when I'm alone, then shit goes down, anxiety, depression, dark thoughts you name it. I can go days without seeing anyone or speaking to anyone when I'm in this pit of my own making. But then again, I still have this slight need to socialise after some time. The thing is, some time ago, one of my closest friends asked me, what made me happy, when was the last time I was truly happy? And what worried me, I couldn't think of anything, still after thinking for like an half our, there was nothing. Don't get me wrong, I still laugh and sometimes even smile, but for me positive and happy people seem fake. Anyone in a similar situation? Some advice would be appreciated.
