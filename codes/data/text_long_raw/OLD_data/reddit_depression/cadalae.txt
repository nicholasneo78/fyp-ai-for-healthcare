I felt happy the other day and now I'm worse off
I went on a date the other night, my first one in a very, very long time. It went surprisingly well and the guy was really sweet and understanding. The whole date I felt the overwhelming sense of loneliness I struggle with disappear. My mind was clear and I was able to be quick witted, funny, and upbeat. I was happy for the first time in ages.

Now that it's over, I feel worse off. I forgot what it feels like to not be crushed by depression and all the shitty things that come with it. The depression has seeped right back in and it hurts more now. I should be grateful I was able to escape it for a moment, but fuck no. 

I almost wish I didn't have to be reminded of what normal felt like.
