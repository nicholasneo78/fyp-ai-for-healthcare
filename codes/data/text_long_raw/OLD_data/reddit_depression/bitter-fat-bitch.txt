Will I ever feel beautiful
I lost alot of weight, went from a size 20 to a size 10/12 uk size and I get told I look good. 

Guys who approach me forget me when they see how broken I am inside.

"No one will love you if you are unattractive..." my family looks like the cover of a magazine and I look like shit.

I hate myself, I just broke a mirror and my hands are bleeding. Please when will these emotions pass? Should i save up for sugery? Will i feel beautiful then? Why does my sister look like a model, my bro too 6"4 and attractive.

Guys used me to get to my sister and girls used me to get to my brother. Someone please.

Like me for me and tell me looks don't matter. Please get to know me. Please.  Please.
