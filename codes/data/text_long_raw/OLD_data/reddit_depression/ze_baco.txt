Hey reddit, give me one moment.
Take a deep breath.

Release yourself of your roles and see yourself as a person dealing with other people. Take a moment right now, take a deep breath and appreciate how there is so much effort taken in making the world as it is. We harnessed the elements and made the surface of the world a little more enjoyable. Sit back and enjoy all this hard work.

Strip the world off from labels. People do not mean to be good or bad. Remember that after you acomplish (or not) all your goals we are still people living with other people.

Remember today. Take another deep breath, if you are comfortable, close your eyes. Appreciate whats around you, good or bad. Maybe the day is really ugly. Remember again that it is on around its own business. Do not see it about yourself, but instead look at your role in the big picture.

Have a smile. You deserve it ;)
