Want to cut but can’t
I promised my girlfriend I wouldn’t self harm but last Friday I tried but I started panicking because I remembered what I said and she would see the cuts. I gave her my box cutter on Friday and today I started looking for something else in my room and I don’t have anything. I’m going to my schools counseling center with her today.
