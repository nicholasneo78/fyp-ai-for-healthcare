I don't know how to go about this.
Hey. Im Tomm. 
Ive had a fucking miserable time in the last 21 years. I havent been happy for the last 11 years and when i finally am happy and get into the swing of it, it fucks off and leaves me to suffer. Rant; for the last 10 years my dad has had cancer, hes not well at all. It seems im the only one who gives enough of a shit to help him. I wouldve moved away and had a life by now, but ive stayed purely for him. Last week i realised hes manipulating me to get anything he fucking wants. The girl ive been chasing for 6 months that i fell in love with has just fucked me off. Long story short about 3 months ago she had a 2 year anniversary with a guy but admitted she has a thing for me. So i waited it out and about 3 weeks ago they broke up so i thought 'hey, ill see if i can hang out with her and see what happens' nope. Told her i still feel how i did and she just says 'i see you as a friend and nothing more'.
Maybe im just not cut out to be here, or to deal with people?
Ive had a fucking terrible time, people to chat too would be nice.
