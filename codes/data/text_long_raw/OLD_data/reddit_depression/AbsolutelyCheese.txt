My dad died today
So I’m 16, coming on 17 next month. 

Today my dad died at 42. 

He hasn’t been doing so well for a few days. Yesterday his legs gave out and he was stuck on the bed with his lungs in pain if he lay on his back. For 24 hours, no sleep, food, or drink. Many more problems that I cannot remember, and he’s been feeling like shit emotionally too due to family issues. 

My mom went to check in on him before going to the store. Since yesterday she’s been trying to get him to go to the hospital but of course he’s stubborn. When she came back from the store, she decided she’d have the ambulance come and pick him up because he REALLY needed to go in. Slurring his words, despite actually being sober in the mornings. When she went back to get his consent over phone to get picked up for the ambulance, he was out cold already. Lips purple, cold, lifeless. It had been only 30-40 minutes since she last saw him, alive, or whatever was left of his life. 

I was there to see a fresh dead corpse. 

My dad. My *dad.*

To say my world is crashing around me is an understatement. I’m just a fucking kid, going through my own battles with myself and now my dad is just *gone.* I didn’t have the best relationship with him but he was a really, really good guy and this stings like a bitch. 

All of it feels unreal and at the same time scarily real. 

Everything is numb. 

I’m lost.
