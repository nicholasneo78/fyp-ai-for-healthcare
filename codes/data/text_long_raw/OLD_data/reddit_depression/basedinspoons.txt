Are any of you on agomelatine?
Currently on 30mg/mirtazapine a day, which is ok aside from how hungry and sleepy it makes me (I understand that they can be desirable effects for some people but not what Iâ€™m looking for).
I read a bit about agomelatine and it appears not to have those side effects but I wanted to know how real people have experienced it before asking the doctor to prescribe it.
Thanks
