It’s not some fucking sadness anymore. This is madness.
I remember when I just had a few days when I felt sad and out of it. And I would worry but then everything became better a few days later. Still, I went to a psychologist, because my downs were too consistent to be considered normal.

It all went downhill from there. I feel like I’ve lost a part of myself. My personality, my identity, whatever. I feel like when I talk to others I’m not “there”, like I’ve lost control of what I say and think. Like I’ve lost my mind. Like others are normal and I’m in my own world, going through life on automatic mode, not knowing what I should think, say, or do. Even though from outside people might say I’m completely normal, even sometimes better than before, I feel like mentally, inside, the world is going down. My life is crumbling. Like piece by piece I get further away from a solution. Things that seem to work for others don’t work for me. 

I hate it. It’s not just a “bad mood” anymore. It’s feeling like I’ve lost my way, and there’s no signs to get back. Like a loop I can’t get out of. That’s why suicide comes up as an option. When you’re stuck in a loop, the only solution is to shut off. If sleeping is the only thing I enjoy, then why won’t I sleep forever? Fuck that shit
