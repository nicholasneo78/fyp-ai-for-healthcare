Well, it's been a year now since I tried killing myself
A year ago on December 1st I tried to kill myself. I spent a week in a psych ward and have been on lots of meds and doing lots of therapy since then. The therapy has helped quite a bit, I've slowly learned how to listen to myself and how to take things one day at a time. As far as meds go, my anxiety is much more controllable and my sleeping meds actually work (mostly) so I can't complain too much.

I don't think I'm ever going to overcome depression. I've kind of learned to live with it, sure, but beating it probably won't happen; I'm way too cynical to beat it. It's just how I'm wired. There's a lot in life I probably won't get to experience because of how I am. And I still don't know how to change that, or at least make some good out of it.

I guess what I'm trying to say with this post is, I'm not sure if I'm happy or not. It's the not knowing that bugs me. I know I'm better than I was a year ago, but I still feel lost, and I don't know where to go from here. Every day is just a haze that I trot through.

Sorry for the rambling. Have a good night
