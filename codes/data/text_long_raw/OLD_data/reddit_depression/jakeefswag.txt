Reminder that it will get better.
Everyday I get home from my part time job, I cry for at least half an hour before I get up to go inside and finish the rest of my day.

Everyday I feel and believe that things just keep getting heavier to deal with. That my life will not become healthier and I won’t ever be happy. It’s one issues after the next, or all at once and I keep wanting (sometimes do) push it off to the side.

Everyday I also remind myself that it will get better. Sitting here alone, sobbing my eyes out while texting this post, I don’t believe it in these moments, but I’m not giving myself any other choice/exception. I will beat this and be happy.

Depression and anxiety and all that jazz can suck the fun out of life in seconds. I want to remind you all that even when you really don’t believe it, keep telling yourself you’ll be happy and healthy. I want all of you to, you deserve that at least.
