I just feel awful all the time
I feel like im suffocating all the time. Sometimes idk if i really have depression because i dont think im like guilty of anything i just feel so tired and i dont want to do anything,  i get easily irritated and i hate everything,  sometimes i get so overwhelmed i dont know i feel like im drowning, i know i supress my emotions i know i do but i can't express myself anywhere and i have no one to express myself to,  i feel bad for telling my friend whenever i feel bad because she has it worse and she doesnt really know what else to say.  I feel exhausted all the time.  I face animosity at home and at my dorm i feel trapped and i just want to give up on everything. Sometimes i wish my bus gets crashed into, sometimes i feel like flinging myself across the street, sometimes i feel like screaming and sometimes i feel like sitting and not do anything,  i hate school, i hate my house, my family hates me my mom suffocates me, i hate everything,  i feel numb towards everything but then i want to cry all the time,  sometimes i just want to lie in bed and waste away but i can't i have to go to school,  im not even sure i like my major, sometimes i just feel like i shouldnt even be here liks my existencs doesnt even matter so what's the point im not special im no one i do nothing i just want to start over, i can't drivw cause im afraid ill purposefully get into a car crash to just end it. I just want to be at peace, my mind keeps racing and most of the time idk what im feeling i just don't know. I want to be saved but i dont have anyone and i should save myself. But idk idk
