I really need help making friends
I'm 25, living with my parents. I recently quit my job, hoping to ease my depression but it only made it worse since I have nothing to distract me now. I lost touch with all of my high school friends after graduation, and didn't make any friends in college.

I spend my days walking my dog, reading wikipedia articles, youtube, etc. I haven't spoken to another person since Monday. I just stay in my room and my parents don't come in. I don't have any hobbies, not even video games so I don't even have "online" friends.

I have no friends or anybody to talk to. I realize this isn't a healthy lifestyle, and that I'm a loser. But I want to change. How do I meet people and make friends? When I meet people, what do I talk about?
