It doesn’t go away with love.
Depression continues to exist even when you think you have found the love of your life. I look at my partner and see the sun. I am looking through foggy lenses, though. Some days I feel so lonely I can’t stand it, even while holding the hand of the best person I have ever known.

I am experiencing a wonderful relationship. I am being filled with light and love and I truly feel as though I’ve hit the jack pot. But, for some reason, my depression is working hard to make sure to hide my own happiness from me.

I wonder when this will end.
