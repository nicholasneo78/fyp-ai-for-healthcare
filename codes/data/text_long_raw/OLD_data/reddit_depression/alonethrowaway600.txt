People think I just want attention if I bring my depression up
What is the point and why is wanting attention so bad anyway? Who would not want to be told that they matter and that everything will be fine? If I wanted attention so badly why would I pretend to be depressed? Why not just make up a happy story about my day instead of risking sounding like a psychopath?
