Sad all the time and abusing many drugs to try n stay alive
Hi, I've had depression n anxiety for a few years now, had ups n downs but mainly downs, it's got to the point where I use weed, md, xans, ket n alcohol to fill up the holes.

I honestly wouldn't be alive without the drugs pulling me through, I've even started using my prescription pregabalin (lyrica) to get a buzz too ( taking enough to get high)

I barely talk about my feelings I feel so isolated from my friends and the mask is slipping, i want it to slip in a way so they see the real me.

I've been trying to open up more but it's so fucking hard to do that, I've got to the point where I don't care, don't care about my life or feelings I don't care how I die, I don't care how long it takes I don't care what method , hanging , OD, drowning, train, fire  it doesn't bother me.

I don't want to be me anymore I don't want my life, I know that life is shit and throws stuff at you but I can't handle it, my anxiety is so bad I don't open the front door or answer phone calls even if it's my friend.

Myself and my mental illnesses have put me in a deep hole and I can't get out by myself, the thing is it's not just me I have many mental health professionals helping me but the thing is I've got used to keeping the mask on, white lies, they don't know the full extent of my problems.

I really don't know what to do I'm lost and reaching the end of my patience, I'm thinking of doing it I have methods but just need something to instigate it....
