I used to be so creative, and funny
I used to enjoy writing, drawing and making people laugh. Now I'm just a shell of self hatred, and constant doubt. My social skills are out the window, I'm always awkward. I used to write short stories, and I haven't done that in several years. My drawing skills haven't advanced since I was a teen, which is is sad because if I had continued drawing, I would of been a lot better than I am now I bet. :/ I'm trying to slowly build up my artistic love by using adult coloring books, and doodling models. 

I've become so engulfed with my appearance (I have BDD and anxiety and depression) that I completely abandoned all other parts of my personality that made me special and interesting. 

I used to be so quick witted. I was always the funny friend, and I loved it.

I hate how I am now.
