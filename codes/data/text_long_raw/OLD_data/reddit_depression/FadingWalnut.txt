Reddit sucks, and I’ve decided to delete it.
Anytime I go outside the depression sub my opinions and comments are just shitted on because I’m not the same fake moral high or smug asshole that most other people on reddit seem to be. “Oh you have a non leftist opinion? Fuck you then!” Like seriously this is reddit front page in a nut shell and even any smaller sub Reddit’s there’s still a bunch of assholes everywhere. I come on here in an attempt to aid my depression but even on this sub, though allot of people are nice and kind and I really appreciate everyone’s kind words, it’s not helping me and I’m just gonna stop wasting my time. Tata fuck you reddit. Depressed sub people you guys are aight but fuck everyone else.
