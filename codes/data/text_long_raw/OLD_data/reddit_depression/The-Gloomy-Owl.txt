I am Helpless
I’m only 14. My brain has stopped trying. It’s like my brain can’t comprehend anything anymore. Be it science, language, history. I can’t comprehend anything. When I read about these subjects, I just feel like I’m staring at a piece of nothing. It worries me because I think my apathy in life is going into my studies. I can’t help not comprehending what I learned. I have an iq if 115 but don’t feel like it. I feel robotic when doing my work and can’t feel emotion. It’s like my logical brain died with my emotional brain. Now I’m an unemotional, unintelligent human that is comparable to a zombie. I feel like a mindless idiot now that I can’t understand story’s. I am beginning to feel that my brain has died preventing me from formulating thoughts.
