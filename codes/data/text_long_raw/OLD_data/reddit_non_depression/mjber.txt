What's wrong with this friendship?
I need some thoughts on this situation.

Three friends of 20 years decide a month a head of time to go to a Gatsby Party for New Years Eve. All of them are single. Well, at least one of them is somewhat single. The less-single one is Charlotte. Charlotte has a new beau, who she has been seeing on the low for about two months. Melanie and Jenny can see that Charlotte is smitten. Ok, no big deal. All is good. "Do you, girlfriend! Just don't lose yourself". (Names have been changed)

So everyone is planning for the NYE party. Melanie and Jenny have their outfits ready to go. The dress that Charlotte ordered is not going to be in on time for the party, so the back-up plan is to go the mall and find a new dress. Melanie goes with her, and Charlotte, reluctantly buys the best dress she can find, but it is not nearly as fabulous as the first dress she ordered online - which, again, won't arrive on time.

The ladies planned to all go to Melanie's house early on the day of NYE to slowly get ready, play some good music, eat pizza and have a few drinks before they summon the Uber to take them to the party.

The night before, however, the party's promoters announce on facebook that the venue has changed to another location. A little aggravating, but not a big deal. They decide they're not gonna let that mess up their NYE and want to have fun anyway.

Anyhow, on Jan 31, at 5pm-ish, Charlotte sends a group text to the other ladies:

Hey ladies, i know you'll probably hate me for this, but I'm not gonna go. I wasn't feeling it since they announced the change of venue and now James asked me to go to Vegas. So I rather do that. I apologize for the late notice".

Needless to say, the other women were very upset.

Any thoughts? Should the other ladies accept that?
