Trying to make me jealous
I once asked some friends about where they get one of their "items" and they both seemed to shrug it off, laugh and basically show that they don't want me to know. I thought wow ok didn't expect it from friends but I guess some people are petty about some things. And they knew that it got to me a little that they didn't tell me but whatever. Now they would bring up the topic of this "item" here and there knowing how they treated me regarding it. I have strong suspicions they are doing it to spite me or prod me to give a reaction or just to reinforce their "dominant" position. They probably get a kick out of it. The problem is, I don't know the best way to react to it when it's brought up in convo to show that I'm not envious or jealous. And I'm not jealous of it at all as I actually found out what I needed to through other means, it just bugs me that they think it does and so I don't want to give off that vibe so they can go into a private convo and laugh about it.
