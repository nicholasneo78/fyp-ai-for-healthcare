My daughter is entitled and ungrateful
Last weekend my 21 year old college daughter fell and was taken to the hospital via ambulance. We got a call from the hospital and my wife and I drove 4.5 hours to spend the night with her in the hospital. While there she had to go to the bathroom but called a nurse because she had to use a bed pan. Just before she went she asked us to leave the room and my wife and I refused because we wanted to get a cute photo of her on the bed pan to post to Facebook and compare to a baby photo of her when she first learned how to pee. She got very upset and called the nurse and told her to remove us from the room. This upset us, especially my wife but we tried to keep out composure until she was released from the hospital.  We dropped her off at her apartment and my wife spent the 4.5 hour drive home crying because we can't believe how spoiled and selfish our daughter has become.
