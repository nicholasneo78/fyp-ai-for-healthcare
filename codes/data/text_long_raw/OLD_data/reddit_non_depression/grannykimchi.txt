My mom has changed since marrying her new husband.
I’m a college student, still living at home with my mom, going to school and working part time. I help pay some bills, I help around the house and do errands when I can. Since this new guy moved in with us it doesn’t feel like a family anymore.

When they do grocery shopping he writes my moms name all over what is HER food. This never happened before and I really never even touched her food to begin with so I find it really rude and unnecessary. 

When they buy dinner, they bring back food for everyone except me. (My younger brother lives with us too). And they tend to go out to dinner without asking if I want to go. 

I don’t know, I’m venting but I’d also like other people’s opinions on this. Is it normal or am I right to be feeling like I’m unwanted?
