Should we be angry at our parents for forcing us to suffer through their deaths?
People always say "no parent should have to bury their child", yet our parents didn't care that by having us, we'd have to bury them and suffer through their deaths. This is selfish, and assumes love only runs one way, as if sons and daughters cannot have a strong love for their parents. Shouldn't we be angry at our parents for only being concerned with their own suffering?
