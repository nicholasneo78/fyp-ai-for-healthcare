21/F/US Looking for a long term friend
Hello! My name is Mousey and I live in Georgia. I’ve been very busy with school, work, and starting my own business. I’m looking for people I can have serious connections with. I used to have a best friend in the UK whom I talked with every day all day. So, time zones don’t really bother me.

I have an open mind, and I love sharing thoughts and ideas with people. I love learning new things (and since I have an awful memory- you can teach me the same thing three times and I’ll be excited every time lol)

I am currently studying to be a middle grades teacher in the fields of science and social sciences.

I also have a chinchilla and a hedgehog. They’re wonderful babies and I’ve had them for a long time now (they’re my heart)

I am pretty blunt and open to receive and give advice. I really want someone who i can share my daily life with, and they can share theirs with me. Funny pictures, goofing off, hard experiences we encounter, the whole nine. I miss having that connection with someone.

I’m not looking for a specific gender, age, or region. I just wanna spend my time and experiences with someone who will become special to me!(:

I’m not sure if this helps or hurts me here- but, I’m not really into anime or gaming (I thought I would throw that in there because of the people on here seem to enjoy those things) A lot of people also tend to be into computer science, and that’s okay! But, I’m going to tell you now that I’m pretty technologically impaired so I won’t be able to hold a conversation about it with you :P

If you’re okay will all of these things then just shoot me a message, I can’t wait to meet you!(:
