How do you make friends in your thirties
I am currently at a time in my life where I am finding myself almost friendless in my city. I live in a big city and most of my friends have moved away over time or lost contact. I live with my boyfriend, so I do have him and my family. But sometimes you just need a female friend to talk to, I am feeling quite lonely.

So my question comes, how do you meet new people and make new friends at 30? You can't exactly ask someone to play like in the schoolyard in kindergarten - that takes on a whole new meaning these days.
