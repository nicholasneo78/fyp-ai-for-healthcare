A good friend who I feel is brushing me away.
I used to like my best friend(she did not know I like her) but she was involved in a relationship ( a long distance one). Around early October, I stopped liking her but still talks to her like nothing happened and still acts as a good friend and recently, she broke up with her boyfriend. I don't know why but by the way she chats with me through the phone, its like she is putting me off or just ignoring me but when we meet f2f, she acts like nothing happened, so what should I do? I feel like waiting it out and act like nothing happened is the best way to go about this
