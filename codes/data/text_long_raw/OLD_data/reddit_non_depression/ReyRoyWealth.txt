Why is it so difficult to preserve wealth within a family for longer than one hundred years?
Some family members can make fortune during their lifetime. Because they were lucky, or because they worked hard, or smart. It doesn’t matter. It is almost inevitable that after two generations passing the lucky one the third generation returns to the poverty with very poor financial background.
There are always and always will be more failures than successful stories.

Why is it happening?

Because of mismanagement.
There are no other reasons!
Not because they are too old, too young, too tall, or too stupid…
But, because they failed to create a system which can monitor, rule, manage, predict future successes and failures.
Most families have no idea that such systems have been existing and successfully helping some families to do this job efficiently.

Do those families share this knowledge with humanity?
No way. Why would they do that? They literally rule the world, they have all the power and all the money.
I’m fortunate to collaborate with some of those families.
What if I ask you:
Would it be interesting for you to uncover their secrets and to know how they do it?
Would it be interesting for you to see a blueprint of their success?

Many families are struggling in our society.

They have no idea where they are going to and what goals they have. 
It leads to frustration, procrastination, apathy and depression. 
Because they have been caught in a daily routine. Day after day, month after month…
No time to think, no time to plan, no time to review or set goals.
In my opinion, this is the reality for 99,99% of the human population of the Earth.
Is there a solution?

Yes!

But, you have to implement some strategies.
It includes not only intellectual, emotional and spiritual development, but financial evolution also.
Without a strong financial fundament, it is almost impossible to cultivate wealth in your family in a long-term run.

To be continued.
