Reddit, need your help on restoring friendship
Hello there, dear redditors. I truly need your advice and every opinion is highly appreciated, so feel free to express whatever's on your mind. I'll try to keep things as short as possible, so here's the problem. I know a friend of mine since we were 7 and now i'm 23. Recently (for a month or two) i started allowing new people in my life, which is pretty unusual for me and it got so overwhelming and intense that i didn't notice i started building distance with my best friend because i concentrated on new people too much. Eventually we got so far from each other that we barely even talk. We still respect each other and are chatting on occasion trying to look like we're still those "good old friends", but i can tell that he's not okay with the situation, even despite he's trying not to show me that. I know i fucked up big time. He's my best friend that has always been there for me and i won't forgive myself if i'll lose him. So, reddit, what do i do? I know it would be the best just to tell about the situation, but i can't find proper words and it pains me. Thanks in advance.
