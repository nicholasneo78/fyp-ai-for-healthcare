Family Vacation. Is this rude?
My fianc√©' and I are headed to a family vacation at an amusement park for six days with his family. There's no set schedule, except for one family dinner and one family breakfast.  Everyone is in different life stages, so it was best to let everyone venture off on their own.  I figured we'd coordinate events and rides with folks once we got there but nothing set in stone. 

My cousin lives there, about 25 minutes from where we are staying and I haven't seen her in years since she moved due to bad timing and life events. We were going to go meet her for dinner one evening (probably about an hour or so) during the trip. 

Is this rude?  I mentioned it to my MIL and she didn't look happy and I felt like she was biting her tongue. 

My MIL and FIL are paying for the whole trip, but they wouldn't be paying for this dinner.
