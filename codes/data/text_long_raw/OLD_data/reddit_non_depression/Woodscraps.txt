How to help my mom make friends?
My parents have had a rocky relationship since I've known them, some times worse than others. Over the years, my father's caustic conversationalism and other factors has caused my mom's friendships to fade away. She's been quite depressed in the past couple of years, although in a slightly better frame of mind lately. 

They're in their 50s and recently had to move 2 hours away from their longtime home for my dad's work, and my mom is rather isolated. 

How can I help her make friends? They live in the country and can't really even get internet at their house right now. My dad has mellowed slightly with age, and is *generally* well-intentioned but clueless as to how this affects her and what she needs. 

Any tips would be great.
