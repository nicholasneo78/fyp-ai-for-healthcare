The Time My Friend Betrayed Me
This happened at my high school. I had a fractured finger so I wasn't allowed to do gym. During gym they were playing soccer. My friend knows I really like this guy and she start flirting with him and started hugging him for no reason and I ended up crying because this was so upsetting to me. I confronted her about it and she said she didn't mean so I forgave her. About 4 months ago I got a boyfriend and she started flirting with him and he didn't even care, he flirted back at her. and I went home crying and I decided to break up with the guy and stopped being friends with her for good because I realized that she was flirting with that guy I liked. I am still not friends with her.
