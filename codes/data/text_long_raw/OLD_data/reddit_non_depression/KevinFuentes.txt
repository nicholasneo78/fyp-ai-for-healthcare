Suppose you also have a teenage daughter
My daughter is quite often seen on the phone with her friend since she has her first smartphone. She get used to locking her bedroom when she is out. More often than before she gets home late. I don't know whether she slips out at night when we all sleep.
I'm concerned about her. What I only want is to keep her away from the bad influence. What can I do?
