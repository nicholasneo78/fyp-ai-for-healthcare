What makes someone weird?
I've often been told by people (that like and don't like me alike) that I'm weird. I've become a guarded person because of it but I also embrace that others think of me as...unique. I am generally a confident person. I think I'm nice, genuine, smart and funny and have been told by others that I'm very attractive. What's always bothered me though is not quite knowing why people think I'm weird. I think this information could be useful for first impressions like dates or interviews so I know how to temper this a little. At least initially. The only thing I can think of is that I love horror movies. In general, my interests seem pretty average otherwise (shopping, reading, traveling, etc). So, what makes someone weird?
