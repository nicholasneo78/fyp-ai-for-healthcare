How do I show my family that I love them?
I am 23. I consider myself am emotinally distant person and I like to spend most of my time alone with my dog.

I was watching the road movie and at the end i just started balling my eyes out for 30 mins +. 

In a couple of months I'll  finish my degree and plan to move abroad. I guess the thought of losing my parents and my dog hit me hard. I will still get to see them of course but I think I started crying at the thought of losing them permanently. 

Somehow my dog realized I was sad and came up to cuddle and put his leg on my arm as of to make me feel better (he hates cuddling)

I never told my parents I love them and i don't  think I have it in me to say it I don't  know why. I want to show them. I am think of writing a letter to each of them and saying it in that.

Any ideas? I'm  very distant and and that's why I never been in a long term relashionship
