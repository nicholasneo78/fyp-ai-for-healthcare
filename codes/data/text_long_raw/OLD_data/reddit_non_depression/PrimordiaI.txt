My dad says I'm careless but does nothing himself
Basically my dad came into my room tonight saying that my mom over heard me and my brothers conversation. (we were talking about how hypocritical he is)

He started to get really mad and started yelling at me because I never do anything the right way or enough.

I usually go out to eat so Im like never in the kitchen, when he comes I to my room and starts  screaming at me because I don't help around the kitchen I'm to scared to tell him that neither does he.... For example he had left his hot dog mess, rice mess, and his dishes in the living room all for us to clean up. Generally my mom would pick  up after him and clean up but she is recovering from an injury that was quite serious. So when he comes into my room and yells at me, exaggerating the problem emmensly, for not helping out, I just want to scream in his face that he doesn't do anything and I'm always picking up after him... Continuing to tell me how careless and irresponsible I am. 

I get that I'm not perfect and I do forget some stuff but it just seems like I baby him and I get yelled at if I don't clean up after him.... Someone help me, how can I tell him that he's needs to clean up after himself!
