is it ever okay to stay friends with your best friend's ex?
i'm sort of confused. my best friend's ex invited me to a group outing and i'm not sure if it's right. he also invited my best friend (she said no) and he acts like he has no respect to what happened between them. my best friend though is really upset although they broke up a while ago. what should i do, morally?
