Red-pilling my son
Little background, I have two "sons" (both Eurasians) one is just about to turn 18 and one has just started high school (13) He is into stuff I would consider for lack of a better word "Beta" his interests include puppets and Lego, I've tried to takes these things off him and force him to enjoy some more grown up things but my "wife" keeps giving them back. So I know he's going to struggle with women in high-school because he is super beta and will definitely put them off with his interests and his racial condition. So I'm asking if their are any fathers who have "red-pilled" their children about women and what the best process of introducing red-pill philosophy and sexual strategies to my beta "son" I am thinking he's the right age as now he is beginning to notice girls, I bought him some nudie mags and I know he's been checking them out if you know what I mean, so I definitely think the time is right to give him the red-pill!

Thanks
