Bed time and the tears...
Every night it is the same song and dance.

We have dinner, clean up, bath, games/tv, bed.

I say okay guys, wrap it up and go pee and get a sip of water it is bed time and the moans and groans begin.

It continually gets worse as we go up the stairs and get to the room. I have a 4, 7, and 8 year old and they like to sleep in the same room, it is a bunk bed.

My 7 year old is crying because she says she never gets to make choices and she can’t wait to be grown up and she isn’t tired, etc, etc.....

My youngest becomes kind of rowdy and doesn’t know where she is going to sleep or who she will sleep with.

My oldest is the best, he is actually ready for bed and just laying, waiting for the show to end.

I have a steady bed time each night, around 9:15. 

I am open to suggestions and new ideas. I am at my wits end with the night routine. It actually makes me really sad because no matter how much I do it is never enough for my children. I truly do want them to be happy. I give them several warnings before it is bed time to make sure they are doing what they want before the nights end.
