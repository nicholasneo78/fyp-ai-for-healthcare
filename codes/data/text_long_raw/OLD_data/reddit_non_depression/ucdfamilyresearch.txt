Are you a bisexual, pansexual, or queer parent?
Hi! I am a graduate student in the Sociology Department at the University of California, Davis. I am conducting research on the relationship between sexual orientation and parenting strategies. There is currently a lack of research on bisexual, pansexual, and other non-monosexual identities, particularly as they relate to the family. I would love for you to help me fill this gap of knowledge by participating in my survey. 

Participation in this research includes taking a survey about your sexuality, your family history, and your thoughts on parenting, which will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. You may also volunteer to participate in a follow-up interview, which will take approximately one hour to complete. 

Thank you so much! If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment in this thread.
