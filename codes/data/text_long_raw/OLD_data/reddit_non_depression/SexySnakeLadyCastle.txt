Only friend who consistently wants to hang out with me--I've started liking him less and less! help?
No names or genders here, and I'm not getting into specifics on events just in case...


I have one friend who consistently wants to hang out, unlike my other friends, but the problem is that over the last few years I've started liking them less and less. They're fun to talk to and hang out with -usually- but their personality grates on me and there have been a few times when they have made me quite angry in ways that are difficult to reconcile. They can also end up being a downer though they have been working on it. An unknown quantity of my other friends also dislike them (I know a few for sure, but who knows how many they've pissed off in the meantime) so I either have to plan events without them (and they get upset) or not invite my other friends who dislike them.


We've known each other for years, and they consider myself and a few others very close friends but I have gotten the distinct impression it's one-sided. But they haven't done anything wrong (to ME) that would really merit breaking up a friendship so I've kept begrudgingly hanging out with them and chatting with them even though I'd rather not and just forget they exist. At one point I was one of very, very few friends they had, but I know they have a good consistent friend group now so...


I don't know! Advice, please? Is it ok to just not want to be friends anymore even if the other person hasn't done anything wrong? When I think about hanging out with them even though I know we'd probably do something fun I just feel apprehensive and mildly annoyed.
