New to the US - Looking for friends/adoptive grandparents/parents
I know this is far fetched but it’s worth a shot. I’m a 28 year old female from Canada, living in the United States with my husband. I’m in the immigration process which is great but it also means while I’m waiting I can’t really do much. 

It’s tough when you don’t know many people down here when your far far away from family and friends. 

One can only watch so much Netflix! 

I came upon some very interesting sites for surrogate grandparents which would be amazing, but I feel like I’m too old. I’d love to form a family type bond with some people/a person here who also just needs someone to talk to and occupy their time. 

Anyone have any thoughts/ideas on this? Or maybe you know someone whose also lonely looking for a friend to talk to, any help would be greatly appreciated.
