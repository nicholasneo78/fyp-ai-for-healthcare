Ending a friendship - am I overreacting?
I'm looking for advice from impartial people.

To give a little background information, I recently went through a nasty split with my fiance of several years. My relationship with him, up until the dividing issue, was solid.

I have just discovered that my best friend spent many months telling my coworkers that my relationship was illegitimate, that I was only dating him because I pitied him for his looks, and that my fiance and I were really just platonic friends but that I agreed to get married out of desperation. (To be clear, none of this is true - although others do find him to be unattractive in a conventional sense, I did not. She was projecting.) As a result, as I have now learned, my LEGITIMATE relationship became a workplace joke, and everyone has been mocking me and my fiance behind our backs for a year, including my bosses. This also includes people who I excitedly called after getting engaged and people that I had offered positions in my wedding party to. To make things worse, the fact that the relationship ended is being blamed on me being shallow about his appearance and is being used as vindication for these rumors. Not that it matters, but it ended for a plethora of deeply ingrained and painful issues, none of which were in any way related to appearance.

I feel so betrayed by this friend that I can't imagine ever reconciling. I am preparing to completely cut her from my life and just want to know if others would do the same, or if I'm overreacting to average workplace drama.
