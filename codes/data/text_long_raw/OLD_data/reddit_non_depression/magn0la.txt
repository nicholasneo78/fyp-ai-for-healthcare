Letter from dad. We don't talk about serious stuff and feelings, we write letters.
Usually we don't talk at all (despite living together). So he has a problem with my decisions. He can't talk to me (due to his personality and lack of communication problems and feelings in my fam) so he wrote a letter. 

Are there any other families like this ? :D
