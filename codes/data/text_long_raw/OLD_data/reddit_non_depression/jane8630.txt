How can I tell me friend that I don't want to babysit his (difficult) kid?
I want to be a good friend, and there for him in case of emergencies. I've picked up his kid from daycare before when his babysitter called out on him. But then he asked me to babysit and the hours ended up being 8AM to 7PM(!). He asked me two weeks ago if I could babysit on February 3rd, and I told him I couldn't make a commitment so far in advance. (Knowing he'd have plenty of time to find a sitter). This is clearly not an emergency, and he's about to ask me again (it's a week away). I know I shouldn't have led him on at all; that it's better to be direct. But dear god, I cannot come up with the words to tell him I would rather die than spend any more time alone with his son. Last time I saw his kid, he literally threw a toy car at my face and it hit me in the mouth. He's incredibly defiant and screams bloody murder all day. He refuses to hold my hand if I take him out of the house to the park and screams and screams and I just hate that kidd!!!!!!! 

I know I can't tell him how much I dislike being around his kid, and I don't want to end up hinting at this. Any suggestions on a response text? I don't want to have to keep telling him I have plans. I want him to stop asking.
