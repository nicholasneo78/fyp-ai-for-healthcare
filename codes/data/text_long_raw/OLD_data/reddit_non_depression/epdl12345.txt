Should my friend pay for the damage she caused to my car?
I asked my friend to drive my car and pick me and some of our other friends up from a party. She drove about 7 miles, 15 mins, with the parking brakes on. I took it to the shop the next day and they said I would be fine for now, but I would need to repair the damage within a month. They said it would be $250. 
If it was me I would've offered to pay 100% right away.
Should I ask her to pay? Should I get her insurance involved?
We're both college students and she doesn't have a job. I don't want to ruin the friendship, but I'm already super upset about the damage to my car and feel that she should take responsibility for this.
What should I do??
