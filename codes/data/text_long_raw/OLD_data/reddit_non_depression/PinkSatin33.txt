Whats her problem?
I told a friend i became vegan and she talked about it behind my back with other friends that i didnt tell yet.She told me after that one of the girls said that i wouldnt last as a vegan and was kind of bringing me down about it.Shes not even vegetarian or vegan and guess what ..this friend immediately started eating vegetarian meals and watching vegan videos and now she says shes vegetarian and wants to go vegan.I'm so annoyedd she talked shit about me not being able to be vegan and all and now thats what she wants to do and became a vegetarian.
