Best friend is dating someone who is not right for them
Hi! So my best (guy) friend is dating this girl who really doesn't treat him well and we have talked about it and he himself has said he's not very happy with her but then goes right back to her? He's been in this cycle with her for a long time and it's getting concerning. I just don't want to see him sad or hurt :/ what should I do?
