Drifting away from my best friend
My best friend and I have known each other for well over a decade, and have gone to the same schools and last year when she went away. 

We text everyday and see each other regularly but recently I’ve been feeling so disjointed from her.

We’re really close and I’ve told her things I’ve never told anyone. 

She just got into her first serious relationship, had sex for the first time, got drunk for the first time and also had her first pregnancy scare (i was with her when she took the test).  We’re 17 by the way.

However, whenever we talk it’s always about her life, and her boyfriend. She built up so much courage to dump him only to get back with him the next week. They’ve known each other for only a month and he said i love you within a week of them dating. He’s emotionally manipulative and so immature but she insists that she only tells me the bad things about him not the good things. 

I want to support her but she makes it so hard. She never asks about my life anymore. I’m going through a really tough time yet it’s never come up. All we talk about is her and her relationship. I know it’s a big part of her life but it feels like my life is just irrelevant to her.

I’ve never drank alcohol or had sex or even been in a relationship so it feels like we’re just drifting apart. I don’t relate to her anymore. 

Obviously I love her loads but it feels like this friendship is one sided and purely based on her. 

I don’t know whether to keep putting effort into this friendship or not?
