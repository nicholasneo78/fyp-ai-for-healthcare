How can I cut ties with my cousin?
I’ve been wanting to stop all contact with my cousin. He’s toxic to me and my family relationship. He’s very controlling and manipulative. There’s a couple of problems though. He’s dating my girlfriends sister and we currently have the same job. I want to stop all form of contact with him. But i feel its impossible given the circumstances that we’re in.
