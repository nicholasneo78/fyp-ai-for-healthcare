Family troubles
So me and my husbands parents and sister had a falling out two years ago about 3 months ago was the first time we saw each other at a Xmas gathering and while the falling out was happening my husbands sister fell pregnant with their first child and she is due in two months but they aren’t referring to me as Aunty but the will say uncle to my husband and I’m finding this a bit hurtful as technically I am the child’s Aunty and did nothing wrong to his family oh and I refer to his sister as Aunty to my kids and they are my kids god mother before the falling out happened. What should I do?
