Friend threatened to ruin my therapists life over a joke.
OK so I had a bit of a blur of boundaries with my therapist. It wasn't a big deal. Therapy ended and we became kind of distant friends who still chat via phone calls and texting.

However I told my friend that my therapist fancied me etc whilst things were happening. I told her to promise to keep it a secret even if I died. Nothing happened between me and my therapist and we never slept together, but things were a bit... Weird i guess. Some of the stuff my therapist said could make her lose her job.

Anyway I pranked my friend today by photoshopping a fake conversation between me and my college tutor. In the convo I told them my friend referred to him as "daddy nick" behind his back. It was merely a joke and I didn't really message the tutor any of this.

She freaked out when I sent her the photoshopped convo. And her immediate response was: "I'm going to ruin your therapists life for this!" I told her it was a joke and a prank. She demanded evidence which i gave her... She then acted as though things were fine when they weren't.

She said if I ever do anything like that again she'll ruin my therapists life. I feel as though she is basically at this point a bomb waiting to go off. She then asked me how my rabbit is doing??? Like I want to speak to her now???


Am I doing the right thing for wanting to ignore her and even removing her from my life?
