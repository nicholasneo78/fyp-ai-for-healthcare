My parents hate each other.
My parents have argued pretty much my entire life, for at least 30 years. Every time I visit or see them interacting with each other involves loud, aggressive name-calling and tears. I have tried everything...suggesting therapy...even divorce, yet they seem to always stay together. My siblings do not come around as often due to this. What can I do to just let go of this? Is that even possible?
