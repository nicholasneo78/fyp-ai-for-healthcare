My bestie guilt trips me constantly
My best friend moved to the other side of Canada. Anyone who knows anything about North American geography knows that Canada is effing huge and so it's expensive to travel that far west. 

I've planned a really awesome solo backpacking trip to Southeast Asia. Five countries in 13 weeks. Anyway, when she found out, she was pissed I'm not spending that money on going out to see her instead. And she said something like "if I had any extra cash I'd be using it to come see you"... Which makes me feel like absolute crap. She clearly doesn't understand wanderlust... I wanna see other cultures and it's just not the same to travel within your own country. Anyway, after she said that I snapped and said I'm done with her guilt trips. This is just one example of her pulling this kind of thing. 

Did I do the right thing?
