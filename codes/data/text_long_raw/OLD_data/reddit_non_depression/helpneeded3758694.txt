How can I make friends?
I used to be very sociable and have lots of friends but I have always only had a few very close friends. I was in a relationship for 7 years and he wore me down so much I stopped going out and speaking to my friends. My few close friends have always been around. Years later and now two more relationships down I find myself with nobody. I have just split up with my boyfriend and he made me sociable but they were his friends. Out of my 3 closest friends, one has moved away, the other has a husband and children and works so doesn't have much free time and the other seems to be ignoring but I don't know why. I literally have no friends, I have no real hobbies or things to do so how am I supposed to meet new friends?
