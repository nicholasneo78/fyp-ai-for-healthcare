Feeling sad for my daughter/realizing grandparents won't live forever
My husband and I had a child later in life. She's 18 months old and her grandparents on both sides are in their mid-late 60's. My parents are very healthy and I don't think of them as "old", so I mentioned that my daughter could live close to them if she chose to go to University in the city where they live. My mom chimed up and said that they may both be dead by then (for context, they're Chinese and it's completely normal for them to be this blunt with their children). 

I've had other family members pass away before, but it just hit me that no matter how you prepare yourself for that day, you'll never be ready to say goodbye. It's never enough time.

I immediately felt very sad for my young daughter and just hope that we have lots of time left to bond and make memories. We live 5 hours away by car, so it's hard to see them as regularly as we'd like, but we try to visit and have them visit as often as we can. I just hope she gets to spend as much time as possible with them.
