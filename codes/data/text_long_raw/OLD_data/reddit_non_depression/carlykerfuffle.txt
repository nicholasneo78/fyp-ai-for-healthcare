Is my dad enabling my mom?
I have posted on multiple subs about my turbulent relationship with my mom, and I feel like I am afraid of her. I've gotten to a point where I jump when the garage door opens and she comes home from work. I think have become so irrationally afraid of my mom, that fear manifested today when I was going to pick my brother up from work and saw my mom coming the other way. I freaked out and ended up rear-ending another car, totaling mine (I am not hurt, don't worry.) Needless to say, this whole situation has caused chaos in my house and I am terrified to ever get behind the wheel again.

Tonight my dad called me out on me calling my mom "abusive" a few weeks ago. Bear in mind, neither she nor my dad has ever laid a finger on me, but my mom has emotionally abusive tendencies. She has said things to me that have fucked me up more than she can understand.

Here's a short list of some things she's done:

* If guilt tripping were an Olympic sport, let's just say she'd be Michael Phelps.
* She likes to ask me what's wrong when I'm upset and when I tell her, she cuts me off and says "I don't want to talk about it."
* She has criticized my weight for as long as I can remember. In her defense, her two sisters are 500 pounds apiece will both probably die before they reach 60, so she just wants me to be healthy and live long. But she's not helping. She's only making me want to cry into a Chipotle bowl.
* She liked comparing me to my best friend in high school ("Why can't you be more like her? She studies and gets good grades!") Still does sometimes.
* To this day, she pesters me about my lack of religion. I remember when I was 11 and didn't want to go to Sunday School, she was like "Do you want to be a heathen and go to hell?" A couple years ago, she told me "I just want you to go to Heaven when you die." She even pestered me a week ago about having demons in my head.
* I thought I could confide in her about my sexuality but she quickly shot me down with "How do you know? You've never been on a date before. That doesn't mean you're bi/gay!" She also told me I am asexual and she's pretty much gaslighted me about my sexuality to the point where I don't know whether I am gay or straight anymore.
* I was diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD when I was a kid and she's basically used that diagnosis to keep me in a little bubble. I didn't get drivers' license until 18, didn't get my first job until 20, and I'm still perpetually single... all because my mom has used my diagnoses as a crutch. She still does, and after the accident, I don't fucking blame her!

Whenever I try to tell him about the things my mom says, he says things like "What's wrong with motivating you to get better grades?" or "Your mom doesn't want you to end up like your sisters that she is going to bury because they're 500 pounds." My mom is my bully, and he is her apologist.

I don't how much of this (if anything) constitutes abuse, but my dad doesn't buy any of it and blames it on "liberal millennial indoctrinated safe-space snowflake bullshit... abuse is broken bones, black eyes and cigarette burns on arms." He goes on about how he and mom have done everything for me and how there is something in my sick, twisted mind that is confusing "constructive criticism" with "abuse."

Deep down, I am beginning to resent my parents, because they *have* done everything for me, sheltered me and spoiled me to the point where I don't know how the world outside my little bubble works. I am 23 now and don't feel any better off now than I did when I was ten years ago. There are certain life skills I don't have because they did everything for me. I don't feel like I've ever had to work for anything and I hate them for it. They tried to be tougher with me but didn't have the spine. They never forced me to do anything except go to summer camps for special needs kids, they pretty much just let me raise myself and it's costing all of us dearly. Tonight is the night my real life begins.

Basically, if I am so afraid of my mom that seeing her on the road freaks me out to the point of an accident, something in our relationship has gone south. I don't know if it's her or me anymore.
