Best friend of 7 years dropped me like nothing.
So I'm in an LDR, and my boyfriend came to visit where I live for the first time. It was our second meeting so we were so happy to be together. So I took him to meet my best friend who had supported me in my relationship because she had a similar situation going on. After my visit with him at her house, I asked if we could go over again the next night and she told me no because I third wheeled her in her own house. However, I don't feel we did that because we weren't affectionate around her and her parents were in the room as well. A little after he left I apologize to her even though I didn't feel I had done anything wrong. Recently, she has deleted me off most social media platforms and if Imma be honest... I don't care. 

Yes. I miss having the girl companion, having another girl to talk to about things. But, I don't want a friend that isn't a true friend. Who just dumps 7 years of friendship over feeling like a 3rd wheel. I think there was a jealousy element to it but I'll never know. Because I'm not chasing her, she's gotta come to me. I'm don't chasing her
