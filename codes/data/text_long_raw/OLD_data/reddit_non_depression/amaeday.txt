overbearing male friend
So my [f/18] male friend has recently has become increasingly overbearing, acting as if he deserves to know every minute detail about my life and what I'm doing. I feel as if I'm constantly oversharing and it makes me uncomfortable, but if i refuse to answer  he starts saying things like "is everything okay between us" "I'm sorry for whatever i've done". Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this situation?
