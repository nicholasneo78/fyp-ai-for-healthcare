My parents divorced when I was a kid, and I remained estranged from my father for a long time. On Father’s Day of 2017, I picked up the phone and called him. “Absent Sire” is the result of those conversations.

This is the introductory episode to my podcast series, “Absent Sire”. It’s a 10-part audio diary of conversations with my estranged father. I knew who my dad was growing up, and he was mostly out of the picture. In this introductory episode you’ll learn about who I am, the struggles I’ve faced, and why I chose to do this. If’s there’s interest I’ll keep posting new episodes as I create them as well as updates (I'll most likely switch media hosts in the future). 

Please leave feedback, and share with anyone and everyone who you’d think benefit from hearing it. I was inspired by podcasts such as Death Sex and Money, Dear Sugars, and mainly, This Is Actually Happening. Thanks for listening.
