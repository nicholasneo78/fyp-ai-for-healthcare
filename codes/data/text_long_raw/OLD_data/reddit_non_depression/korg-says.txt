I have never met or know what my real father looked like. That changed this week. Also I found out I have two more sisters.
So, my wife's family is really into ancestry and tracing lineage all the way back they can. Because of this, my wife really wanted to do 23andme and, being the good husband I try to be, I got her kits as a gift. Fast forward to Monday, the day I got my reports back. I'm scrolling through, ooo'ing and aww'ing at the things I didn't know, and then I go to their DNA relative section. Now, my wife had a few 3rd or 4th cousins who did the kit as well. Not me. I had one half sister listed. I was immediately stunned, because I only knew my real father's name and this girl had his last name. After sending a few messages, we find out that, yes in fact, she is my other half-sister (I have a half-brother and two other half-sisters)! Not only that, but I have two other half-sisters! 

My whole world was turned upside down this week. Prior to this, I had no interest in finding or knowing my real father. But, after seeing his picture for the first time and seeing how my sisters revere him. I am considering it. ON TOP OF THAT, this whole turn of events is like a Lifetime movie plot. Sadly he was in a car accident last week and was in critical condition. Even if I wanted to reach out, I don't think now is a good time. 

So, for now, I'm getting to know my new-found sisters and I'm very excited. We all want to meet up at some point!
