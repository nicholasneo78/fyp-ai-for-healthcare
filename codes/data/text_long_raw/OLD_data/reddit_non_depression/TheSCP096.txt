Will my best friend come back because of this reason?
In about April my best friend cut me off from her life, we were friends for nearly 7 months and we were so close, had a really strong bond, and the only time we wouldn't talk to eachother whether it'd be facetime, messenger or call as well as trying to see eachother as often as possible, was when we would sleep. Otherwise, we were always talking to eachother and we cared for and loved eachother a great deal and did heaps for eachother but yeh she did in fact cut me off because I didn't reply to her messages one day. Anyway we haven't communicated at all since then but I sent her a letter for this year 12 camp we did so it's a graduation letter dedicated to her. I told her I would send it to her when we were friends and I'm not sure if she's forgotten but it is going to be sent to her. The contents of it go along the lines of thanking her, stating how much I appreciate her and that I'll always be there for her no matter the situation in 1 1/2 pages. I'm not 100% but could this possibly bring me and her back to being friends again?
