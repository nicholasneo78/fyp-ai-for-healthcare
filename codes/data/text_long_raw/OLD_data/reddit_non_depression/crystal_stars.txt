Need advice on helping a friend escape an abusive dad
A week ago, my best friend Jake (not his real name) confided in me that he has been physically and emotionally abused by his father since childhood. We are both 17 years old and we have been best friends for 4 years. I was really shocked when I found out because everyone in our high school friend circle sees him as extremely seemingly cheerful and upbeat. I'm his best friend, and I never suspected anything was wrong. 
This morning, he texted me saying that he was running away from home. He told me he left his home with a backpack full of clothes and $100 that he had secretly saved up without his dad's knowledge. I'm very worried about him. On the one hand, I think he should get out of that dangerous situation as soon as possible. On the other hand, I think it will be very difficult for him to survive on his own with so little money. Any advice on how I could help him as a friend?
