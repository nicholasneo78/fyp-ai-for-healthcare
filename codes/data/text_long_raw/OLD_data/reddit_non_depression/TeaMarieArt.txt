Trying to repair a lost friendship
First time poster here so sorry if I don’t explain things very well

So a few months ago I went on a trip with my friend and both of our boyfriends. I got a little controlling with the planning of the trip and that caused some tension. And after they went to a party they didn’t want us accompanying them to I got upset and distanced myself a little. This lead to her boyfriend and I having an argument. Where he stated if I weren’t a girl he’d ‘bash me’. 

After this we haven’t spoken but the friend recently contacted my mother to check in on how she was with some local flooding. 
This has made me think that she still cares for me, and I still greatly care for her.

I’m having trouble approaching how to contact her. And while I know that it was said in anger I feel like I deserve an apology from her boyfriend, or at least reassurance that he won’t ever actually attack me. 

Is it unreasonable to want an apology from him? Should I let it go? 

I feel I should also note I do have sever anxiety, that’s why I struggle with situations like these so much.
