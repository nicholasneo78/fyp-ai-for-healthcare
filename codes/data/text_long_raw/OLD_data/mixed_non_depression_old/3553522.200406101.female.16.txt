 SUMMER SUCKS!  I know, I know...*my* opinion. My computer's not working right, so I can't use my MSN messenger and Yahoo barely works. Therefore, I haven't been able to talk to the majority of my friends this summer. Phones are always busy or they're not home. Or, like my best friend, Jimmy, too busy with his girlfriend to talk to me... Not to mention that I've been working alot lately. I got my permit last Friday, so I've been driving alot lately, lol, which is fun, damn near gave my mom a heart attack on several occasions. LOL. Well, I'll post again later.
