How can I help my husband?
My husband is an enlisted member of the Army. I know it’s common to hear that someone works so hard, but my husband truly works so hard. He is up at 2:30 every morning and comes home around 5:00. Just this morning, they had an 8-mike ruck March. His leadership isn’t the best and kind of leave a lot to my husband because he’s the type that just gets stuff done. His supervisor leaves at random times of the day. Yesterday he left work at around 2pm saying it was his mother-in-law’s birthday and had to take her out for dinner. I say all this to ask what are some things I can do to help my husband? To alleviate the workload?
