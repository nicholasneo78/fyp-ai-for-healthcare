 Picture my life.      I picture my life, the epitome of happiness.    A dream, a house, a car.   A yard, Two kids, a puppy.    A happy life with my husband.    A distance to travel to see family.       But instead, Picture my life.    A nightmare, anger, sorrow, frustration   A yard at my parents house,    One children cries, another wishing for love.   A disappointment after another with a commitment phobic.   Parents downstair, yelling and screaming.      Picture my life.
