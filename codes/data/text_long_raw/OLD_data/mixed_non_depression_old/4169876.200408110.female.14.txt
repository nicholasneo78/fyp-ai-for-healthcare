Lee,what a lame teacher....but actually she quite good lah....I got scolding from her because i didn't do her work,of course lah kena scolding:P. I'm in school with my friend,Praveena as she is my project group member for maths.Luckily she is willing to do project with me, if i ask the others...don't you wish they will follow...
