 I had a pretty solid day today. First I took my spanish exam, bombed it. I mean let's be serious spanish? I don't even speak it how the hell am I supposed to pass a test on it? But then I came home early cause' I had a free period the next exam so I came home and took a power nap on the couch. Next thing I know my sister is waking me up telling me I can have her phone because she's going to get a new one. Well I don't know if you all know the difference between my sister's phone and mine, but it's a big phone. So now I have a new phone and I also bought a few dvds a couple days ago. I got The Simpsons Season 4 (best one) and Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 2. For those of you who aren't familiar with Curb Your Enthusiasm it's the only show that rivals the comedy of Chapelle's Show. I also purchased, "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" it's a good one. But for now I just finished mowing the lawn and I should do Cole diddy's final "preperation" for my final tomorrow. Smoke rocks.
