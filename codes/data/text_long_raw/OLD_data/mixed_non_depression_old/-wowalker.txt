My male cousin stopped talking to me all of sudden.
Let's call my cousin Bobby.

My mother is the oldest daugther and my aunt (her sister, and Bobby's mother) is the youngest, with an age gap of 15 years old and even though they weren't really close (my mom moved to another province when she turned 18 and didn't came back to where we live now until she was 43, 2 years after my birth), we used to see each other at least 2 times in a week.
I'm an only child while he is the youngest of 2 sons and since he's only 3 years older than me, my mom and my aunt thought it'd be nice to make us spend time together. We got close, really close and were like inseparable. But when he turned 12 or 13, he did stop talking to me, all of sudden. He doesn't say hi to me when he and his family visit us. Hell, he doesn't even look at me when I open the door. A year ago, during New Year's Eve, we were sitting in front of each other during dinner and I was staring at him because he looks really good now that he lost the acne. He noticed what I was doing so I moved my gaze to one of my cousin's baby and when I looked back at him, he avoided my gaze.

I told my friends about him and they say that he must be embarrassed about something but I dunno about what or why since he never did something weird or bad to me. 

All of my other relatives told me he would start talking to me again when he got older and mature. But oh surprise: he is now 20 and at college, and he still doesn't talk to me and avoid my gaze.
