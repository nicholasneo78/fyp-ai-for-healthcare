 I think I first heard about "blogs" about a year ago. I'm sure at the time I swore I'd never have one, now here I am. A suggestion from a good friend and I steped right up...me and myself might have something to say about what "I" have done.   A year ago things were simpler. I had no idea what I was in store for. Getting laid-off, going back to school, losing people I never thought I'd see walk away. On the other hand I guess I didn't think I'd get to see my parents again for the first time in 5 years. I probably have more mixed feelings about that than anything...but I'll save that for another post...  So here I am. Somehow the world feels smaller every year. I feel like the boundaries society places on our minds through work and school has shrunk my mind and locked it up...I didn't feel this way a year ago...as if every year this world pushes us all one step closer to accepting the bull shit as normal...  I'm not normal...now I'm a blogger
