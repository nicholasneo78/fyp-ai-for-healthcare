 I love to see the ocean's beauty   And the moon that shines above   Alone in the sand looking at the stars   Wishing someday I would find true love   Would it be nice to see the morning   With the one you love the most   Would it be nice to say goodnight   To the one you hold so close to your heart......to your heart    The wind that blows the dove   is the wind that blows my love   Hope it'll find its way to you wherever you are    I love to sit in fields of green   Looking deeply through the sky   Watching birds as they fly by   Hoping someday fate will bring me true love   Would it be nice to hold someone   So dear, near your heart   Would it be nice to hear those words   I love you from the one that you love...... that you love    The wind that blows the dove   is the wind that blows my love   Hope it'll find its way to you wherever you are    I'd love to see myself one day   In the arms of someone   Who will share her life with me   Selflessly   Someday   You will find your way to me    The wind that blows the dove   is the wind that blows my love   Hope it'll find its way to you wherever you are
