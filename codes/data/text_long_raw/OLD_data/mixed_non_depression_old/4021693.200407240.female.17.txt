 urlLink    This is at "A Week On Broadway" camp at KSU. That's everyone, it was pretty awesome. What am I doing with a few other people?? Holding up a diamond. Our groups formation was in the shape of a diamond on the day that we danced. Well, anywho. That class was SO awesome, mainly cause of the people.  urlLink
