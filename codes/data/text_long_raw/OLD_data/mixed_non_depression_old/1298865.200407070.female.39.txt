 Well, all in all things are going well. Day two went well yesterday and I tried to report it to my journal on www.BFL101.com but it is down. Since Monday a.m. I've dropped 4 1/2 lbs of water weight (who's kidding who here - I KNOW it is water) but weight is weight and it feels good. I've eaten clean for two whole days (except for a nip of Brandy last night) and it feels terrific.  Yesterday I rode my bike indoors on the windtrainer for a whole 20 minutes! I can't wear my regular brace when I do that because it only gives my 90deg of movement, and I need about 115 to ride. So I wore the tensor, which seemed to be enough. And I iced it down after.  Today is a weights day. I will get going after I drop the kids off.  Kyle had a friend over yesterday and they spent hours on the computer going to funny links. A couple are great star trek TNG clips. I'll have to try to find them.  LCS
