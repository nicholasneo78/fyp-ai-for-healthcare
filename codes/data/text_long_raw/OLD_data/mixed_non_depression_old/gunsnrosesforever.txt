Is it normal that my parents won't let me travel alone?
Hello, everyone!! I live in Portugal and my favorite band isn't playing in my country so I decided I wanted to see them in Madrid or Paris... I'm still deciding which country to pick. Is it normal that my parents won't let me travel alone? I'm 20 years old and they are paying for my college bills, but I would totally pay this trip. They are saying that it is very dangerous for a girl to go alone and that I don't understand because I don't have kids. Do you think this is a normal behavior by my parents? They scream at me and say that don't let me go like they own me... :/
