 Hopefully I don't become obsessed about entering info daily here...truth be told, there is nothing on TV. Saw an interesting personal license plate "No Klu"...someone obviously not familiar with american culture. Well thats kind of on par with some restaurants in my neighborhood "The Edibles" and "Veg Table" (more wacky bad english interpretations to come). Ok, now I'm on a roll! Lets get into some little things that piss me off. In L.A. someone decided to memorialize freeways to dead cops and people of inerest. Now, I'm not insensitive to a cop being killed on the job, but do we really have to name a freeway after them? They chose there job, and knew the risk...I'm sorry. I'm sure I will not be allowed to get my street re-named after my dead cat! And the "Rosa Parks Freeway"? Did I miss her bus ride on the 10 freeway when I was growing up? Now what WOULD be cool...commercial freeways. Taking the Tide freeway east to the Viagra interchange north to connect to the Budweiser freeway east...ahh, home at last.
