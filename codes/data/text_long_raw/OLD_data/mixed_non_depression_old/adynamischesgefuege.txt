My little brother was in pain and I didn't help him
I need to get something off my chest that I haven't talked to anyone about before. It's about a situation, where my mother freaked out over my little brother's bratty behaviour. He was about 5 years old and throwing a fit, he was in a really bad moment, he kicked my leg, and all those things weren't pretty. Something must have been bothering him, usually he is a very wonderful person, funny and smart, but just threw a tantrum like every kid does once in a while. When he called me a bitch (his big sister, and I might even have been teasing him) my mother totally freaked out, she scolded him loudly and he already started crying. She went outside to the car and took out his car seat and said she wouldn't need it anymore now that he's not part of the family anymore but will be taken away by child services.

He stood on the front porch and cried his heart out and screamed to my mother "I don't want to go to the welfare home" (that's what it was called to him apparently) and he sobbed so desperately and feared for his life and safety. And my mom then looked at him sternly and asked him to apologize and then they hugged and made up.

It is probably the most painful thing in my life. I know he might already have forgotten it and he gets along quite well with my mother (he's a teenager now), but I do think back to that moment and feel that stabbing pain in my chest, as I was standing there passively and watching my mother use him emotionally. He was so fragile and vulnerable, and if I could, I would just wrap him in my arms and love and comfort him, until there's no sadness left in him.
