 if you ask me i have an ok life but i have had lots of problems in the past. i wish i could go back and change some of them. but that won't work. sometimes i wish that i could have things the way i want it, but it just doesn't work that way. i know some people might feel the same way. but i have  had love, drama, parent, and other things that i could of changed. i know they happen for a reason but i wish they didn't. well i hope everyone else's life is Better than mine. and i wish for myself that my life will be better on the way, as i live it.    ~littlebear200~
