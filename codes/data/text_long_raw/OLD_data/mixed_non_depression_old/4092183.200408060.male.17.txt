 Ya,we won a friendly match today it was against bedok police basketball team. It was a great match, whenever we score they will also return it. And the score was always so close not more than 6 i think, both team are having a hard time trying to score but because they were taller and bigger in size so we reaili had a hard time fighting for the rebound. Sad because of today's match i was injury again got elbow by 1 of them but he did't do it purposely so i did't mind it. Anyway i like this kind of match most, it was so fun to have evenly match opponent. (",)
