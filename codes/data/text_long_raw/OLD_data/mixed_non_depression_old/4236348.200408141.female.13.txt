 Ah, today was pretty good. I guess this is my new blog. I like it. I'll type random stuff: what i'm doing, what I did, and jokes, and all because this is my personal space! Ok...heres what happened. Today I wake up come down stairs and the guy I have a crush on is sleeping on my floor...he was drunk! It was funny. So after he leaves he stops my like 6 more times.  THANK YOU GOD!!!!!! Well I'm glad for that. But my friend is trying to "get with him" if you catch my drift. Thats a bad thing. DUH! So, she asked his little brother out he said no...and told me YEA! Then after that she asked his other brother he said no...and now she wants HIM! But thats not gonna happen cause i'm gonna make my move. Because Every Hottie with A Body Needs A Cutie With A bootay! Thats my stuff. If you don't like it tuff bacuse thats MY DAY! So Plus i'm on a diet!
