I'm new to reddit so forgive me for not knowing how things are usually done.

OR here it is:
(just trying to get people to read this, I'm trying to communicate.)

So my sister (30's) cheated on her husband of 6 years with my best friend (early 20's). I'm not sure if ages matter but for some reason that stuck out for me. She now is getting divorced from her husband and he knows that I know. It's fucking strange. I literally just walked into my house with my best friend and my sister was attempting to use my printer to help her print out documents related to her DIVORCE. Basically because of my friend.

Hard to deal with this, anyone have any ideas besides drinking my life away?
