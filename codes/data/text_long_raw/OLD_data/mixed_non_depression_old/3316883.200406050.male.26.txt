 I was recently watching one of my favourite movies, the wizard of Oz and i realized that you can only move on if you learn that dreams don't necesseraly come true, that pain don't necesseraly pass by and that you have to lock your dreams and your hopes somewhere deep in your soul. It is hard to find out that you will not be necesseray happy, you will not find someone who loves you the way you love him. But it doesn't matter, you learn to come along, you learn to get tougher and tougher. I'm afraid, afraid of waking me up one day and find out that i'm feeling anything. I prefer to suffer, because it means I'm alive...
