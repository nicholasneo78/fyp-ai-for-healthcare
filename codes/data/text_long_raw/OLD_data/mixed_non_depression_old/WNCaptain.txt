Welcome to /r/FriendshipAdvice!
Hi guys and gals, 

Welcome to /r/FriendshipAdvice! This subreddit was born as a result of [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/23bhtz/how_did_you_lose_your_best_friend/) AskReddit thread. Losing a friend is one of the worst feelings ever, so my goal with this subreddit is to allow reddit users to help other reddit users with their friendship issues. 

Since this subreddit is brand new, feel free to offer any suggestions that you may have.
