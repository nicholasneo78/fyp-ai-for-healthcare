 This weekend went by fast, even though it was lacking in things to do. Despite the budsmoke it was a kinda sucky weekend. I dunno...I haven't been going out with Sarah long and I don't know her very well, but I feel like its always gonna stay that way. We never seem to spend more than a half an hour--tops together and theres never any conversation. I wish we could talk or see each other but maybe shes just too busy...Guess I'll just have to wait for that one day when I call shes home or she calls me to see her...that one day...somewhere down the road. I came home early tonight to do some make-up work and Im glad to say I at least got some done so hopefully I can pass grammer, I don't know about ICA though those essays seem to be amongst the missing. Well going back to my bed and the one thing I can always count on to be comforting...sleep.
