 It's amazing what some people will do for fun and excitement. Although, in telling about this I incriminate myself. But anyway.  So we all (a group of people...I guess as opposed to dogs, cats, aliens, or rubber duckies) decided we wanted to take a walk along the canal. However, the weather decided it was going to rain at the same time. Now, rain would usually stop a sane person from taking a walk outside, but no...no one ever said we were sane. So we walked...in the rain and lightning and thunder...with umbrellas held high...all in the name of fun (and, oh yeah...exercise).  My official battle cry was, "It's just water."  Hmm...it's a shame we don't go out and play in the rain more.
