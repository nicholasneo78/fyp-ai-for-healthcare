 Hey everybody!   I'm off!     yup, going away for a week and a weekend, so I shall see you all later!     I'm going to my grandparents house on tomorrow for a night, then driving to Naramata, a small town in the Oakanagan, by Penticton.     There is Naramata Centre, the best place on earth, relaxing, and fun, and just plain AWESOME! I will see you all at the end!     Goodbye!
