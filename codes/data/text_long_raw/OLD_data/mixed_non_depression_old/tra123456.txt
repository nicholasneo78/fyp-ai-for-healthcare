Gossiping in the family
Hello. I am not sure whether this fits in this sub but I am going to ask it anyway. My family is a known gossiper. All of them tend to gossip about me. I am the odd ball, the one who doesn't agree with them. The one they all tend to chat about. Many times we have arguments, they all gain up on me. I will have my mom, dad, and older sisters all attacking my character- telling me I am no good and that I am poison . I have caught them in a few instances; but they brush it off. Often, they pretend I am being paranoid or they play dumb and be like, "I did nothing, we said nothing." Sometimes they complain about someone else to use it to get to me. It's really bothersome. It makes me feel so betrayed, confused, and really angered. I also not my family learns things about me before I even told them- mainly negative. There are lists of inconsistent gaps. I try to confront them but they immediately dismiss me. They try to cover up their tracks and always tell me I am paranoid. I know lots of the advice will be to confront them, but I do not believe that will work. I have tried that- all kinds of approaches but they insist they did nothing even when I catch them saying things about me. My mother does it the most. Often she, gossips after work with my sisters or sometimes with my dad. Sometimes my sisters gossip about me together. I have become the play thing in the family- my problems and life is just a giant joke they can share their contempt for. It's hurts. It's hard not to give a shot because it's your own family. I have considered audio recording secretly but that is creepy and invades their privacy despite they do that with me often. It's also wrong to play the same game. What should I do? I really am at a loss.
