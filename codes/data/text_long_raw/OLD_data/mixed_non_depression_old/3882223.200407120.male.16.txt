 Christ. This weekend kinda epitomised what my summer will be like. I don't think B wants to know me any longer, after no pickups and four calls... I don't think I'm on the top of peoples lists right now. When the others get on their school break, they're off to Poland which shall leave me here, back to square one. But, so I hope, when they return a real summer shall commence. [I can only keep my fingers crossed so much]. V gets back from work this evening, but I doubt I'll be seeing him if he gets back in the early hours. I guess next week will be spent in a coffee shop, drinking soft drinks and a cigarette in one hand - as per...  I don't know why I have such  great expectations of the Summer. I think it all stems from the Green days - when I was Mr. Popular. Well, so it seemed. Then that faded out and I was left with another lot of people...now im just hoping that doesn't fade out. I don't think it will.  But, there is a new prospect ahead of me, a'course. New school, new people, new faces, new opportunites blah x 3. Things are going to be new, and, perhaps my past will fade out, but there's something ahead afterwards. How mnelodramatic. Today, I shall do nothing. Its 2:25 pm and im in my duvet undressed at the pc. Dad's currently at the Tour de France in a smaller championship - we all pray he doesn't fall off a mountain. lol.   ...I had the sudden urge yesterday to watch willow. I must buy it.  P
