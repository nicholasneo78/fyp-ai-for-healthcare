 So, I just found out my grandmother died last night. Apparently people paged my at 2 am but I didn't hear it, so I just found out. So, why don't I feel anything? Is it because it was expected? I think she is in a better place now. She is no longer suffering, which makes me happy. And now I have to go to a wedding today. Not really what I feel like doing, but oh well. At least I will be with friends, and they will understand. And they will make sure I get nice and pissed tonight, which I think I need.
