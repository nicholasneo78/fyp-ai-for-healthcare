I miss my best friend and they miss me
I'm 12 and my best friend is 11. We both have the same birthday and were best friends last year. So this year I chose to homeschool for something. And during this year I've barely seen my best friend. I would ask my mom a lot to setup some weekly hang-out with him but it never got to happen.During this time we've found a soccer team to play on together. One practice, we got to talk after. During this chat he mentioned him always asking his mom to let me come to his house. I stated I did the same thing. That night it made me glad he wanted to hang out with me all the time. About 5 days later I realized what this chat meant. Really when he stated that he asked his mom about me coming over a lot, he was practically saying he missed me. And when I stated the same thing back I was saying the same thing. I learned it was a test of friendship from him, and that we were both thinking the same thing, missing eachother a lot. Right now, we're both just waiting for a weekly hang-out to happen. During this wait, we're both sad; what's the best thing for me to do when we're waiting? Should I try and talk to him more? (he doesn't have any way of texting me at the time)
