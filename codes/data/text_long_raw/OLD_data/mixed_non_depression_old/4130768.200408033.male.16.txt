 Well, today was another eventful day of school...if that's what you want to call it. Today was a "B" day, so I had Adv. English; Band; Alg. II; and Adv. Biology. I really don't like these days. I mean, the only class I really like is english because Ms. Curtis is pretty cool. I don't even like band at the moment. I'll tell you more about it later. But yeah, I really hate days like this.
