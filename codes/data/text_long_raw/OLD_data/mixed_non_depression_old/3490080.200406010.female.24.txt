Finally, last night went there with my best friend. at first, i thought i will be deadly late then i sms her and told her that i might be late. who knows she just took the train right before me! so after she alight a while, i be there with her! feel like luckly...  then we planned to dine at foodcourt... walk walk walk... foodcourt seems disappear... so we asked the security guard.
