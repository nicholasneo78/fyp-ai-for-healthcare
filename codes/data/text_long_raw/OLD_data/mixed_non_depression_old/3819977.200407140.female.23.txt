 The city I work in, which feels and seems much more like a town, has a courthouse square downtown.  There is a big courthouse surrounded by a fair bit of grassy area with lots of trees, a beautiful little spot really.  It really adds to the whole town feeling.  All sorts of things happen in the town square: art festivals, performing art festivals, food & drink tasting, local merchant festival, and many more.    Well, one thing I've noticed since I started working downtown is that people (men mainly) like to take a mid-day nap in this courthouse square.  I lived outside of new Orleans before I moved here, so at first I thought these nappers were homeless people, untill I paid a little more attention to them.  The majority of these napping people are wearing clean, well kept clothes, and are clean-shaven.  In other words, they are just people who live/work around downtown who like a little afternoon nap.  They pick a tree, lay down, and just doze off for a little while.  I find that kind of interesting.
