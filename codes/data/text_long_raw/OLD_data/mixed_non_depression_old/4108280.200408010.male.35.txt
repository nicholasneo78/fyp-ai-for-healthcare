 Almost everyone I know online is saying BLOG. What is it I ask and after reading a few from those I know, I learned that it’s an open journal; that almost everyone online can read. “But why, isn’t a journal supposed to be private?” I asked. Some say that they want their life to be an open book and others may say “well I don’t really post everything that happened.” Still, I am a bit off with this.  So in order to know more of this, I decided to make my own so I may experience and learn about this thing called blog. This will be something from what I do and I don’t know what will happen. Only time can tell.
