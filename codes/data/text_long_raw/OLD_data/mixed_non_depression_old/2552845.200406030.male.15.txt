 Ive been talking to this girl Jessica for a while now, perhaps about 3 months. It has come to the point where we both want to officially start "seeing" each other but we lack the dating experience. What I mean by this is that we have only really gone out together twice. So she has decided that she would like to wait. But she didnt tell me this until the day after that she told me that she wanted to finally make it official. This chick seems so high maintenance that it drives me crazy. Lets say that I dont respond to her on the internet for 1 minute or more she thinks I dont want to talk to her or something else is wrong.
