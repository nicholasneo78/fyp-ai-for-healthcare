Help me figure this out
So I’m a single mom I left my boyfriend because of us arguing all the time. He has my son two days out of the week and for his birthday I gave him three to be nice (there’s a reason I don’t want him having more bc he can not handle stress) but when he dropped my son off he told me he now wants him for a week meaning I have my son one week and he gets the other but I don’t want that because I think it would be too stressful for my 10 month old so I told him I’ll take him to court which the father does not want . Things have smoothed over but I still want to go to court so this arguing over days will stop but I do not want to fuck myself over due to not having a job . I live with my mom and have a stable household but having him 5 days out of the week it’d be hard for me to get a job that will work with me . If we go to court I’d allow him three days that way I can get a decent amount of work time but if I go to court without having a job or a car would that fuck me over and give the father more time ? Any thoughts or insight would greatly help and be appreciated
