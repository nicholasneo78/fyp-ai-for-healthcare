Something my dad said has been bothering me
So a while back I decided to make some french onion soup for the first time. I don't cook very often and I'm not that good at it, so when I made the soup it seemed to turn out pretty good. I was kinda proud of my attempt and wanted my dad to try it to see what he thought of it. I brought him a small bowl to try it, and I know he was joking but it really hurt my feelings. He says to me as I hand the bowl to him, "It's not poison is it?" What do you guys think? Do you think it was just harmless joking? Or do you think he thinks I would actually do something horrible like that?
