 The first dream was that my little brother brought over season three of The Shield on DVD, but it was a poor quality rip from a VCR recording.  The second dream is that I was out on the beach with my brother and he went into the water and pulled out a morray eel and attempted to behead it. He only got down to the last string before he stopped and it was still alive and cleaning it's self like a cat. I was pretty disturbed by this so I begged him to finish the job and just put it out of it's misery. I know this one is in connection to the recent beheadings in the middle east.
