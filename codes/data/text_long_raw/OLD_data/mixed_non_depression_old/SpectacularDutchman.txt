New friends
Hi,

I’m new here. I have a huge problem. 
It’s extremely hard for me to trust people I have a bond with (friends). Out of fear of rejection or disapproval for my actions, I don’t dare to become closer. I fear people will leave me eventually, so the idea that I have friends, isn’t present. When it is present, I feel like I need to stay in touch very often. 
I feel reluctant to take initiative often. If I don’t get asked for something, it’s a strong sign I’m not wanted. This has become standardized.
I have some vague friends, but they live far away. We can’t that close, don’t share many interests, but we like each other. We can’t meet up often. 

What can I do to find new friends and do regularly something in my neighborhood. I’m close to a city, but I live in a village. I’m all day home (except for school and such), don’t feel energized to take action. Sigh. 
Getting advice like ‘find a sport, hobby, club’ doesn’t help much, I get suck. 
I feel like I don’t have even insight in the process of making friends. Or I’m not wanted. I feel like something is going wrong every time, but I don’t know what. 

Thanks in advance.
