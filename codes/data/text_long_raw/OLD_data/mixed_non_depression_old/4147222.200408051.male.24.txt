 Okie dokie, folks...my sister showed me her web log, I thought it looked cool, so I decided to start one.  I don't know how much I'll write on here; I tend to start something for a week or two, then activity falls off.  We'll see how long I can keep this one going.    I'm sure you want to know a little about me.  I currently live in a nice little suburb of Chicago called Schaumburg.  I moved up here a little over two years ago to go to law school at DePaul University, and to be slightly closer (by about 1200 miles) to the love of my life, Kristen.  I have a year left of law school (woohoo!), and then it's off to the real world.  I have a passion for three things in life: Kristen, flying, and good food.  Near-passions include country music (yee-haw), four wheel drive, good movies, and probably a bunch of other stuff that just doesn't seem to come to mind at the moment.  As I write in this, though, y'all ought to be able to figure out what I'm into and what I'm not.  Well, that's about enough for now.  Time to get cleaning (this place looks like a tornado had a wild party and all his friends were invited).  So if any of y'all have any ideas for postings, let me know.  Signing off for now.
