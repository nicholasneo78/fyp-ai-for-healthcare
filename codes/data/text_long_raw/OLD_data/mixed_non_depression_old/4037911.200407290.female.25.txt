 Okay, so maybe I'm not employee of the month.  But when it's time to work, I work hard.  It's quite annoying when a particular person sees that there is stuff to be done, but chooses to stare off into "la-la-land" instead.  They should thank their lucky stars I'm not their superior because they'd be canned on the spot if it were up to me.  You know what's weird?  When you see little kids you used to babysit back in the day, all married with kids.  No one wants to enjoy the single life anymore huh?  God dammit, that just means I'm freaking old.  Maybe I am past the finish line?  Skurrry.
