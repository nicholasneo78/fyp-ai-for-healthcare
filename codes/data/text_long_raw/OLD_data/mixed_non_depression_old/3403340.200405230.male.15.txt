 Who else loves the rain?, i know I do. And today it rained all day.  I got a chance to walk around barefoot in the woods in the rain.  I am at peace... However, tomorrow I have to get a brain scan... That ought to be a blast! nnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooootttttttttttttt. Last time I did that they made me hold my breath whenever the scanner went over me.  And the tube was really cold, yecch.  I hope all goes well, I really would rather not hear that I need some sort of surgery.  But if I do have surgery there is a pro, I get HOSPITAL SOCKS!!!!  Those are so nice, they have the little sticky pads on the bottom, and they are ever so warm.  The con of the situation is having to wear a gown.  I always imagined having to wear one, and waking up after anesthesia with a face drawn on my butt secretly, damn doctors..... I'm off te finish me book. g'night
