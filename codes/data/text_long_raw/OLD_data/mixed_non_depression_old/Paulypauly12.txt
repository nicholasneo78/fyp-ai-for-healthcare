Everything is a horrible mess, I need help
So today, my sister (29) broke up with her overseas boyfriend, and was disraught all day long, so i made lunch for her and some cake in the afternoon. About an hour ago, I was exercising in the livingroom and my sister asked me if i could make dinner and said sure, and then she asked me to do a couple other things, and I told her that i could do it tommorrow becuase it was late, then she got kinda mad and said that she'd make dinner by herself, I told her id finish exercising, then help her and she said no, i aproched her and se told me not to come any closer, my mom was watching the election results (we are from costarica), and she jumped, i was a little hurt and went to my room wothout closing the door ( we live in an apartment), my mom saw me and one thing lead to another and my mom is telling my sister to pack up an leave the house,and go to live with my father (divorced, duh) I tried telling my mom that i didnt mind what my siter said and i understood how she felt, and that i was just a little hurt but she wouldnt budge, PLEASE help me, i dont know what to do, feel or say
