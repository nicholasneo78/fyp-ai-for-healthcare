 As you may or may not have seen in the Description of the site, This is mainly a site speaking of a 16 year-old(me) who's recently switched to Mac from 13 years of using a PC.  My name is David and I'm into anime, computers, and DDR(Dance Dance Revolution).  I will speak of these things often.  My life is typically very dull, so if it sounds like I'm making something up, I probably am, you can ask me, I don't mind.  As I currently have no readers, I don't have to bother with updating or anything but i'm going to try and have a tad bit of a schedule.... so I say now.... Anyways, I hope everyone enjoys my life because I'm willing to sell it for a lot of money....heheheh... ahh... if only I was kidding.  David  PS. I'm writing this on my G4 iBook 1GHz/12.1"
