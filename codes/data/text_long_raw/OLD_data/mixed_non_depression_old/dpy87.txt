I told my friend not to go to a football game and I still went.
I'm a guy who doesn't like having to wait for others. I get things done faster on my own. He was coming an hour away and he's visiting from out of state so he doesn't know the area. Apparently he was gonna borrow a friends car but wasn't sure all before the game started in a few hours. I was like screw it I'm not dealing with this.

I basically convinced him not to go saying it was too expensive and that you'll get lost. I was being honest and he agreed. I wasn't gonna wait for him not knowing when he would arrive. I still went and I don't care. Sometimes you just have to be selfish and look out for yourself. Others can hold you back.
