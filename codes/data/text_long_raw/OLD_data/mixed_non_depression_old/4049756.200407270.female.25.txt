 Ok, so I set this up to reply to my friend Derek's blog and now I feel compelled to write something. All right, that is a lie... this is the first page it popped up to after setting up my account (again in order to respond to Derek) and I'd hate to have an empty blog and make it seem like I have nothing to say.    Big news of the day: today is the day my condo goes on the market. Yup, after over a year in glorious Chelmsford, I have decided to pack up and move back down to the Boston area. With the exception of Derek, all my friends live walking distance to the T and I count the number of times people have driven up to visit me on one hand. Ok, maybe 2, but definitely no toes! I guess I bought the place hoping to settle down there in the near future with my then beau, but things change and you need to accept that and move on, right? Hey, I may even make a profit off of it. I would accept a $20,000 mistake ;-)
