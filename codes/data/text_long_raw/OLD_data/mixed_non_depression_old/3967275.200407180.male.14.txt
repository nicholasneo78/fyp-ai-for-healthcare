 Have You Ever Noticed That Every Couple Of Years Of So, You Notice You Really Never Cared About Something. For Me, The First Thing Was The Friends Televisoin Show On The WB.  I Know It Sounds Funny, But I Almost Felt As Though I Was Growing Too Old Too Quickly. I Still Feel The Same Way. When I Was Younger, It Was Completly Different.  I Wished I Could Gett Magically Older, Or Taller So I Could Do The Things That The Older Kids Got To Do.  Now I Think About It, It Was Never Really That big Of A Deal Like I Made It Out To Be.     I'm Soo Not Ready For Highschool.  Everyone Else, It Seems, Are All Excitd, But I'm Scared. I Don't Even Know Why, Really, It's Not That I'm Afraid I'll "Get My Ass Kicked," As My Sister Says, I Think It's More About After Highschool.  I'm Afraid My Friends And I Will Sort Of Go Our Seperate Ways After Highschool.  I Mean, Shit, I Have More Trouble Just Trying To Get A Hold Of Some Of My Friends Now......
