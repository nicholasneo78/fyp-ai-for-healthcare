 One Sunday morning, a mother went in to wake her son and tell him it was time to get ready for church, to which he replied, "I'm not going."  "Why not?" she asked.  "I'll give you two reasons," he said. "One, they don't like me, and two, I don't like them."  His mother replied, "I'll give  you  two good reasons why you  should  go to church. One, you're 54 years old, and two, you're the pastor!"
