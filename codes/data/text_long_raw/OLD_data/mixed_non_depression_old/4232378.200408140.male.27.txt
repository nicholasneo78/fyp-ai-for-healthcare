 Hello and thank you for taking the time to visit my blog. To begin I am 27 years old (on 8/18/04) am I divorced father of three wonderful children whom I love with all my heart and soul. My oldest son Nick is soon to be 8 and his hobbies include looking for creepy crawlies just like every other boy you may know. Kassandra is the next in line she is daddies princess at 6yrs old she's pretty much like any other little girl bent on making boys fall before her feet while looking sweet and innocent. Then there's Tyler 4 the youngest of the group and the cohort to Nickolas anywhere nick goes so goes Tyler. As for dad well i'm into drawing fantasy art, golf, and reading the Holy Bible as I try to follow gods commands for my life. Now as I said I am a divorcee I have to mention the one woman that has come into my life and helped restore order to an otherwise stressful life Amber my fiancee as of 6/18/04 wedding planned for summer of 05. Amber is the spark in life that has opened my eyes to life after divorce she has brought to me what it's like to be truely happy in an otherwise dark world.I lOVE YOU AMBER AND KIDS
