 Well, I still didn't get paid today. Now my boss at the card shop I work at owes me $220. Hopefully I'll be getting it tommorrow (plus some extra). I had to sit in the shop ALONE for about 6 hours with only one break. Only ONE person came in. Oh well, everyone comes on Sunday anyway. ---------------------------------- I also took an IQ test about 10 minutes ago, and it said my IQ is 133. I think that's pretty good, I'm not sure exactly. I took different tests before though and they all gave me different results. So I'm not sure what my IQ REALLY is. Oh well, I really could care less.   That's all for today, see ya tommorrow!
