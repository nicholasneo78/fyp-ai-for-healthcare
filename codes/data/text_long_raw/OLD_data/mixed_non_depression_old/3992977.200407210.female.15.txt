 ON THE 4TH OF JULY I WENT TO GEAUGA       Lake. MAN I KICKED it MAN. MY SISTERS ARE SO SCARY. BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T GET ON THE X-FLIGHT OR THE BATMAN. SHE GOT ON CORNY RIDES LIKE THE TEXAS TWISTA. THAT RIDE WAS CRAZY BUT IT WASN'T NOTHING COMPARED TO THE X-FLIGHT, I MEAN YOU HAVE TO LAY  BACK ON THAT RIDE IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WAS GOING TO HIT THE GROUND OR SOMETHING. WE GOT ON ALL THE WATER RIDES, AND WE WAS IN THE WAVE POOL. A COUPLE OF PEOPLE  WAS DROWINIG. WELL GEAUGA lake DON'T GOT NOTHING ON CEDAR POINT.
