 Oh yes, it's my first blog post--I had a diary, but this thing looks oh-so-much cooler...Today was actually a lot better than I expected it to be. School was short, and non-boring. I actually didn't get an buttload of work the first day so I'm a happy kid as of right now...I probably should be in bed, but yeah I'm dumb and I'm doing this instead *woo hoo* I actually wasn't going to make one, but I wanted to post a comment on Will's thingy and it wouldnt let me without an account haha so oh well.  Yeah, I'd have to say the most interesting thing about today happened at the pool after school...I went up the mountain w/ Will to get some *more* sun so we can be super hot for our senior pics on Friday, and as we were gettin ready to leave, he got on top of my chair and gave me a kiss--well, I sat up and * BAM * my top falls off lol oh yes...good times...Yeah, it wasnt TOO funny at the time, but it kicks the shit outta me now lol That'll definitely be a good story to tell the kiddies..."Look mom, it's a girl without her top on!" ...great... haha  Well, I've still got some stuff to finish up for tomorrow--more tanning up the mountain...except this time with a broken swimsuit lol hmm, maybe it's time to get another one? Oh well, I guess I'll just go topless :)~ JUST KIDDING...geez, dont get too excited.  Ok well I'm really goin this time--leave me lots of happy comments for my blog and make me feel special!!!
