 Okay my last post wasn't that fabulous but now i'm talking about my diet.  I lost 3 pounds.  Gotta lose 12 more before school starts.  I was doing good...until I caved and ate ice cream.  I must get back on track.  Not that I'm fat but I just need to loose some weight.  Must drop weight...must drop weight...must drop weight!
