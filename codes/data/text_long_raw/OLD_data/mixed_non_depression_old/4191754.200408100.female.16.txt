 hmm... first time having a blog... guess i should start off with something interesting...  I started this blog because, i don't know, maybe bacause i really want somewhere to be able to write my deepest thoughts, my deepest feelings. Also, as someone has been pressuring me to have a blog, i guess that's why i finally gotten this blog. Umm... i'll keep this post short as i think i can foresee, my other post will be quite long. Whatever i will write here, for anyone who will ever sees my entry, please bear it ijn mind that, whatever i write down at that time, those feelings only lasted that long, negative feelings that it. Positve ones of course will last longer.  I think i'll end my post here. Adios...
