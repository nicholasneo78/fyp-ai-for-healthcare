Found out my mother has issues. What should I do?
I know it was wrong but I had a gut feeling to check her messages today when I was helping her with something on her phone. I snooped and saw that my mother has been messaging this man (I do know of him as he helped my family in a business transaction 1 year ago). 

She has been messaging him for a few months almost every other night. It dates back to a year ago but it only started looking obsessive (every other day) from approximately 5 months ago.

He has not been replying her. If it's a reply, its extremely rare. It's constant double blue ticks (means he read the message) on whatsapp. What should I do? I'm not sure if my mum realises that this is a creepy act or that she's bothering him because he hasn't said a single word or that she's doing it cause she's lonely and confused.

My mum is 55+ and she's been divorced for 19 years now. I'm really not sure what to do or how to react to this situation as it totally caught me offguard. Please help.
