 It's true, mobile phones are great devices.  I've had one since i was 13, plan of course, not shitty pre paid which Evan always complains about, and, I've always had a regular wage earning job to pay for my phone bill.  But why are phones so great? Because they are becoming more stable, smaller/bigger, better battery life and more reliable.  I change phones every now and again, having had the ever popular Nokia 3310 for 2.5 years, followed by a Sony Ericsson T610 for 8 months, an N-Gage (POS) for a month, a Nokia 7650 for a month (old, but top phone), and currently, have a brand spanking new Sony Ericsson K700 in my possession which I've had for the last week, not even out here yet. Take a look at my precious:  http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_k700-692.php  New, small, super tankish battery life, and a whole load of features. And yes, I can control my mobile phone bill, but a phone is essential for me as I need to be picked up from all the places I go, unless otherwise catching public transport.  But, Evan is against the 90% or whatever it is of Australians that own and use a mobile phone.
