How does it affect my parents if I do drugs?
I’m 22, I’m an adult and have legally been an adult for the past 6 years, one of my favourite passtimes is taking drugs, I like to get stoned, high and buzzed, I like the feeling and it makes me feel nice, it’s a nice feeling, but my parents keep getting on my case for me smoking skunk or doing Charlie behind their back, but it doesn’t affect them, because I don’t do it in the house so they will never be affected legally by it and if I get arrested it’s on me not them, do you see my point? They’re treating me like a baby?
