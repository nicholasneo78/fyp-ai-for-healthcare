Frustrating Friend
So my friend loves to catch up for coffee. Invites 10 or so of us to one session to catch up with as many of us as possible.
I'm a SAHM with a nearly 3 year old and 8 weeks off giving birth to my second. I'm also dealing with my husband being in a new job so it's a new routine for our boy. It's also a 40 minute bus ride into the city each time, maybe longer sometimes coz our weather is crap most of the time (take note).
My friend knows this but constantly badgers me to come for coffee whenever HE has free time. He just started a new job as of yesterday. Before this he had free time 24/7.
I told him in a huge message how my circumstances make it hard to just head into the city when he asks and that I can manage it on days I have midwife appointments.
He replied that he had just as much responsibilities that he had to deal with but he managed to still come into town to visit everyone. 
It feels like he just ignored what I was saying and that meeting him was more important.
Soooo frustrated!! What do I do? Am I a crap friend or does he need to understand where I'm coming from better?
