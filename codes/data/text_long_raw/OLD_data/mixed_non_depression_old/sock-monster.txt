Cheap gifts on the Receiver's side
My friend and I are friends for about 5 years. We ended up going to different colleges, but kept in contact online. I think of them as my best friend, but i'm not sure if it is reciprocated. 

Every year I stress about giving a good gift for their birthday and xmas. A gift too expensive makes them feel uncomfortable by setting expectations. A gift too cheap devalues our friendship and being on the receiving end feels terrible. 

I purchased their birthday gift is about $12 (Lush soap), and the Christmas gift is about $8-10 (sweets). The price of the cards are not included. 

They got me a small notepad that looked like it came from the dollar store for my birthday, and a couple stickers for Xmas. There was no card included or even a piece of paper that had my name on it.  

Last year they got me a $15 gift with the receipt for my birthday. My gifts were around the same value (~$15).

I try not to place too much importance on the price tag, since it is the thought that counts, but their gift to me is really cheap (~$1-2), and looked like it was slapped together an hour before we met. I know they can afford to buy a gift. They buy coffee every couple days and bought lunch to the point where the staff remembered their order. 

I accepted their gift, but it was really hard to avoid showing my disappointment. I honestly thought it would of been better if they just didn't give me a gift at all.

Is this a sign? Are they trying to tell me something or do they really think of me so little? I'm not sure what they are thinking or what should I do. 

I know giving them a similarly cheap gift is an option, but I would rather know why they thought to give me this gift. I could also brush this off as a one time thing, but I think that this is not the case.
