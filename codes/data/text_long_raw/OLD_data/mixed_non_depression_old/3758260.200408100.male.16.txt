 It has, indeed, been a while since my last post on this site.  This is because I have been very busy, be it school, post office, baker's delight, goal umpiring, homework or gym, give or take a few hours sleep here and there.  Not much has changed, added gym to the routine, going well so far. Funds saving is at an all time low, but with the extra worked hours at the post office are quickly sky rocketing into buying stuff land.
