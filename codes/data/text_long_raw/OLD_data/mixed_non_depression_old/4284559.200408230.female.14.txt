 Well, for a Monday, things turned out pretty well!  I mean, I hurt a girl's feelings (Kurtis's friend Cassie), I think Justin is gonna ask me out, and i just wrote a letter to Chasen!  How exciting, huh?  Not really.  I didn't get to go to the fair Saturday because it rained most of the day.  I didn't get to go to the football game Friday because stupid Travus never called me back!  I am so mad at him by the way.  But what do I expect from Travis. I mean, it's him!  Anyhoo . . . I talked to Luke about Chasen and he says to just tell him the truth about how I feel!  Yeah, well, even if I did tell him the truth he wouldn't believe me or take me back!  That would be giving him my time that he doesn't need or want.  Kurits just called to say what's up.  How nice.  I made a buddy profile for my AIM screen name.  It is pretty cool.  I don't know.  I like it whether anyone else does or not.  Well, I am gonna leave for now.  I will probably be back later.  I am talking to Kurtis so I am getting kinda confused.   Hehe.  Talk to yuh later.  PEACE!  Love yuh bye, Crystal
