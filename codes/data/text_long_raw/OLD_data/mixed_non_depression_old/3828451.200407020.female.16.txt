 well well well, i starting a new blog b/c im bored and my friend thought that this would be a good idea. But today was not a good day for me though. I was going to go watch a movie, Spiderman 2 today with friends, so got up around 8:30am today and started my cleaing early so i wouldn't have to worry about it later in the day and can get ready for the movies too. So i walked toward my room and this dumb crate was in my way and i stubbed my baby toe on the crate and part of my toe nail came off and i broke it, eerrr! It seems as though bad things only happen to me, oh well. But all day i was in freak'n pain and didn't think much about it untill the sharp pain started getting worse and worse through out the day. So now im on pain killers that are making me feel so weird and in a twilight zone it seems like, that i've been trying to sleep through out the whole day to get my mind off the pain. I even tried to watch BarberShop 2 which didn't work b/c my mind was defiantly on my pain. I thought that i can really take pain but i thought wrong lol. But i guess i'll get my booty to bed and sleep!!
