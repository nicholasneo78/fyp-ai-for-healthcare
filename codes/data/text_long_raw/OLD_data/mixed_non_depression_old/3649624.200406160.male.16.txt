 Damn I'm tired...I woke up early as shit today: 12 o'clock.  I know there are a few of you tittering at that, and I thank you.  It's really not as easy as it looks to be funny.  I mean it.  Was that a sentence fragment?    Anyways.  I've decided to buy some fish.  I'm thinking guppies...but I may go exotic.  I'm dreading tomorrow because my dad informed me that I have to cut the grass.  I really don't want to say anything seeing as to how I've cost them over 14 thousand dollars in the past 5 weeks.  I figure that cutting the grass is the LEAST and is the very MOST I will do to make it up to them (yeah right).  How much money have you guys cost your parents?  I bet I beat you!  I really need to stop joking about this...it's starting to sound like I don't care, and I really really do.  I feel like shit.  I barely ate anything yesterday.  I had a footlong sub from Subway and some watermelon.  That watermelon was awesome.  I'm really ready for school to start back because I found out that if I don't have anything to occupy myself, I tend to bring on a lot of trouble.
