Don't know what to do.
I have an older sibling who I don't see anymore. Cut a long story short, when she was younger she didn't like the way she was parented and basically reported my parents. She was taken off them and placed into a care setting. She is now a lot older and I have seen her a couple of years ago but we have lost contact all of a sudden. I never use to be allowed to speak to her because apparently she was trouble. But I miss my sister because she is still my sister. She used to always say I could go see her when I'm 16 and my parents can't tell me what to do. What do I do in this situation?
