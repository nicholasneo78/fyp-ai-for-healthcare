 I am quite new to this kind of "expressing yourself in writing" stuff. I don't know why many of my friends got addicted to blogger. I said to myself ... "Hmm .. why not give it a try.  Perhaps the major obstacle that always keeps me from writing in web is being afraid of what other people are gonna say about my writing. But I realize that this is not about showing off how many vocabularies you've had so far, it's about "expressing yourself" dude.. well I hope .. and i really hope it could be a continous habit for me besides studying for my master degree and guitaring ... coz i know this is a really good habit !
