 Well now that Kerry selected a running mate, the election will start heating up.  My support goes towards are current and great President.  However, I am a little worried about his chances.  Everywhere I turn I hear how so many people hate him, he is constantly getting bashed everywhere you go, and for some reason other than talk shows the GOP isn't fighting back.  This was the same mistake his dad made, and I think this election is too important to lose to someone who has yet to take a stand on any of the major issues (Hey Kerry we know you wouldn't have sent troops, but we are there now so what would you do now if you were in office?) All I can tell people is to actually look at facts instead of read opinions, and at least make an informed decision.
