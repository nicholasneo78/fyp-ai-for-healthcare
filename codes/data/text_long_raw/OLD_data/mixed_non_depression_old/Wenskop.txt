Should I attempt to repair our friendship one last time?
So a few months ago a close friend and I had a sort of fight because I made a shitty passive aggressive comment.

I apologised shortly afterwards and felt terrible about it, even apologised more a day later.

Anyhow they said they needed some space, we happened to work together and sit right next to each other. So I left them be for awhile, they basically refused to even look or speak to me. After a month or so this started to take its toll on me, emotionally and mentally I wasn't equipped to deal with it. 

So eventually after 66 days of this, something I could not get away from I snapped and out of desperation as I was losing my mind I told I'm walking away as without communication the friendship is doomed.

So that's where it ended, they then carried on ignoring me for the rest of our time at work, they eventually left to go to a new place. Even at the farewell I was ignored till the last 10 minutes then got some communication.

After that a couple weeks later on my birthday they randomly wished me a happy birthday on a work group. Completely unexpected, sadly this confused the shit out of me and I drunkenly sent some message about being tired of all the hurt. Then I was blocked. I have since not contacted them in any way for over a month.

Do I make another attempt and how would I word it or should I just leave it and see if anything happens, we were really close and I feel awful about hurting them. It was the only argument in a year and a half we had.
