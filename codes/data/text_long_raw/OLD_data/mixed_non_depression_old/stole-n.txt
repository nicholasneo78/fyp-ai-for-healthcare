Sick of this
I'm tired of being the one that always has to write to people.. if I wouldn't do that, I feel that they won't talk to me until they need me to do something for them. I hate that I always get so attached to the people I bond with.. and what sucks more is the fact that I feel this thing is not reciprocal.
