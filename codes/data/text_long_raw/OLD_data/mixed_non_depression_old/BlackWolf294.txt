Advice to restore lost friendship?
My cousin and I used to be best friends when we were little. We told each other everything and were inseparable. Then, a bunch of terrible stuff happened to her around middle school and in high school. She shut herself away. Even though we used to tell each other everything, she didn't talk to me as much after that. I love her, and I wanted her to know she could trust me, like she always could. But she didn't talk to me. Or anyone else. 

Then she moved a whole state away for a couple years. We drifted apart. Far apart. I used to consider her my very best friend, but at that point I didn't feel that way anymore. She now lives close to me again, and we have started hanging out again. I feel like we are starting to get our friendship back, but I still feel like there is something preventing us from getting back to how we used to be when we were little. She has depression and anxiety as a result of everything she has been through. I want her to know I am there for her and that she can trust me completely.

I do know her well enough that I can tell when she is having a hard time with something, and today, I could tell she was struggling. I asked how she was doing, and she was upset because she and her boyfriend have been fighting a lot lately. I asked her more about it, but she didn't want to talk about it. That's completely fine; I understand. And I told her as much and also let her know I am always here for her if she needs anything.

Now, I say all of that to ask this: how can I let her know that she can open up to me without sounding too pushy? I want to regain what we once had. How can I restore that closeness we used to have?
