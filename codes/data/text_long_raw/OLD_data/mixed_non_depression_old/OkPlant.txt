Conservative republican parents &amp; liberal arts educated democrat child...what could go wrong?
I grew up in a poor household, but was able to use this to my advantage to get scholarships to private school and an elite liberal arts college. After graduating from school and coming back home, I realized that I have absolutely nothing in common with my parents anymore. They do not understand the concept of privilege, think everyone on welfare is lazy, voted for Trump and defend him and every time I get legitimately pissed off at them, they say that the school I went to brainwashed me and made me crazy and in doing so they completely invalidate all the hard work and effort I had to put in not only to get into this school, but working two jobs while there and still maintaining a 3.5 GPA. I was a sociology major, too, so these issues are literally what I spent most of my four years studying. It's now at the point where I cannot have a conversation with my father without it blowing up. It gets worse by the issue and the WORST part is that they are decent and loving people. Is there anyone else on here who is in a similar situation? What do you do? I'm slowly losing my mind trying to argue at this point. And moving out is the obvious solution, but I don't just want to run away from people who disagree with me and like, I don't pay rent.
