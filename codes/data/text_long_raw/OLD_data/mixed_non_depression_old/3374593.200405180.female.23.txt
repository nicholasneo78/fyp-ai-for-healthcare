 Well I do not have any high hopes about this blog since it is my first one!  I shall just ramble a little bit and then go looking at the other capabilities of this site.  Currently I am sitting in work winding away my time until dinner.  It is a beautiful day today and I have my office window open, my office is situated below the canteen, the food smells are wafting down and making my tummy rumble.  My lunch today is of the packed lunch variety, cheese sandwich, plain crisps and a flapjack.  Not very healthy I know.  It was made in haste this morning as  my car was parked in  a space that was not paid for outside my flat!  Well after that initial interesting reverie regarding the delights of my lunch, I will sign off!  Greetings to all.  Bo xx
