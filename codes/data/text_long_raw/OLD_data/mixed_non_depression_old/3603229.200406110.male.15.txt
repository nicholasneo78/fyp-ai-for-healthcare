 I had drivers ed again today starting at 8:00 a.m. till 10:30 a.m. My mom drive me up there and I had to ride my bike home sense my dad was working and couldn't pick me up. Then when I got home, after about 30 min of sitting and watching t.v., my dad wanted me to cut the grass. So I had to do that, took me about 45 min and during that time, my friend Andy called. Went over to his house after I was done. Played some 21 and some smackdown for ps2. When I came home, my mom and I went to pick up some mcdonalds. My mom got a big mac which had a free download code for www.connection.com. Got a free music download, along with one that Andy gave to me cause he got one from his work for free. He happens to work for mcdonalds too. When I got done with that, I came online and sat around watching t.v. like I am doing right now. :) another fun day.
