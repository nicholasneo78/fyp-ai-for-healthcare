 So we did the Oklahoma thing.  It was actually a very beautiful lake.  On Saturday, as soon as we got into OK, it started pouring.  We were worried that our fun-filled weekend would be ruined because of the rain.  We had nothing to do.  We decided to see DODGEBALL, which was silly.  When we came out of the movies, the sun was out and the sky started to clear.  We dashed over to the lake to rent a kayak.  It was really nice and not too hot since it had been raining all day.  We then ate dinner at a local restaurant.   Sunday's weather was better.  My husband enjoyed the scuba diving, though it was not my cup of tea.  I am not certified and just sat on the shore, under the trees, trying to avoid the sun.  I told him that I might not go with him the next time he decided to dive, since it is not very interesting for me.  I know he enjoys it so much, but is definitely not a spectator sport.   I am teaching classes in a summer program for high school students.  It is going well, though some of the kids don't seem to care very much about the program.  They seem to be determined to get kicked out of the program (which will provide college tuition upon successful completion ).  I don't know.  Hopefully these kids will wake up and realize that this is a unique opportunity before they are removed.  I know that they deal with difficult stuff at home - things that I never had to deal with. . . .
