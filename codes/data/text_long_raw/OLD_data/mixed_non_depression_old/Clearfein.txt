Wish I could tell my family how much I hate them
Was adopted by my aunt after being taken into CPS. Prior to, my father passed, after , my mother. My aunt and gma want me to “watch” basketball w them.. I hate my aunt, like my gma, but I utterly hate watching sports w them. So boring. One day I’ll just have to let them know how much grief it brings me just to sit with them. Maybe I shouldn’t lmao. But then they wonder why I looks so somber around them.. seems like I definitely have some sort of social anxiety disorder or something idk. Really just hate everyone and myself. Life sucks 😂.
