 Below you'll find a pic of the place we now call home.  Its in Takoma Park - what I consider to be the finest subset of DC.  We're in a real neighborhood, with friendly neighbors and treelined streets, but we're still a 4 min walk from the metro, and a 20 min ride from downtown.  It comes at a price, though, and there are a few things wrong with the house.  In fact, I'm about to go check to ensure the basement didn't flood last night!  That said, I couldn't be happier with it.  Don't you love our faux stone?
