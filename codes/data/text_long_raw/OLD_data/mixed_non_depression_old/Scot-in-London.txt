How to ask someone to move out.
TL:DR Friend has overstayed their welcome, how to politely ask her to leave?

4 months ago, my friend was going through a rough time.  She had split up with her partner and was struggling to find somewhere to live. My fiance and I own our home and had a spare room so offered her to stay, till her work contract was up in February, for a very very low rent (it's a quarter of what people pay in our area).  So now we're in february she has a renewed contract at work and isn't looking at places to live.  Little things she does around the house bug me, but thats probably just because its our home and not a shared rental.  However recently I've suffered a string of ill health (multiple hospital admissions) and now i'm home I just want my own space! She has cut her work hours to look for a new job but barely looks and just sits around the house.  I feel like i'm cleaning up after her all the time, plus she is always eating our food.  At the moment I am struggling to keep on top of my own mess let alone hers.  How can I go about asking her to move out without losing the friendship?
