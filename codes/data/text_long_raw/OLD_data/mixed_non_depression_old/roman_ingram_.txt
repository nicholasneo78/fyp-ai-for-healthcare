iâ€™m 18 and my parents treat me like a little kid....
i've always grown up in a strict home but my parents take it too far 
my sister was always the fav and got everything or stuff sooner even if she paid for part 
just got a laptop for my 18th bday and my parents made me pay for half bc "they have to be fair bc of my sister" yet she got hers when she was 14 and got to keep it 
one night i stated up until 12 am watching netflix bc i was stressed and my mom wakes up and takes my laptop.... I PAID HALF AS AN 18 BDAY PRESENT 
-they're judgmental 
-force religion on me and won't let me skip a day of church 
-make me give them my phone and laptop (paid for half) on school nights at 9:30 
-won't let me start paying for my phone 
-bed time is 9:30 
-curfew is 9 on weekdays and 11:30 on weekends 
-they track my phone and flip out for any and everything in general 
-contact others without my permission and speak on my behalf if they have a problem 
-hypocrites and don't listen when we argue 
-act like i'm a little kid 
-freaked out just bc they caught me w my vape 
-won't let me skip a period of class and are so paranoid about my attendance 
-sexist towards other girls 
-i take meds for depression and anxiety but they don't care about my feelings only if it applies to them 
-nosey and invades my privacy 
basically i'm 18 and i get no freedom and i have a B+ average in school.... tbh when i move out i don't want to make any contact w them and i'll prob do stuff i couldn't do at home like partying late etc. 
what do i do?
