So dramatic ðŸ˜ª
My best friend and I were in the same school ever since we were 4 years old. But then, I had to leave for a different high school while she stayed with most of our friends. We didnâ€™t grow apart, but we spent most of our time with different people, which can change a person. Iâ€™d like to think that I did not change a whole lot (probably true :â€™) ) but my best friend has been hanging out with some of our friends and theyâ€™ve been affecting her attitude in a way, and sheâ€™s starting to become the same people we would always laugh at for being stupid and ignorant and petty. We talked about it and she agrees thatâ€™s sheâ€™s changed, but doesnâ€™t want her change to affect our friendship. What do you think we should do?
