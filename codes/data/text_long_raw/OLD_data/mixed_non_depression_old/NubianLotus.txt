Dealing with a narcissistic mother
Ok. I live at home after graduating from college with my mom because I'm in the process of planning my career and finding a job to move out eventually. The thing is its like being in hell when you have a mother with clear mental problems bullying you all the time. She constantly needs attention and if she doesn't get it she changes the locks or threatens me with an eviction notice or tries to remove all the food from the house knowing I don't have anywhere to go and I'm doing all I can as fast as I possibly can to move out. I don't eat much because even if I consume a dollar to 4 dollars worth of food a week she still says I'm eating her out of house and home. I work on my portfolio from sunrise to sunset daily so I'm in my room 90 percent of the time but she accuses me of being secretive because she can't know every little thing I do. She doesn't believe in boundaries and my mental health has suffered greatly because of it. It is now to the point where I've become severely suicidal at times because I feel as if every step I take to start my life away from here she pulls me back 5. What should I do?  I have no where else to live or go.
