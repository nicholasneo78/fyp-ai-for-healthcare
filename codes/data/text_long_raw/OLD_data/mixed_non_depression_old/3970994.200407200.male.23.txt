 Arghh .. I barely could move single part of my bodies, I was really burned out from yesterday's workout.  Adit asked me to join him to gym and I said, "Hell Yeah ! Bring it On .." but a little voice from my heart said,"are u serious about this?" Well .. I dragged myself to Gym because I need to.  Thanks to my supportive girlfriend that said I could be able to do my all kinds of activities much faster from working out since it would stimulate both of your mind and body.  Well i think it's time for me to do my routinity, back to school in an hour and thanks God the Prof is not that boring.  O yeah .. forgot to mention about yesterday's activities .... it was a combo-day ! I did a lot of stuffs in only a single day ... i did practice of trying to imitate the solo of Dewa and Joe Satriani with my Fender Strato, I studied and worked on my homework (Finally! this is a rare thing to do), going to Gym (ran about almost 1 mile, lifted up some of machines, basketball and soccer), and called my GF =). At nite, my girlfriend threw out some matters that almost startled me ... I was surprised but on the other hand I said to myself, it;s really common to have those.   I tried to lessen her burdens, sometimes I do really want to remove all the burdens what she's got but I couldn't ... maybe I am also struggling with the same problem ...  Hopefully someday, the day when we 've matured enough would retrieve the solution. We often discussed many things and if we somewhat hurt one another's feeling, one of us standed up and said sorry. So the problem ended on that day.  Oh ... I need to prepare myself going to shcool, haven't taken a shower and breakfast ...  signed off
