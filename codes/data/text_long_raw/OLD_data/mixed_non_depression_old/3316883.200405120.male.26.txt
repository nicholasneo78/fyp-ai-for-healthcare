 Hi   I do not known if i will be able to write about my life all the time. I am not used of speaking a lot. First, let me introduce myself. I am 26 year old, i am french ( yes nobody's prefect) and my friends says that i'm prbably one of the less down-to-earth guy they've ever met !!!   What coul I add. I'm playing guitar, have a idea on everyting (eh pal, i'm French !!!) and i'm gay. Well, i have to leave you today but i'm determined to come back very soon. See you later on the great world of internet.
