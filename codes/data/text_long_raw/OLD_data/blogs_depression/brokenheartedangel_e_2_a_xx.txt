I'm 17 years old I live in the metro Detroit area and I have had depression for the past 5 years, my parents refuse to admit I have a problem, at one point I used to cut myself and at another point I was rushed to the ER to get my stomach pumped from trying to over dose. Basically I joined this forum so I can realize for myself I'm not the only one with problems. My depression has gotten a lot better over the years as certain situations got better too; I have a loving boyfriend whom I have been with for 14 months now, which I'm extremely sure that he has helped me. Next year, well in the fall I will be moving away to college, which I actually think will be a good thing for me. I am also a cheerleader at my school, which doesn't help with my depression I am constantly under pressure about that. I'm also a dancer, my parents have this thing where they like to find every little thing I do wrong. It seems as if nothing I do is good enough or right. Which has lead to my wanting to be alone and not eating. With the stress of dance and cheerleading and my parents constantly telling me I'm fat has lead me to only eat once or twice every other day. I know it is not healthy and I know it is not good, but I personally think its better then cutting and better then trying to overdose on pain killers and every other pill in the house. Thanks for listening.
