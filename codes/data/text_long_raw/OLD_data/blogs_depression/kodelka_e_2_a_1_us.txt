I went to Lauren's place last night with Lee and watched Takashi Miike's Audition with them and Loro's boyfriend Thomas. It was great. Especially for a Friday the 13th. I can't wait to see Ichi the Killer with them. Oh, and Visitor Q! I don't think I've ever known anyone who can sit through his movies and enjoy them with me, rather than be grossed out and run away. Hah! Yay! Hurray for sick fuckers! I panicked at work just before 5:00pm on Friday and ended up calling my doctor to schedule an appointment so that I could get back onto my medication. I thought I would be fine without it. After all, it's been about a month now. My eyes water at the mere mentioning of something upsetting and I've been getting frustrated really easily. Whether I like it or not, I'm going to need to stay on it. Hopefully not forever. I just started to become really worried because orientation for Chili's has begun and this coming two weeks are going to be full-on training. I can't afford to lose it since I already gave my notice in at the shop. I went on a shopping spree at work to get a few things I've had my eye on so that I could still get a discount. Is that bad? Meh.
