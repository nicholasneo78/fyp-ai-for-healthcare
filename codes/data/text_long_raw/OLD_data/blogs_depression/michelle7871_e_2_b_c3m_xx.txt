i have been taking paxil for 3 weeks . i was on cymbalta for 1 month before my paxil. now i have only had one good day so far. i feel like crap it's scary. i even went to have a aids test along with my blood work because i feel so awful. my hands and feet sweat so bad i drench my shirts . this sucks for a girl .i get hot flashes so much i have to sleep with a fan in my face i hate this and am so worried about the way i feel . is this normal?
