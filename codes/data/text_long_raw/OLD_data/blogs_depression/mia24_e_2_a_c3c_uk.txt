it's 3am and i can't sleep. i have got so many thoughts rushing through my head. i've tried writing them down and drawing pictures and doing mind numbing things to try and stop me thinking but it's not working. i just feel so angry for no particular reason.

i feel really violent and have been having thoughts about hurting people. i'm not that kind of person. i haven't cut for nearly 2 months, and i just attacked my legs with a broken glass because i had to get it out of my system somehow.

i don't know what's going on, i haven't been depressed lately i've been feeling pretty good really. i thought i was just getting things back under control and now whoosh i'm losing control again. i just want to stop thinking. i'm actually thinking about banging my head against the wall until my brain slows down.
