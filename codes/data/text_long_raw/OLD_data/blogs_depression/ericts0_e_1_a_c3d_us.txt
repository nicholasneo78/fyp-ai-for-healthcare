I've never posted on here before but i feel like i need to.  I no longer care about school or anything.  I want to kill myself and i keep thinking about it and I'm going to continue to think about it.  I have been doing drugs lately to try and keep from going insane in this town.  I'm alone for most of my days.  I don't really have parents to go home to, like my other friends.  I'm 16 in case anyone's wondering.  I am alone every night and i'm tired of being alone ..... there is nothing here for me, no life.  I'm going to keep doing drugs and i hope i kill myself.  I'm sure my family cares, i know they do but they can't help me.  I don't want to see a doctor, i want to die.  I have no motivation, i can't concentrate in school.  I'm not planning on being around for a while.  I can't handle being alone anymore ..... my dad is always with his girlfriend .... all the time, i never spend any time with my mom or dad ..... it doesn't really matter now anyway, it's all too late.
