No doubt in my mind that since I have been taking Zoloft,  I do dream a  lot more and sometimes very vividly.  Most of mine don't make any sense either ... but on occasion, my remembered dreams are so real,  it's almost spooky.  (If only those dreams were somewhat romantic, well then I wouldn't be bringing this up, would I? ... lol)

Another thing I noticed is that if I'm asleep and my cell phone rings, I get up, walk a few feet away,  answer, carry a short conversation and afterwards, I have no recollection whatsoever.  It reminds me of sleep walking.  That is so unusual and strange to me.

You are not alone xxx :-)  and I am so glad you're feeling much better!
