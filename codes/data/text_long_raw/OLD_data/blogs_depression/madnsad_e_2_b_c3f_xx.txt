i am mad and sad, i suffer from depression i have a problem with my family, at first i thought i had a problem but more and more i see that it's not me the only problem is everybody else say it's me ......  i have three sisters who are all older than me they try to control every aspect of my life. i am 27 years old last june i lost my job and had to move with one of my sisters at first things were fine and then she started to degrade me in front of her friends i tried to ignore her for about 3 months she was verbally abusive to both me and my children i did everything i could to keep the house clean and please her but she always found a reason to dog me out one day we had an argument and i stood up for myself and she was on the phone with a friend while doing so,  later on that day her friend called me and invited me and my children to stay with her at first i was scared because i didn't know her well and i didn't know what my sister had already told her about me but i didn't want to take my kids to the shelter they had already experience so much.  so i moved with the friend who is very caring and understanding and my depression was ok for a while.  i was waiting on a low income apartment and they finally called but meanwhile my mom told me my sisters were upset because none of us has ever depended on anyone outside of the family and i am stupid and betrayed the family. but every time i need my family they are never there and if they are they give you lectures and tell everyone your business so i feel alone confused and when i move i don't want to be bothered but i don't have any friends and i don't want to isolate myself because it is unhealthy am i wrong to not want to be bothered or is this a classic case of me being selfish and not wanting to hear the truth from my family below i will give a brief history someone please help!

been on my own since age 17, never been without work, love my children with all my heart, was in a great relationship but family didn't like him so , you know what happened! and never got into any family politics always accepted all for who they were, and finally when diagnosed with depression at age 19 everyone i know told me i am depressed because i want to be and i could change if i chose to .  what should i do?
