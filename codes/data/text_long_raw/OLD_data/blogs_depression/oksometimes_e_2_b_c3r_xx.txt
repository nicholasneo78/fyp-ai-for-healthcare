I really wanted to go to the chat room today. but I'm at work and I don't think these computers allow it. I just really need someone to talk to. I am so sick of being this unsatisfied brat I just got a new job doing what i went to school for, and I hate it.  I feel like such a fake .. so pointless. i feel like no matter what i do it doesn't matter I am always going to be unhappy like the grass is always going to be greener where I am not.  I've taken personality tests and they say this is my personality. i don't want this personality. i want to be happy like other people.  well i say other people, but to be honest i don't know anyone that i would consider happy. everyone just seems to go on with life just kind of doing what they're supposed to i think happiness is a lie.  the only people i know that seem to be okay are alcoholics and druggies.  so you know they're not really ok. lately i've just been trying to fill the huge empty hole that my life is.  it's such a load of crap.  my husband says he loves life but he can't go one day without smoking stuff or drinking a 6 pack and i just want to scream at him LIAR.  and he tells to appreciate it because one day its going to end.  and you know what , i know he's right, but i find myself thinking that that would be such a weight off my shoulders no pain no worries no hassles no nothing. just over.  just done with all this stupid bullshit and the lies. somewhere i learned that life is supposed to be easy once you reach a certain point or succeed at certain things.  but that is so wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!! life will never be easy i will always be dealing with this crap and that makes me so sad and so wishing i were dead.
