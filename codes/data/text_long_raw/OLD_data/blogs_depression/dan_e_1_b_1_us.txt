Glad I can help! Firelizardee has helped me a lot over on the effexor room (that's where most of my posts are). I've never really posted my story, but for what it's worth, here it is: I live in northern New York State where I grew up on the family farm. My brother and I run a feed/hardware/farm supply store. I've got a terrific wife and two daughters ages 1 and 3. My depression hit in January during a bout with the flu; my youngest daughter was hospitalized with febrile seizures and that might be what put me over the edge. My nervous breakdown seemed to come out of the blue, but I'd had an extremely stressful six months between job, illness, and adoption.  I'm also a hard driving firstborn perfectionist, and several family members have had alcoholism or suspected depression. So I guess depression should not have been so big a surprise, but it was. I'm a happy person with a great life! But I feel like I've been right to the edge of the precipice and looked down at Hell. Now I'm doing everything I can to ensure I don't relapse.....but I actually think I'm a better person having been through this. I'm much more appreciative of a 'good day' and I'm much more attuned to the suffering of others. It's amazing how many people I know have similar problems. And I hate that it has to be this way, but suffering does bring me closer to God. I hardly dare say that depression and anxiety was 'worth it'....the memory of the anguish is still too vivid, and besides, it could come back tomorrow. But right now, today, I feel more contented with my crazy, precious, stupid, dear, wasted, amazing life than I have been in years. I'm very lucky to have stumbled onto the right medication the first time, and to have a supportive family that didn't tell me to 'snap out of it'. And I'm very lucky to have the people here in this forum, who know what it's like. I hope, tvk, that in a few weeks you too will be a recovering depression survivor. Till then, we're here when you need us!
