I've been having a difficult time lately. In addition to my mental state of disarray, I have a medical condition that can affect my mood. My medication has changed lately; my body hasn't caught up the difference yet. The last few days have been particularly bad, especially at night. The familiar sensation lurks again on my upper leg. Scissors. Half-dozen lines -- my usual, though in the past I would sometimes keep cutting until my self-hatred was momentarily spent. Pressure on the blade to force the skin to gape slightly and bleed more. I am not proud. I knew it wasn't the best way to cope. I did at least take the precautions of using a sharp blade, knowing that a jagged blade could leave a jagged wound, and of lavish aftercare. I washed it out with rubbing alcohol, which causes renewed bleeding but was necessary to keep everything clean and infection-free. Covered everything with a jumbo Band-Aid, the kind kids put on skinned knees, and haven't dared to look since. Afterward, I was afraid that I was back to my old ways. I told myself in near-hysterics that this was strictly a one-time backslide. The surprising part is that I believed myself. This does not make me a cutter again. This does not mean that I have lost everything that I've gained. All it means is that I have been having an extraordinarily bad time and resorted to extraordinary behavior in order to cope. My situation will improve. My body chemistry will even out. It's better not to cut, but I am not a bad person even if I do cut. The words are stupidly simple. I don't care. They are my magic that keeps me going.
