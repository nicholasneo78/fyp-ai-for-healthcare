just wondering, if there is anyone out there at this time, how do you stop yourself from self - harming when the going gets so tough you start to disassociate? I have been taking my absolute limit of PRN medication, but feel like if I phone a helpline it is all going to be too trivial. My home support nurse has told me I need to stop taking the PRN meds NOW but i've tried and I can't. The urge is so great I can nearly guarantee that by the time I get to bed I will have hurt myself again. PLEASE tell me what helps you in this situation ...
