I went on 6weeks. FMLA almost two years ago for depression, GAD and Panic Disorder. I felt uncomfortable when I went back, after having had the same position for 25 yrs, but I'm still there, and no one made a big deal about it when I came back. I'm still on medicines for depression and have a ton of anxiety, which the medicines help with. I'm able to function in a fast paced environment where things change every day. I can sleep, which is great as I put off going in for treatment and was beat when I finally got on medicines, had lost weight, and was headed for agoraphobia. Medicines and some therapy work well for me. I can't deny that I had myself under one ton of stress and had no outlets. I found out the hard way that there's more to life than work, work, work. One has to find a way to relax, too.
