I am screaming inside. I want to cry. My eyes are burning, ready to cry. At least it's something... A feeling. It has taken me so much time to work up the courage to call a psychiatrist. I told myself no matter how I am feeling I am going to call. I researched and found who's supposed to be the best. I called and was referred to a local chapter; not taking new patients. They referred me to a place where the psychiatrist isn't taking new patients but the psychologists are. They asked me what kind of treatment I needed!! "Do you need a therapist or do you need a psychiatrist" All of this was after I worked so hard explaining my life long depression with and without circumstantial reasons. I AM NOT THE DOCTOR. HOW DO I KNOW WHAT I NEED!! BOTH!!! I set the appt, but I think I need access to both a therapist and a psychiatrist. I canceled, and I feel so horrible. Don't they know how hard it was for me to call? I am upset right now. I want to give up, but I know I will have to call someone else. Why does it have to be so hard?
