I have been in two accidents one in October (went to take pictures of my sister in the parade, she was nominated for homecoming queen), and one in February. The first accident really messed not only my mind, but my body up. Now I am 23, and have severe back, shoulder, and knee pain that I have been treated for, and other pain that I just refuse to go to the doctor for (all from the first accident). I have done the specialist thing, and physical therapy. Nothing has made me feel better other than temporarily (if all I do physically is nothing). I can't work, clean, or do anything I enjoy without it making the pain worse. I am at my witsi end. I am in the deepest hole I have ever been in. I can't take having to choose between mental stability, and physical stability anymore. Some days I wonder why I even get out of bed. Nothing good comes out of it. I would give anything in the world to feel better. Last night I just cried myself to sleep, because I am not the only person dealing with this. I take my emotions out on everyone around me including my husband. Lately I can't help, but think he deserves better. I suppose I don't think I know. Sorry for ranting like this, but I just needed to get all of this out of my head. I thought if it wasn't in there it wouldn't bother me so much.
