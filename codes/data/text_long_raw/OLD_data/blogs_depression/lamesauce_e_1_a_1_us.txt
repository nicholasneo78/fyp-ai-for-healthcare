Hello all. My name is Daniel I'm 23 and going to school in Bowling Green, Ohio. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, ADD, and depression. I've tried various medicines for my ADD and the last one I was on was Effexor XR, usually used to treat depression but can be used for adult ADD, I was on it for a year or two and kept increasing the dosage b/c I wasn't seeing enough results. The medicine dosage got too high and I had a break down during the summer of 05. To vent I would cut myself and eventually attempted suicide in a Kroger parking lot. I went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed medicines, but I've grown tired of using medicines; I had a seizure while on a drug for acne. I refused to take the medicines and have been struggling with killing myself every day. I don't really like going into public due to my social anxiety and tend to turn to computer games to escape reality. I drink more caffeine than is healthy, don't sleep at night, and have fluctuations in eating. I never think I am good at anything, I built a computer last night which kind of made me feel good about myself, but that's not enough. I've stopped going to class because I don't think I'm good enough and haven't told anyone. I'm pretty much a wreck right now and am in the process of going to the counseling center that my school offers. I don't know how much longer I can hold out before I try something else. I am struggling to even be happy around my friends, family and girl friend. They all know I think about it every day, but never say anything. It's probably because I hide my feelings and lie to them about it. I don't want to even keep going to school it feels so pointless. My girl friend wants to get married I don't even want to think about it. I don't want to get married and am too gutless to tell her. I have feelings of breaking up with her but once again I'm to scared and gutless to say anything. I hate myself.
