I am Mark, this is my first post on here. I am feeling really scared of myself at the moment, I have been depressed to some extent for as long as i can remember, and have had many hospital admissions in the past, but for the past few years life has been manageable, I have been in a relationship, not a very good relationship but one that helped me feel safe, i stopped overdosing and cutting, the relationship as i said had its downsides i am not sure love is the word to describe what we had but it was a strong feeling whatever it was, and now that we are no longer together i realize that whatever we had was stronger than anything i had before. i am so lonely and have very scary thoughts, you see my partner has moved back to his home country as he had no choice he was living here illegally, the days we were together before he left i started to have very disturbing thoughts, i even thought of killing him as it would be easier than living without him!!! that is very scary. now that he is gone all the old feelings i used to have about myself and the hatred i have for myself is showing again, he was my protector, my distraction i suppose. but now i don't have that i feel it is only a matter of time until i do some thing really stupid. i have not acted yet as i do not what to have a 'failed' attempt, i am not sure i want help, that is why i am looking here first maybe after this rant i will understand what is happening a bit more, maybe not. all i know at this point is i would rather not be alive, not sure i want to kill myself but i don't want to be alive, don't know if that makes sense
