Ok I have a couple of questions...I guess. 1st is I finally managed to make myself an appointment with a psychiatrist (it's not till May). Now I'm having second thoughts about it. I just pretty much want to go in for an evaluation (to see if there is a problem) and see if maybe there is a short term solution for the suicidal thoughts I've been having. I've got a summer job I'm leaving for in June and than I'm moving to another city after that. (So basically something till I'm stable with where I'm living and job). I assume I'm only going to be able to see 1 doctor, 1 time before than. So 2nd thoughts have been should I just wait to see someone when I actually get settled. Also if a psychiatrist is who I want to see (I've never been to anyone before for my mental health)...that's what the intake coordinator suggested. Also I was wondering if they could hospitalize you for suicidal thoughts without your permission? Ok now on to the suicidal thoughts questions (and just so people know I do not feel myself to be in any immediate or near immediate danger to myself). One main thing is does depression have to be present for suicidal thoughts/actions? I often find my mind turns more to thoughts of suicide and death when I feel relatively normal mood wise. And that when I have feel really depressed the thought of suicide rarely crosses my mind (but the pain is more severe). I guess that's really all I have. Sorry if the topic is inappropriate for this forum. I just wanted to ask...and maybe discuss with someone...but don't really feel that it's a problem for me right now. If someone wants to talk in PMs I wouldn't mind either.
