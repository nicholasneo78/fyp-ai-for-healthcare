Hi everyone. I am here because I am very depressed due to uncontrollable situations of extreme stress this year and a lifetime of stupid choices that have led me to where I am today: lonely and sad. I talked to my primary dr. and now have been taking Zoloft for almost 2 months. It seems to help some, I don't feel like I will panic to the point of losing control completely. And I am seeking help, I don't have a therapist yet, but I checked with my insurance and wrote some names down, now I have to pick up the phone and speak into the receiver and set an appointment. My plan is to do this on Monday. I like to be supportive of others, so although I do sound gloomy, I hope to meet others who are making progress and maybe be of help to you, too. I will post more later I feel the need to sleep. I have trouble with sleep and nightmares and eating, lately I have to force myself to eat, I have a weird aversion to food, I start to feel sick & queasy when I try to eat. But life in general makes me sick and queasy. I am alone for the Holidays which suits me just fine. I wish I could go to the "Island of misfit people" and stay there and never leave. For now that is the comfort and safety of my home, unless I go to work or need groceries. Later...
