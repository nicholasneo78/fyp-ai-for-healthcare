I've been neglecting you my wonderful little blog haven't I? I'm sorry... I didn't mean to. Last night Carmen was a giggle, and so was the Anakali. I'm glad I didn't go into the Blue Rock. Even in my drunken state I realized it was a bad idea. I'm glad Gem did her job (Go gem!) and I did mine by not going to the Blue Rock after, and taking her home with me so Life is good. ish. Yet again, I am surprised by lack of hangover, but I'm not complaining. The day I get a hangover will be the day cows start flying... hopefully... I shall be quiet now. I have hockey to go to. Tech to do. Violin to practice. Awakenings to happen. You get the idea.... Love you!!
