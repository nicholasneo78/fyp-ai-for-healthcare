I have such a strong urge to just pick my stuff and leave at the moment that it's not even funny. I really, really just want to grab a bus ticket and get out of here. I suppose there are a lot of reasons, but one in particular.

This is going to get a little creepy and it involves incest, so please don't read any further if you're just going to flame me. My brother has an attraction to me which really creeps me out. He's all the time running around the house naked, hitting on me, 'helping' me adjust my dresses so his hands can slide dangerously near my chest. It really, really disturbs me. My problem is that he asked me if it was all right if he hung around naked and stuff when I was drunk. I told him yes because I didn't have my mind about me. Now I can't think of how to tell him that it makes me uncomfortable and that I don't want him doing it anymore.

Along with that I just lost my best friend due to depression. I've been trapped in my house for two weeks and I haven't seen my mom, dad, brother, or sister for more than five minutes in this entire time.

I just want to run away from it all. I don't want to kill myself, but I do want to pack and go and just get away from this wretched town. Would it be such a bad thing to leave? I know it would be running from my problems, but maybe I could find easier problems to deal with somewhere else.
