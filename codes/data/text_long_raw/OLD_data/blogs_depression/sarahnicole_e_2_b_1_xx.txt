Hello everyone, I am new here. I am Sarah and in my early thirties. I live in Europe and found this forum today! I just want to share my thoughts and because I was afraid anyone would find out about my feelings I searched for a foreign forum. And found it! I have been struggling all my life but after a series of events (death of dear aunt and suicide attempt off parent) I found myself starting therapy almost 2 years ago. At first everything was fine and I was learning a lot about myself and how to make my life easier and how to love myself. i really was hopeful and thought my life would finally get happier and maybe I would even meet some one to share my life with.... After a year of therapy I started feeling worse about myself and developed an eating disorder and a few months ago I also started feeling more and more depressed. At first I denied everything and even threatened to quit therapy because I was convinced time would heal me....well I now know that healing is not that easy. over the past two weeks I have been to a psychiatrist who wants to start me on Prozac (because it shouldn't make me gain weight, she thinks this would be the best ad. for me) and earlier this week i went to see my usual psychotherapist who said I was severely depressed and she urged me to start taking the medication because of my state of mind. I might loose my job in the near future and with all this extra stress my thoughts have been very scary. I am starting to think more and more about death and for this reason my therapist started talking about hospitalization! Off course I don't want that so I agreed earlier today to start with the medication....I am so scared about the side effects and don't know what i will do if I gain weight. Also I don't think I want to life if I loose my job...I think that will push me over the edge. 
I hope I can find the energy to read more messages on this board and maybe get a good feeling about life again. Bye for now, Sarah
