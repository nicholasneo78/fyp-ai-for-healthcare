I just recently got a test back in one of my classes and saw that I totally failed it. Now I'm worried about this class and I can't afford to repeat anything, literally and figuratively. I'm older so I don't have the time to go screw around and repeat classes and I'm sick of school as it is. I hate the uphill battle, just barley hanging on. Why? I did great in high school with a 3.5 GPA. and I made straight A's a couple times in middle school. Other people breeze through school and it makes me angry that it's such a struggle for me just to get C's in college. I'm sick of this I want it all to end, and I still have a whole year after this semester. And even that's not a guarantee the way things are going. Just needed to rant.
