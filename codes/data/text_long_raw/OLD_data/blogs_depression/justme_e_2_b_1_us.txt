I've realized that I made a big mistake by starting this blog. It serves no purpose to put feelings out for public view, so I've deleted the entries from the last six months. I was going to explain some things, but thought better of it. I think a small part of my old self has awakened again. I'm a bit ashamed of all the whining I've done here. I'm embarrassed that I've sought out people in my life for emotional support when I should have dealt with things privately, on my own. When I lost my mind to grief, I forgot everything that I knew. As the old adage goes: you come into this world alone, you live alone, you die alone. You solve your problems alone, needs to be added. The intense pain of grief can warp your mind, impair your judgment and make you do foolish things that you will later regret. I'm sorry if I've upset anyone, but my intention was simply an attempt at self-help, not to change the world. I was simply searching for a way to try to deal with and escape from this pain. I've always appreciated the supportive comments left by people and I thought I had expressed that before. I never thought anyone had an expectation that I would contact them or would even really want me to contact them. I am after all, a stranger to those who have read my words. I was getting to the point where I was starting to  consider emailing some of the people who have posted comments, just to thank them, but now I think that it's better that I don't. This is the old, public version of me writing to day.  I've pushed most of the real, troubled me back down into a box for a little while. I've resolved only to let her out when I'm alone. In this blog, I did dwell on many of the same things again and again, but I was surprised that I could actually find some release by repeatedly talking about the same thing. I think this will be my last entry, so goodbye and good luck.
