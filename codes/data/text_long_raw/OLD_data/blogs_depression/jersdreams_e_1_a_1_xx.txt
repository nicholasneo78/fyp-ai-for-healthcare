I'm a guy...well still a teen but a guy, and the sad thing is I feel such like a girl. I'm not into the macho thing, but I cry all the time when I'm not around people, I feel like crap, I have swings where all of a sudden I just get very very angry at people All these things. I've never gone to a doctor out of fear of embarrassment and telling my parents what I feel. I hide it from them and try to hide it from others...but it usually doesn't work. Its been like this for a year now, but as of late it doesn't end, before there was some couple of day breaks in between, but now everyday I am depressed. I am sick of life...I want to end it, but the only thing that is stopping me is what happens if I do. I just can't get pass the action....what happens during it. There is almost a physical feeling surrounding me...I feel it. That is just how I feel. Hope that gives insight. Maybe itâ€™s the man in me to scared to go to a doctor.
