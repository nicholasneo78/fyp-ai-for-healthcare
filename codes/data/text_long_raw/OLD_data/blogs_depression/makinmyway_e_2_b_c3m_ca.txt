i have been on celexa for a month now ... at first it was great ... i was dizzy and drowsy but my moods were much better i had a tolerance that i never had before ... the bad part was i couldn't eat ... i'm over that now! .. lol ... i do however have the oddest sleep patterns, i fall asleep everyday around 4 for an hour ... but can't seem to get to sleep at night ... i wake up tired .... as for the end of this month i feel normal .... or maybe i'm just used to it ... the one thing that bothers me is i'm normally a emotional person ... and i fear that i've become numb ... i don't feel things the way i used to ... which is i guess the point of it ... i've experienced weight loss however ..... i'm grateful for what it has done for me ... i am able to see my situation clearly and think about myself now.
