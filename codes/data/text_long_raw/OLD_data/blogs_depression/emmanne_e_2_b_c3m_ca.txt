I take effexor and I have gained lots of weight. I have become so self conscious of my self. After buying all new clothes and trying to stay in staying I can't feel sexy anymore.  I love my boyfriend and he is great but I don't even feel 100% sexual with him just because I am not as fun as I use to be. 

I also have dreams that I can't tell if they are real or not. I will tell someone something thinking we had had a conversation I guess it was in my sleep. I sweat like crazy yes, it is gross but what to do?

Also I really need some advice on my boyfriend. He is great supportive but he says it's hard for him to and it takes a toll on him. How can he better handle this, not that he does not do a wonderful job now, but just new advice for his sake. He is not sick with anything and I tell you I get mood swings like crazy. I am not the same girl he met and I so want to be but I can't shake this and I am afraid that it will be here forever. I can't deal with it forever it burns me out.

Please Help

oh yes I also find it hard to have friends because they do not understand I want to go out but I don't and plus most of the time I don't have the energy.
