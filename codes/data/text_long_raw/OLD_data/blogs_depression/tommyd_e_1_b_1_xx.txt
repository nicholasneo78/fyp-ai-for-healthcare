I am new here today. I believe I have been suffering from depression since I was a late teen. I am now 42, run my own business and just started Prozac late December & seeing a psychologist in late Nov. I do not feel any better but it is a relief just knowing that you are doing something other than trying to ignore a definite but unexplainable problem. I suffer from severe anxiety, fall asleep fine but wake up at 2.00 am with my mind racing a million miles a minute, mostly about work. This anxiety and depression has definitely affected my relationship with my wife & kids. Most times when you're at work you want to be home & vice versa, really don't know what you want. I do not feel like talking to anyone & have cut off most of my good friends. I understand most men do not want to admit they have a problem until their wife leaves them and it's too late. I am happy that is not the case with me. I just hope the medication kicks in soon so I can see what it feels like to be normal if that is possible. Thanks for letting me ramble
