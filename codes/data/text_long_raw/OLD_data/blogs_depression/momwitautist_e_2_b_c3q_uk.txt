I was born with mom who has mild autism and in general i have hard times. Since i am her only daughter, i am trying to help her but don't know how? Can somebody suggest me on how can i help my mom to overcome the tantrums? She is a nice mother, she with my dad's help had raised me very well. Since she had did her best to raise me well, i want to do something for her and i want her to be able to socialize more and be outgoing person more. So please i am asking for help.
