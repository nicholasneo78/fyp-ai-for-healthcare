when i was really young my sister who is like 5 years older than me got me to constantly play these role playing games with her where she was the dominant one in the relationship it went on until i was in 6th grade i think i don't know and the thing is, I'm not repulsed by her or anything. i don't hate her. i didn't know at the time it was wrong but even though i do now ... i don't really know my feelings about it but i think it's one of the reasons I'm depressed. i haven't been able to tell anyone about it. not even my psychiatrist. i wish i could but every time i get close i close up and get really anxious i wish i could get this off my chest. i don't know if my mom knows or not. we don't talk about anything  and to add to this, i think i might be gay and i don't know if it was because of this or not it  it started when i was 12 but i didn't recognize it as homosexuality. I've only been with two girls while in middle school but that's it.  i think some guys are cute and all but i just get really uncomfortable. my psychiatrist thinks i have some repressed memory   but i don't know what to do about it. i always clog up whenever i want to tell someone something important  i have this fear that they wont care or will tell someone else. my family has a huge problem with that and I've known too many deceitful people to trust anyone  so if you have any ideas to what i should do please tell me
