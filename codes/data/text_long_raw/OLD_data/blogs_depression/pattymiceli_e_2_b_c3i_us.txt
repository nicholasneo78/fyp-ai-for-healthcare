I am new to this so please bear with me.  I don't even know where to begin.  With all of  
the tragedy going on in our gulf coast as well as the war, I feel I have no right to be  
unhappy but I am 24 / 7.

I am 37 years old and have made a complete mess of my life.  My parents were raised in  
Europe and came to the states in their 20's.  I have a younger brother who also has  
depression but it differs from my own.  When I look back at my childhood all I feel is  
pain and neglect and I can't recall any happy memories.  I don't believe that I was ever  
physically abused however, I do think that I was ignored and emotionally neglected.   
Perhaps that is why I manage to make a mess of my life every time things seem to be going  
well.  I'm married and have a 4 year old son.  From all outward appearances, my life comes  
across as perfect (although we all know there is no such thing).

I have been seeing psychiatrists and therapists since I was 17 and have tried to commit  
suicide on four separate occasions.  My mother suffers from depression and her mother did  
as well.  This is such a long and complicated story and I don't know how much I am allowed  
to write or if anyone is even interested since this is my first try in any type of chat  
room.  My interior pain lies so far deep that I don't sleep, hardly eat and feel miserable  
all the time.

I guess that is all I will say for now.
