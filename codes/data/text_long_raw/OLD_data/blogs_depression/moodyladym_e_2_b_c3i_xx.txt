i am 29 and a mother of three children ages 11, 6, and 2. i have been severely depressed for like my whole life even  when i was in kindergarten i was different i cried all day every day. i have been through so many what i consider to be stages in my depression from like 14 - 17 i suffered from eating disorders and i was a cutter as well then i started having these horrible panic attacks i have spent the good part of the last  10 years dealing with that i have tried many different medication prozac, paxil, buspar and have been on zoloft 50 mg for 2 months it has helped a little but not much i am still horrified to leave my home , scared to be alone , needless to say i have no social life. i just wonder if there really is any hope out there and would love someone to talk to that knows where i am coming from
