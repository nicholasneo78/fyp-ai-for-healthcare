Hello, I'm new here. I'm 36 and have had depression since the age of 9. I'm supposed to take Lexapro every day, but often I forget. Memory / concentration is poor, one of the areas of the brain that depression screws with, the others being sleep, appetite, and libido.

Here's my thing ... I'm so gosh darn afraid to do anything! It's hard at times to even face my job, I call in sick and stay in pajamas all day. I do get out of bed, but I won't bathe or brush teeth. Isn't that gross! I did this on Monday and Tuesday this week.

I'm in school at night, it's a tele course class in geology. Last Friday we had an exam, and I didn't show up for it because I didn't do any reading for it. Now it's almost Wednesday, and I still haven't touched the reading. We can make up the exam no later than 1 week after the exam date, so I have two days to cover several chapters. Thing is, I'm SCARED CRAPLESS to even start!!! It's like I've got "freeze - itis" and I can't seem to study! I've been doing other things, like cleaning and laundry and doing Immigration research (trying to bring my Egyptian fiance here to the States), but haven't touched the geology, even though that's been #1 on my mind for two weeks. Even this past weekend, I had no plans (as usual!) and didn't crack open even one page.

I fear failure, and it's so hard to "let go and let God". I know in my head to give this fear to God, but I don't really know what that specifically means. In the meantime, I'm miserable and failing my geology class. Already I dropped the music class (originally I had two), since I was failing that royally.

Can anyone relate? How do any of you summon up the courage to face your fears?
