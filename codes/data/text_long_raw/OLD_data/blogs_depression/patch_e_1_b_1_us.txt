I will be on the road in less than 72 hours. The last month has taken a serious toll on me physically, cognitively, emotionally, and spiritually. Things have suddenly gotten so crazy. Nothing looks even remotely familiar to me (Aggers, 2002). I have held My Sweetie with tears in my eyes, hoping her to buoy my hope for the future. I have been overwhelmed by the enormity of change and possibility, fallen to my knees, bowed my head beneath our roof, and prayed in earnest that it will not be the last. I have wrestled with the stranglehold of others' denial, silently observing time crush their last defense as the flurry of last-minute demands, requests, and desires are left unfulfilled. I have ended my beloved employment, said goodbye to supervisors and peers, returned keys, cleaned out my desk, and stood at the door of my empty office with the first true inkling of the magnitude of what has become the most difficult life transition I have yet faced.
