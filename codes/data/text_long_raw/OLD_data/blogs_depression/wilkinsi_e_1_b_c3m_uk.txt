having just cheated on a girl i've known for over 3 years, i have felt not only depressed, but also physically sick from the moment i got on the train home at the weekend. i am incapable of vomiting because i have a stomach ulcer from 4 years ago as a result of depression at a previous job. i have repeatedly apologized profusely to her, and today was told that she would not be able to see me before she leaves to go back abroad. i can only hope at this stage that she will contact me when she returns to the uk. the worst part is that i don't seem to have a reason for going with the other girl.
