I'm curious to know how you raise children when you have major depression with bipolar. I feel extremely guilty that I am having a hard time being a mom. I have no energy and I am completely overwhelmed with every little task it takes to raise these kids. 
My husband seems to be running out of patience with me ...... and I have really only been battling this recent episode of major depression for 3 months.
Sometimes I feel like we all would be better off with me out of the picture ... whatever that takes .... because I am sick of the guilt !!! I also am suffering from 4 herniated discs in my back with sciatica down both legs. So doing things just suck. My husband made the comment today that we should sign me up for AARP ... at least we could get some good benefits. I'm 35. Plus these medications make me feel like shit!
I really don't want to have to take care of anyone right now. God I'm selfish!!

Down in the dumps and full of anxiety,
