 Did I put more into this than I should? Are my emotions getting the better half of me? Do you feel anything close as the way I do? Are you pulling away now? These are the questions that keep running around in my head. As the time grows closer for you to leave I am seeing you less and less. I think its four more days I have left with you. And then your gone not close enough for me to have and hold. I telling myself that I shouldn't be feeling this way. But, I can't help how I feel I guess. I think that's it, you took me off guard. I wasn't ready to meet someone like you. I'm truly glad that I did and I wouldn't change that for anything. Please know that I will be ok. That I will look on this as something pleasant in my life...and I need nice things in my life right now. I know I'm not losing you. We will still talk and see each other from time to time. I just wish it was more....
