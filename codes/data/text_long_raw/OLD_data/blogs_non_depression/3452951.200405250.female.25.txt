 Why is it when something negative comes my way I run and hide? I push away all the people that I truly care about  and I  crawl in to a dark closet with in my mind and slowly shut down. I still to this day don't know how to take rejection when all my life its all I had you would think id be used to it by now, I was never good enough for my mother all the guys I dated treated me like shit  what did I do to deserve this? All I ever wanted was to be loved unconditionally, now I see my self unable to give the love that is needed to my beautiful daughters, why cant my daughters love be good enough for me? Why do I need the love and approval of a man to  fulfill me ?? I just don't understand  where I went wrong in my life!
