 Hey, my name is Chloe and I am 13 years old. I am 5 foot 6 inches, I have dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, and I weigh ___ pounds. I am in the 6th grade for 16 1/2 more days and then I'm going to a private school. The new school is my choice and I can't wait to go. Not only will I make a new beginning, but I will get away from all the people that I have a bed reputation with. This summer, I'm babystiing and making 550 dollars. Shopping!!! Anyways, my few true friends that I have now are Sarah, Rachel, Andrea, Tess, Kali, and that is about it. I am currently single because I just broke up with my old boyfriend. I broke up w/ him because he was not talking about appropriate things and it wasn't working out. Right now I am in a fight with two people; Madison and Missy. Missy is always going to hate me and Madison....well, I can't trust her at all. Anyways, it's 3:13 right now and I just got home from a long day at school. I am really bored. Uggh. Well, I guess I'll see you later. Love Always, Chloe
