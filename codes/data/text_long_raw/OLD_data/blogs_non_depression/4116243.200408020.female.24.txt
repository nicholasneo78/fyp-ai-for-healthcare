 And so begins the life of my blog, a true understanding of what it is to be bloggish. Okay, so maybe I made that word up. I thought I would begin my disadvantageous interest in blogging for the first time. I have read many and participated in none. Creating this posting off of pure allurement of the idea has been quite interesting and (hopefully) stays that way. Today I create, and juxtapose the ideas of life and wonderment of a being, which whom, has a slightly higher interest in being more than most. With this, I bid you farewell until next time, for now I have work to do.
