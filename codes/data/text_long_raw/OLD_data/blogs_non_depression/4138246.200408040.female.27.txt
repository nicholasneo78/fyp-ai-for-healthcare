 Hey there....Sherrie here. Fancy meeting you. Glad you could stop in!      Let me introduce myself.... My name is Sherrie, I am 27 years old, I live in Kentucky, work for a short-line  railroad company, married to a wonderful husband (Lauren), have no children (yet) and I love to crochet!      My husband also works for a railroad related industry that manufactures railroad crossties. He enjoys his job as much as I do, which is a lot! We do not have any children, but are in the process of becoming foster and adoptive parents for this state and are anxiously awaiting the approval letter and arrival of our first child. I can imagine that my crocheting time will decrease even more when this happens! LOL      Now, enough about me, and on to the topic at hand - crochet!      I have alot of different projects started, from plastic canvas, to thread and yarn crochet. My most favored project is the 63 squares combine to make an afghan. I have not been working on this project all that long, but I have finished the first 5 squares, and this, I am happy about! I am on the 6th one now, and it isn't as fun. It is wanting to roll up like a paper towel tube and I have to fight with it to make it do what I want it to do! LOL      I will try to post some pictures of my squares and this project as soon as I can. I will close for now, and crochet some more....until next time - happy crocheting to you!
