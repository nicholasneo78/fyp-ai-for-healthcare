 Well, apparently, I'm back.       Went to see Grandad in hostpital, he's in the same bit of the same hospital as mum was (cancer wards at Mount Vernon). He seems alright. Yay!       Went to M ;S to get some shopping for Nan. Jenny got 2 hair product things (mousse + spray I believe), so I was allocated Â£2 by Paul. Now in possession of 2.25 litres of  Blackthorn . Definately got the better deal there, methinks. :D   After, visiting grandad, went to  Wagamama's . Good shit. Noodles and suchlike. Nummyness.
