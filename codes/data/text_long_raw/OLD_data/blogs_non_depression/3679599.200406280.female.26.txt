 I am currently reading a book called "Prayer Walking" The concept is to strengthen you body as well as your soul. Hmmm...I think I am going to give this book a try. I do need to prayer more and get a stronger prayer life, and I do need to lose some weight. But in order to do this, I will have to get up early and actually get out there and walk. I think, once I am done with the book, I will actually get started. I will have to let you know how it goes.  Church yesterday was awesome! We had a powerful move of God and a total refreshing swept through the church. It was amazing! During last nights service, I got all the girls in the youth group up at the front dancing and jumping. It was such a great time in the Lord. Those girls are so special and God is doing great things in their lives.
