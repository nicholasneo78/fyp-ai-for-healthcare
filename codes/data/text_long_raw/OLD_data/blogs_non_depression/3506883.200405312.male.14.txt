 Today is Memorial day. If you see a veteran tell them thanks. Because if you think about it, withought them we would probably be under a rule of another country. And we wouldnt have the freedom that we take for granted in the U.S. So please if yous ee a veteran tell them thanks for all that they have done. It will make their day a little brighter.
