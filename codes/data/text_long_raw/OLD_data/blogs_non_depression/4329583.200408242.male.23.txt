 A kindergarten teacher gave her class a "show and tell" assignment. Each student was instructed to bring in an object to share with the class that represented their religion.  The first student got up in front of the class and said, "My name is Benjamin and I am Jewish. This is a Star of David."  The second student got up in front of the class and said, "My name is Mary. I'm Catholic, and this is a Rosary."  The third student got up in front of the class and said, "My name is Tommy. I am a Baptist, and this is a casserole."
