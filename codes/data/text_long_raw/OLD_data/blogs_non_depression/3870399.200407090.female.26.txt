 Today Jay and I went and looked at a few houses.  The one I liked the most was temporarily taken off the market, but anyway.  We found 2 more that had potential in them.  In the mean time we are still on the look out for the right house.  I am now free of paying off my car because today I made the final payment.  YEAH!!! YEAH!! YEAH!! It is about time, 5 years seems to long.  Anyway, it is raining right now and I am on the last chapter of my book.  Can't wait to finish it to start on my other 2.  Until the next post.
