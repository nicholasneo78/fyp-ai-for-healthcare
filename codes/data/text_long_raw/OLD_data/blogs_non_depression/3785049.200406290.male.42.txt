 Watching the end of the Today show...  Monitoring my work email, but not aggressively working today.  I've pretty much checked out for the July 4th holiday.  I have a few things to do this week, but not a whole lot.  I could find lots of work to do, but without them having deadlines, I'm not too motivated.  Yesterday, the tile installers were supposed to come put in new flooring in my bathrooms.  They didn't show up.  They are supposed to be here today, but it's almost 10:00 am and they are still not here.  I'll give them till 10:15 before I call the company and see where they are.  I think they had to swing by Home Depot to pick up the supplies first, so I'll give them a little leeway.  I'm headed to the Pacific Northwest on Thursday night for some vacation.  Four nights in Seattle, then 3 in Vancouver, then 1 back in Seattle before flying back home to Dallas.  I'll spend some time in the city, but plan on getting out into the surrounding country as much as I can too.  I intend on exploring they Olympic peninsula, Mt. Ranier area, Victoria, and a few other places.  Plus a little city nightlife to divert my attention some.  OK, the tilers arrived just now...  so I'll keep my fingers crossed.
