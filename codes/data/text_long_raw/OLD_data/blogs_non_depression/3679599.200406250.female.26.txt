 Well, I am starting a blog for the first time. I guess I will share a little about myself.   I am 27 years old. Married 3 years (August 18) to a wonderful man of God. He is a minister with the ALJC and we are the youth pastors at our church.  Currently I work for an Insurance company. I am the Marketing Assistant. I love where I work. The people are great!  My husband is starting his own interior business ding remodeling and painting.
