 Ok...so I'm slowly getting this whole HTML crap. I've even got some links now. Hopefully I can figure out how to futher fancify my blog with some pics n' flashy stuff.  And by "figure out" I mean ask Beth. Frick! It's 2am and it's a work nite. I guess I'll hurl myself down the stairs so I don't have to go in tomorrow. Yea!!! No work!!!
