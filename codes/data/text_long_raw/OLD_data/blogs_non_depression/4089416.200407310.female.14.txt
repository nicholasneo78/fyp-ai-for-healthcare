 Isn't it strange how well life is going perfect yuo never take time to thank God for everything that you have, but then the second you lose something you either blame it on God or beg him to give it back, or when you do have something you want u go to God and ask him to do it all for you. Isn't it strange how when u have alot of friends to talk to you dont care about the people who mean most to you, but then when you lose all your friends you try and turn back to the ones who care about you even though you ignored them and treated them like jerks. Isn't it strange that the things you seem to hate most in life are the things that will help your life, like doing math homework, or getting grounded for failing a science test that u didnt study for to begin with. Isn't it strange how sometimes your worst enemie becomes your best friend, and your best friends sometimes become your enemies. Isn't it strange how when someones so happy with the thing they have you start to get jealous insted of being happy for them, then start to want something just because someone else has it. Isn't this just all so strange?
