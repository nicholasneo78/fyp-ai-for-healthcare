 Its fun to the max, this whole writing on the computer thing. This way I don't have to freak out about my messy handwriting! Seeing as this is my first post, I am not going to take the time to voice opinions, share thoughts, examine beliefs, view ideas, yeah, you get the picture? The reason for that is because I am, well, first of all tired and second, I am...well, tired! There you go...I am just about having fun in the Lord and not having this whole pious, reverent aura about me, all the time. My God is one of crazy...in a sense. Hey now! Not crazy like...Terminator/Governor crazy, but a sense of him being just crazy for us and us being wild for him!    Shoot, I just voiced an opinion...
