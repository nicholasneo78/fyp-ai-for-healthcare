 OMG! Today was like so incredibly great! Abie came home with me from school to go and see Awkward Romance performs. (They are like the greatest Christian band, ever! ROCK ON!) Well all I have to say about this afternoon before church is that I’m gonna need to start wearing chapstick like all the time now . . . ::naughty grins:: I don’t like chapstick, but I think it’s worth it . . . Did I mention that I love Abie, yet? No? Well I did now. The concert was great and all, but I think her and me would have had a better time, if we had stayed home instead . . . oh well . . .
