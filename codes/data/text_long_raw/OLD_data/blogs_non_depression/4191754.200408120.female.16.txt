 Lolz... Marcus got a B3 for his 'O' levels MT. So happy for him. Tols him this Sat can go his home, he sounded so happy. Don't know he ask me go his home for what. but i think i can trust him. No, i believe i can trust him. But, if he let me down, i don't think i will ever trust anyone again. Scared already.  Got back my bio paper yesterday. I failed by one mark!!! Haiz... i aiming for bio-medical course. my bio cannot go down!!! Must work harder than ever.  Tired. Don't want to write anymore. End here then. Adios...
