 1st blog ever. I'm sure that by tomorrow I'll forget I even started this whole blog thing... Maybe not tho'.  We'll see.    Oh... what to talk about???  Umm... I dumped my boyfriend this weekend.  Now I have to move all my shit, including a piano, couch, entertainment center, etc., out of his house.  That sucks.  He's a cool guy, but unfortunately, cannot be honest.  He has a serious lying problem.  I have given him  plenty  of chances and this weekend was the last straw.  Hopefully this will be a wake up call and he won't fuck up future relationships the same way.  Good luck to him.   Now I am at work.  I am a Customer Relations rep for a utility company.  Everyone that calls hates me.  Makes for a long day.   I had a horrible dream last night that the world was ending due to global warming and I had no choice but to die a slow and painful death.  Thank you "Day After Tomorrow" previews!  It was a great way to start a great day. :)    The upside is that today is TUESDAY!!!  Only 3 and a 1/2 more shitty days left 'til the weekend. YAY!!!!!  Ta ta.
