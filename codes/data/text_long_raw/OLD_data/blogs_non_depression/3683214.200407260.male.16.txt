 Whoa! I really had no idea that college would be this difficult. I mean, maybe I'm still in the point of being culture shocked! Highschool is  way  different from college I tell you. Just don't know why it had to be very difficult you know. Anyway, that's how life works...never made it easy for anyone does it?
