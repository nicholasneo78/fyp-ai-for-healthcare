 Okay, so I just spent $50.00 bucks on a optical mouse.  It was either that or spend the money on food or shoes.  The new pet is a Logitech MX510 optical mouse, it is a cool maroon color and if you want to buy into the sales pitch each color is unique with no two the same.  The performance spec's are what cinched the deal for me..i did not even know that they had performance specs.  I got 5.8 megapixel per second image processing, 800 DPI resolution, and the solar flare reductor units are top of the line from NASA.  So technically with all this going for me, my online gaming experience should now vastly improve as I fight for world domination with 13 year olds (yeah right).  The one, for real thing is I did find a article about the mouse in Maximum PC magazine.  It got thier trademark (kick ass award).  That has to be worth $50.00 bucks.
