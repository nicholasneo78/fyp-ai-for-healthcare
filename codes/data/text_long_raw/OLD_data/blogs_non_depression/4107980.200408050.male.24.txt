 If you live in Canada you've probably heard that a Wal-Mart in Quebec has unionized, I won't get into the details or anything, I'll just say that while I have no real desire to have my store unionized I am hoping that this will scare the hirer ups and maybe start paying their employees a decent salary, I mean it's pretty sad when your full timers don't make enough to live on their own.
