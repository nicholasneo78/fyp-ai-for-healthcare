 Loneliness dominates you. You can hide it well, but it's there, and your friends can see it. You constantly feel alone, and need to do things to fill your time. You're afraid to tell people this, but sooner or later it gets out in a bad way, and you think you screwed up everything. And when you are in love is when you are sad the most.     urlLink   What Emotion Dominates you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    she came over today. i realized i missed spending afternoons with her. i guess its because i lost her for a while. maybe i needed that.  i have a motto:  paranoid bitches should go to hell.  because when you are, too many things go on in your mind. unnecessary stuff.   i am one of those bitches. ive been ignored. im being paranoid about it. its time to go to hell.
