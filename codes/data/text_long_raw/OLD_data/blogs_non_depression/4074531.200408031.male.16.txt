 In the past few days my life has changed so much. First i stayed at my friend Pauls house and by the time i left i had a GF. The story goes: I had been begging her to go out with me, she finally agreed to go out with me. I was so happy, and as it turns out i was her first kiss. It was great. She is the greatest thing to happen to me in a while. She is beautiful and i don't think she believes it. But she is. She has surprised me so much since i have known her. When i first met her my thought was "Man she is beautiful" I also thought "I am going to get her if its the last thing i do". I knew i had to have her. And now we are going out and her mom doesn't know! Not that we think she would get mad though i am sure she would, but we want to give it time. I want to be able to stay there a few times before i am not allowed to. I am sure that it might backfire at us but its a danger i am willing to conquer when it comes. Well its been 4 days since i asked her out, and i think it is going great. I got to spend time with her while i was there, and we had quite a bit of fun. But that is our business. She really did surprise me. She really is a great kisser, she can always get me going. I haven't told her that, but everytime she kisses me, i get a hard on. I guess she will know now! Well i am going to end this message here, thanx for taking the time to read this. I will sign out here. CASPER
