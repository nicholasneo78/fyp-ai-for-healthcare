 Hello!  This is my first post on blogspot and the first day of school. My language arts teacher told us about blogspot and how we all might make one. So I decided to go ahead and get use to it.  I never liked the first day of school because everything is messed up. I didn't even know what bus I was suppose to get on. This morning they told me something completly different than what I was told this afternoon. Most of my teachers are nice, which is a good thing of course.  I finally met my neighbor today! She's a junior and I've already met her brothers. They're all really nice. But now I dont have to ride the bus alone, so, it's all good!  I can't wait until FCA (fellowship of christian athletes) starts again. It's always an amazing experience and it's awesome because you're worshipping in school!  I will try to remember to post on this everyday. I will post some artwork once i find out how.
