 Hey, I feel like its been awhile, when in all relativety, my mind is always thinking and it feels like awhile, because things come and go in my head, and by the time, i get to this very "subject" of this post, I have been through many other subjects as well.  First off,   to get it off my mind, I just saw the movie "little black book" and ending said something like, life happens most, when you are planning for something that is approaching. So stop planning and live your life now. That totally goes against my life, because I have always been the planner, because then I think that I get what I want. But what if I didnt plan, and got what I needed the most, and secretly wanted the most too. But then if you dont plan at all, you could be a loser who doesnt do anything. Conflicting thoughts. I have always told myself not to plan so much, its just that it comes so naturally to me, to plan for college, plan why someone likes me, plan how i mangage my friends, money...everything. Maybe I will start by unplanning some of those things..and letting them come to me. One small thing at a time. I suppose.   we;ll talk soon. Caitlyn
