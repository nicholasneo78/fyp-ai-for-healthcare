 It's strange how one can wake up in a morning feeling that the day is going to be great, only to find that as each minute ticks, things slowly seem to get worse.  Today is one of those days.  Worse than just the average Monday feeling, I haven't felt any good until just now when I started to think about the days events.  I guess when you reach a rock bottom, the only way is up, so I'm trying to think positive that come tomorrow things will all fit into perspective.   Still not heard anything from Morrisons, although they should have received my letter last Friday.  Not really sure what sort of response I'll get but it has to be better than the response I got from Customer Services last week.  We'll see how it goes.   Spoke to Rob, but felt too miserable to say much.  Looks like an early night for me.
