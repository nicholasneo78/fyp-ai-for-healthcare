 France and the Allies celebrated last week end one of the most fantastic military operations ever made in the world. Never so much depended on so few courageous soldiers wo sacrified to free a continent they didn't know. I'm 26 and i knom i'm living in a free land thanks to brave young men who fought for what they believe to be right. I will always love this America but i can help thinking that today America is on the wrong way. America's grief is justified, America is right to launch attacks against a faceless ennemy who wants to burn the whole world but this fight can be boiled down to a fight between evil and good, to a crusade against barbarians, it will be dangerous and counterproductive. Europe knows how complex is the world, europe knows how high is the price of blood and Europe doesn't want to be part of the wrong war. The United States are our closest friends and friends don't have to agree on everything. On the contrary, i will be happy if my friends tell me that i'm about to make a huge mistakes, that i act like a fool. I will be very thankful and i will accept this lend hand... because i don't want to stumble and fall in the Depths
