 My cat, Dolemite, who passed away about a month ago was actually just away and came back. I still had Gunther and they seemed to get along ok. The odd thing was that I had given Dolemite some hot sauce in a playful manner and he had thrown it up on my rug. I don't know what the hot sauce means, but I do know that seeing Dolemite means I still miss him.
