 Well... if anybody read my xanga then you would know that yesterday wasn't the best of days. But oh well, nothing I can do at this point. My brudder comes home tomorrow from Germany, I'm VERY excited about that. Five weeks is a long time to go without seeing your brudder when you haven't gone more than like 1 week without seeing him prior to that. Ryan (my boyfriend) comes home Friday. I was pleasantly surprised when I found that out, we thought he was getting home Sunday. I'm not gunna be able to talk to him until Friday cause now he's on a cruise ship, unless he has service in Norway or where ever it is that he's going. I have an audition at the Legion Theatre in Cartersville this Saturday, I might not even go... but we'll see. I'm supposed to go help at "Music Man" Friday night in downtown Acworth, we'll see if I can make it. Well... have a good day everyone!  urlLink
