 Wow..I really missed posting..although as you can see..I have only about less than three posts yet..anyway..I've got loads to tell you since my long absence..  I feel good about our Midterm Examination in Math 17 or the so-called Departmental Exam..Yup..I feel good about it..and I think I have 67% of passing? I really need to pass it though..I've already failed two consecutive long exams..both of which is 80 pts and has a 10% equivalence in our grade..  But anyway..the good news about it all is that I passed our Long Exam in Philosophy 1..and I'm happy about it! 'Coz I never really got the chance to review that..and then I passed..  Hey..visit our section's site during highschool..I made it..It's not much..but hey..we've got a site!
