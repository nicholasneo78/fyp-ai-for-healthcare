 My first blog! I know its kinda cheesy after other people have already had one but...what the hell. It gives me something to do other then gay msn. Anyway, It was Colour Night tonight. It was...Colour Night. Nothing Special. Tyson won for the SRC President and I brought home Top Male Jr. in track,and not a single academic award...as usual. After that, Mitch, Scott, Kendra and Me went cruisin around for abit and went to the FT. It was fun. It was better then doing homework at an old ladies house... Anyway, Time for bed...Later
