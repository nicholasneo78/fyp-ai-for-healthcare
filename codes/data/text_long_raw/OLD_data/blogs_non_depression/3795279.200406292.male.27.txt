 I've been patient about the whole idea of waiting for paperwork, waiting for the schools to mail a piece of paper, but now I am ready to get this over and done with. I have packed up most of my things and I have tried to make arrangements to get things settled and I'm being held up by this piece of paper that says "you'll be here" I knew for sure that I'd have the arrete by now, but it seems that I've been merely living in a dream. Oh well for now i guess I'll just continue going day by day, waiting patiently..
