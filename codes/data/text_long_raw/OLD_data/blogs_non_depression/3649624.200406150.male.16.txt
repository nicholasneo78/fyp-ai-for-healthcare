 I hate driving.  Yesterday I was in an accident which ruined my insurance.  I had already been in an accident where I filpped my car on a curve and toatled my 01 Civic, now I just totalted some poor girls Nissan.  Fuck!  I've decided to not drive for a while and get my shit straight, take a class.  I'm also pissed off because now I can't go see Dashboard Confessional in Duluth, GA on the 19th.  Oh well, we all know that God works in mysterious and often weird ways.  Maybe I'll learn something valueable in my class....or a girl...that would be nice.  A girl that can't drive like me.  The girl I hit was kinda hot...so I was trying to like "comfort" her...haha.  Oh yeah, another shitty detail was that she was the police's daughter...there should be a law against that.  Yes...Law enforcement personel's kids should not be allowed to drive.  Oh who am I kidding...I just fucked up....again.  I'll take it like a man and get another job.  Wreck + Wreck = More Jobs!
