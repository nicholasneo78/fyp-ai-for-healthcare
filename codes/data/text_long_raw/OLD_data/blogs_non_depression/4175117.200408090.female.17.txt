 So today is my moms  49th birthday. We went out for dinner to Timbers, it was Really good!! Its hard to believe its already her birthday. It seems like this summer is going by so fast. Sometimes, well a lot of the time, it scares me how fast time goes. I guess you just have to live every minute to the fullest...which is hard sometimes. Oh well, thats life.  I'm not in the mood to dwell on serious topics like this right now..so i'll be moving on to something a bit happier.  I'm going to a cottage tomorrow with a whole bunch of my friends. Its in Grand Bend, right on the main strip. I hope its fun. It will be...we always have fun together. I dunno though, for some reason im not really looking forward to it. Maybe its because I just started to like this guy Matt, and I dont want to leave and not be able to talk to him. I know its only for a few days, but im in that "just srarting to like someone" phase, and i like talking to him as much as possible. Oh well, the week will go by really fast, and Ill be back here, and able to talk to him as much as i want. Well, its been a pretty boring day...not much to talk about.  So  i think ill end this one here. Michele...
