 I am learning to listen to God's voice. Sometimes he speaks in a voice so small, I have to stop what I am doing just to listen. Like this morning, I had this feeling to pray for my husband. I had to stop what I was doing and pray. I prayed until the feeling left. I don't know if he was in danger or not, but God lead me to pray for him right then and there. Sometimes I wonder what would happen if I no longer listened to His voice. I don't think I am going to take that chance to find out.  I watched Jurassic Park 3 last night. I know, I am one of those people that actually like the movies. I really enjoyed number 3. It was a little different from the others. More action packed. My husband called me in the middle of it and told me I should be studying my insurance books instead of watching a movie. Well, he is right, but I finished the movie anyway.   My husband is working out of town this week.
