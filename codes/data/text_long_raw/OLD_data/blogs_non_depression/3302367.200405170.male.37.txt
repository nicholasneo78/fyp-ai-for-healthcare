 Today I got my Orange belt in Choi Kwang Do. The last "light" colored belt before Green which goes into the darker colored belts. I took the pictures tonight of the belt ceremony using my wife's Fuji S2. Sharp camera! Since I am an asst instructor I am now teting every month. I have my patterns down through Green belt, and plan on learning Blue and Purple patterns this week. :)  This weekend I did my first "non-official" videography event - a "reception" party for a couple that was married in Hawaii several months ago. Luckily it did not rain since it was an outside event. :) I took about 2 hours of film. I would think that a wedding would have actually been easier since there are actual "events" that you have to capture. This was basically just a party and therefore I became more the voyeur than the observer like normal weddings in that I had to walk around taping interesting converstaions. Luckily the bride & groom both have very outgoing personalities as do most of their close friends. My wife was the photographer (http://oneclickawayphoto.com) so in some cases I followed her around. But as the night wore on and the drinks became more potent I was able to pull out some interesting stories from some of the key attendees. Though I was really wanting Grandma to participate but she did not like the idea of being taped. Must be a generational thing. :)  Have you ever had a mental image of someone you worked with over long distances, but then when you actually met them or saw their picture realized your image was WAY off base? Had that happen today. Man - talk about being wrong. :)   Anyway - I'm off to play XBox. Later!
