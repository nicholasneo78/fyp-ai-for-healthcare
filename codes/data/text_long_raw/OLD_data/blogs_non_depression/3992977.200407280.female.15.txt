 One of my favorite animals is a dog. I like dogs because they are very playful and energetic. You can dogs real easy to me. You can treat a dog almost like a person. My favorite wild animal is  cheetahs. They are the fastest four leg animal on earth. But I wouldn't want to Have one of those for a house pet. This animal looks so lovable and you just got to have one. This animal is a tiger not just any tiger a white tiger. I really won't one of those. This is one animal I wouldn't won't to have this animal is a   MONKEY !
