 Well I have been working on this damn thing for the last four months straight, no days off not even weekends, and the end is rapidly approaching.  Friday the 2nd I get to defend this damn thing.  Though my advisor keeps reassuring me I have nothing to worry about, I cant help but shake the feeling that something bad might happen.  Nothing would suck more than spending 3 years busting your ass in a lab, and then not get your masters (or more years and PhD, but thats not the case here). Maybe its just stress.  It may be the fact that I still haven't found a job yet.  Whatever it is, I can not wait to get this over with on Friday, spend the evening with friends, and then start planning for the rest of my life.
