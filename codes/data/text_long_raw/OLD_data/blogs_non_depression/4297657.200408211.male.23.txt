 Ahh, the first post.  The beginning of an era of new thought, revelation and inspiration.  What great new thoughts are lurking in the underbrush of our minds, seeking to be found, dancing before us like snow in the wind?  Or we'll just post in on any old stuff that catches our fancy.  Welcome to my blog, I hope you enjoy it.  I am going to try and post at least a couple of times a week, try to stir some creative juices or just start some fights.   Hope you guys get out and put in!!  Josh
