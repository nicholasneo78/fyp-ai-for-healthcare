 I've been having trouble sleeping.  Well, not really.  I can sleep allright but I have these Godawful dreams that wake me up.  They aren't even the scary kind that are at least interesting to think about the next day. Like "What the hell did I eat last night that made me dream about long legged owls wearing blue jeans chasing me through my 1st grade classroom while screaming shutup" No, I've been dreaming about work.  Usually, I have a row of figures from one construction bid and I'm trying to compare them to a 2nd bid.  How freaking boring is that!  But it creates a really restless sleep.  Then at 4AM, I am wide awake.  I feel so AWAKE!  More awake then I've ever felt in my entire life.  I could read a book on the "Philosophy of Physics" and still be wide awake.  I know because I tried.  Then at about 5am I drift off to sleep only to be awakened 2 hours later by the alarm.  I awaken feeling so groggy, almost hung over like.  And now it is 11am and I am so tired.  I ...just ....want ....to ....take ....a ...nap.
