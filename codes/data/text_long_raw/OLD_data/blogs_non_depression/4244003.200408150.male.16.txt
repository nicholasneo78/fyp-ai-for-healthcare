 i leave for the Youth leadership conference  at camp pendleton tomorrow. my dad is driving me up there cuz  i have to attend mt SAT prep course until 12:30. i dont really want to go to the YLC i looked at the website and it looks really boring. hey at least its only for 4 days. i cant tell that this is just the beginning of an extremely strenuous year...i mean with the SAT prep, the AP classes, RO, and college stuff. im already getting stressed.  Wow this a really boring post. when i get back ill make sure to put up more hott and spicy topics.
