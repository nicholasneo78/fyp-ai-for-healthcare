Should I tell my boyfriend that I’m having suicidal thoughts? If so, how?
I posted here earlier asking if I should tell my therapist I’m having suicidal thoughts. I’m going to do that at our next appointment.

My question now is about telling my boyfriend. He knows I have depression and anxiety. I don’t want him to worry more than he already does. At the same time, though, I might need the extra support.

He probably already knows anyway....

What should I do and how should I do it? I know I can get through this. I’ve done it before, so I really don’t want him to worry. Any thoughts?
