I'm 20 years old today
The one thing I wanted for my birthday would've been a relationship. I feel so lonely all the damn time, and the one girl who I admitted my feelings to AND apparently likes me back is already dating someone else. 

My grades are dropping, I'm losing sleep, and I distract myself by playing video games in my dorm room all day like the useless loser I am.

And lucky me gets to relive all of this on Valentines Day tomorrow.

So here I am, 20 years old, no longer a teenager, but still a fucking child.

I'm not sure I even want to make it to 21.
