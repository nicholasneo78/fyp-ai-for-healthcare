I am very new to this forum so if I mess up on some of this edit stuff, I'm sorry. I am 29 years old, I have 4 children that which includes 9 year old twins. I had my last child in 2002. I have had depression ever since. It never went away. I also got married. My life changed completely. People don't even know who I am anymore. The bad thing is I don't even know who I am anymore. I feel like I am living for everyone else. I ask for nothing and expect nothing. I used to set such high standards for myself, I have a diploma and a 2 - year college degree. It means nothing to me now. I have not been able to work in 4 years and I am a person who went to work at 16. MY body is so weak now I take all this medicine and still no sleep. any thoughts will be helpful.
