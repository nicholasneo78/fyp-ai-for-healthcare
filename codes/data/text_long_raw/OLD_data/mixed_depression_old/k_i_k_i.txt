Im ready to leave my therapist?
I have 14 months in psychotherapy and 11 months with SNRI for dysthymia.

I feel strong enough to face myself, I have not felt depressed for a long time, even some mornings I feel motivated or even happy to wake up ... but I am scared because I know that hard times will be delayed or even more, I'm afraid if something big sink me again in suicidal toughts.
