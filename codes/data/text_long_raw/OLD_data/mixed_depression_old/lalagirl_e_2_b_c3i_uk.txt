I have just joined up because recently things have become a little too hard to cope with alone. I have suffered with depression for as long as i can remember really. but it's hard to find people who I can talk to. I always end up feeling like a burden, i know my friends just want me to be my happy party girl self, not the unhappy honest self. so I tend to keep quiet. Would love to have people to talk to about how i feel. I also have two little boys who I have to keep a happy face on for. find it hard to keep it up.
