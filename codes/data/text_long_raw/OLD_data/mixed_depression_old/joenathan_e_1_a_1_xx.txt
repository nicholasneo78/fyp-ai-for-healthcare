Hey, My name is Jonathan. I'm 23 years old. I'm a senior in college hoping to be through very VERY soon. I went through a really rough depression era starting around the age of 15 and lasting till I was 21. It started to get a little better when I got into college, but then severely accelerated throughout the years. I took a year off from school to work and basically to get help, which I did. I found out a lot of my depression was cognitive... thinking negatively about myself. When I was growing up, I was a real shy guy. I think some of that though has turned into a social anxiety issue, but I didn't have a great social. I still don't, but once I got help, the psychologist I saw really helped me get past the negative thinking, but I still have really tightly bound emotional issues from time to time that tend to really upset me. It's taken pieces of my personality and completely do a 180. Part of my depression was that I was co-dependent. Now I'm really completely independent. I guess I'm trying more to understand than to get just advice. I can't make sense of my emotions anymore.
