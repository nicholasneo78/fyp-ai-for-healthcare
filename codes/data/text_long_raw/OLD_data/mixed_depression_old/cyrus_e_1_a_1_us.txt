Things seem to follow you everywhere, things such as thinking of suicide and almost doing it. I did these things a few years ago well in a term of service with the US Army and was put in a ward for a few weeks and then released without even a proper name for what ever I was suffering from, and was sent to Iraq a week after leaving the ward. That as I said was a few years ago and I really never wound up in a hospital again yet, after I returned home and since it seems everyone knew I had one little problem. A problem that seems to plague me even to this day for I am now in the reserves and was yet sent to go back to Iraq but I was sent home due to on going mental problems from a few years ago. What I really want to know is there something really wrong with me or is this just a huge joke. I have been to doctors more then once and just with really nothing to go on but a shaken head. so I just was hoping someone out there knows or been though this really, as for my feelings inside it is hard for me to express I do not like to talk much of what goes on up stairs do to at times I don't really understand why at times I either feel like hurting someone or just having that lump in my throat feeling like I am going to cry but I cannot. Anyway answers please and this is my first ever post here I due hope you can read my rambling.
