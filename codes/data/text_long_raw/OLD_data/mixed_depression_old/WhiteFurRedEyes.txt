Body: Anterior pelvic tilt
So i have APT and im really skinny and its been fucking ruining my life. For more than 1 year ive always thought about my body and i obesses over it. Ive been going to the gym now for 1 month of personal training and not a single difference at all. Not a tiny bit fitter not a tiny bit stronger or anything. Im so fucking depressed. I see people who dont go to the gym and they have muslcey bodys and im like wtf? I feel like everyones a fucking bodybuilder. Its been killing me. My back is like an S shape.
