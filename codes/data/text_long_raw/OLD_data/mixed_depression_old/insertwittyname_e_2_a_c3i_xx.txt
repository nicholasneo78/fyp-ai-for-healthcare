I'm 16 and I've thought about suicide some, never tried yet. I'll tell you about myself. I'm in high school ...   just got my license. I've been to two shrinks, neither for depression but a anger problem, though I don't have one, just Mom and me fight and we've always been close. No one has ever known that I've thought of suicide except when I was in junior high and it wasn't really much true, sure a little but I was more agreeing with my cousin when she said that she has thought of such. Now I've been recently noticing (for a small bit months now) how I have been having some I guess you would say symptoms (pardon my spelling) of depression and all. Especially I've been losing interest in things and feeling guilty over everything and that's the most extreme ones, I have some others too. I've taken online tests and it says that I may have depression. But I can't believe I do. I mean why would I have depression. I would just guess I'm making it up to myself or something. We'll I've always been interesting in  psychology stuff like personality disorders, so maybe I'm just reading into it wrong or something. That would probably be what a shrink would say so I don't want to go to one, plus I don't really like talking to them. Another thing is one of my friends just attempted suicide, lucky survived and if I say something to someone they would think I'm just saying such because of that. I've felt like this before that though .... another thing is I'm a Christian and Christians shouldn't feel this way, right? Can someone help me figure out if I'm just making this up in my head!!!
