I seem to have depression the worst, first thing in the morning lately.  Just started with a new pdoc after 7 months. with another pdoc since this latest episode occured.  My old pdoc thought I could have a mild bipolar disorder but wasn't sure.  My 20 mg of prozac had stopped working after several years of keeping me stable.  She started me on lamictal and I am now up to 100 mg / day.  Stopped the prozac in early January and got worse, but not right away.  I was having a good week / bad week type pattern depending on where I was in my menstrual cycle while I was on the prozac.  I have battled depression on and off for 20 years.  Particularly bad postpartum and this recent episode.  I am 41 years old and haven't felt this bad since I had my daughter 8 years ago. 

My new doctor thinks I don't have an ounce of bipolar and that I am just in a depression (I tend to agree with her).  We decided together to add Lexapro to the mix and see if that helps me level out all the days of the month.  I have been on it almost 2 weeks patiently waiting for some results - I am well aware of the waiting game.  I am also taking Xanax XR in the evenings for sleep and to avert morning anxiety.  I take my Lamictal in the morning and a very small (half of the lowest dose of xanax) as well.  I seem to get moving and can be quite productive during my day after I take the Lamictal / xanax - don't know if this is a placebo effect??

My question is, has anyone experienced this a.m. depression that seems to lift a bit later in the day?  Also, does anyone take Lamictal for unipolar depression?  The last thing I want is to be taking too much of anything and further putting off good health.  Starting to wonder if the Xanax XR in the evening is giving me this early morning dread??
