I see no way out, except to stop this life. I am 59 years old and have not worked since 2004 due to depression and anxiety disorders. I live on social security disability. I barely have enough money to live on. I lost all my savings after losing my job as a teacher. I did make my car payment, but I could not pay my other bills. I have about $14,000 in debts now. I have not been able to work due to depression and panic attacks. I should try to work, but my teaching credential has expired. I would have to move to another area to find a teaching job now, after being let go from my last job here. I am afraid to move away. At my age I should have savings and be ready for retirement (and have retirement). But I have nothing. I rent a room here in expensive Santa Barbara. I am stuck in fear and nothingness. I'm scared and I keep thinking of suicide, but I'm afraid it will not work and I will be worse off. Is anybody in a situation like mine? Does anybody have any words of wisdom?
