I am a 42 year old woman who is single and has no one "special" in my life.  I am becoming my disgusted with my life and where I am.  I really want to make 2006 my year.  Yes I have said that every year since I turned 18.  I am at the lowest point that I didn't want to reach.  I am afraid to sink any lower.

I am currently on effexor and linispril.  Effexor is started to have a negative effect on my heath, but I am so afraid of returning night terrors that I'm afraid to allow my doctor to change it.

I am seeing a counselor but he isn't working on my cognitive behavior.  I need someone to tell me positive things and to help me believe that I am not bad.  He just seems to repeat what I say.  I had someone before who focused on my thought patterns and it helped greatly.
