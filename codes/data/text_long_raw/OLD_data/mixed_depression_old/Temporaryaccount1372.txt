Im just one water molecule in a sea of depression
Nothing feels worthwhile to me anymore. Things I used to enjoy are depressing. Talking to someone about it is incredibly depressing. 

At this point, I dont even really see the point in this. In just living in a loveless life in constant pain with nothing to look forward to. 

But im not special. Other people who are more capable, moral, and intelligent and crestive are depressed and are deserving of your love and affection. They will probably make a recovery. What are you waiting for?
