I find myself hating birthdays and Christmas now
Those are the times when you’re surrounded by friends and feel loved. I don’t get that so I find myself starting to hate it.

And I feel bad about feeling this way? I feel bad that I’m the one who can’t seem to smile and laugh when everyone else around me can do it just fine. 

I feel bad that I’m the one at school that’s known for never smiling. That must be why no one tries to talk to me.
