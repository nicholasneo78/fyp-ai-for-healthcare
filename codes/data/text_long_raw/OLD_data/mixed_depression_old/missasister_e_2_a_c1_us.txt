My twenty year old sister died instantly in a car accident in march of 2005. It has been almost a year, and i have never had a dream about her, until tonight. In the dream, she goes from one family member to another, asking why we are ignoring her. She is extremely upset, and screaming that she doesn't understand. She sees me, starts toward me; and then i wake up. The overall sensation of the dream is that she stayed behind to take care of her fifteen month old daughter, and to give birth to the son she was pregnant with when she died. The strongest thing i picked up from the dream was the sensation that she doesn't know she's dead. Is there any meaning behind this dream? Am I losing my mind?
