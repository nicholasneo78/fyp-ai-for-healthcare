Am I going insane or is this normal? Zoning out
I was always praised for my memory. Didn't ever revise for exams but I'd still get good grades. Nowadays not so much.

I'm constantly 'zoning out'. It's got to the point where I sometimes forget what happened 30 seconds ago. I'll be in shower and zone out for 30 seconds, come back and I can't remember if I washed my hair or not. It's always simple things like that. I still have no problem with studies, remembering appointments and generally anything that matters. Yet, I still check if I closed the fridge door 3 times within a few minutes... 

Am I just getting older? Can this be a symptom of depression or perhaps something more sinister? I feel like this is something I've always had and perhaps everyone else has too, but lately it just seems too frequent to be normal...
