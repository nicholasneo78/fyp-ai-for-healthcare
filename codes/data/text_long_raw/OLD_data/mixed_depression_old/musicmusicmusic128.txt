I need a friend
It's hard to put words to my feelings. I struggle with sounding serious and not coming off as an obnoxious dick. I'm sick of people coming and going and I've grown to hate myself. I don't ever act like the person I am at heart, and I never really have to anyone. I want to get out of this shell. I haven't had friends for years and I've posted here numerous times on alts and my previous account with no reply. I wouldn't be surprised if I get overshadowed by someone with much more clearly obvious issues than me like usual, but if you care, please leave a message. I hope you read this.
