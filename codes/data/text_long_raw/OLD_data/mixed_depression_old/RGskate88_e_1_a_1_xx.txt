Hi I'm Ricky, I'm 17 years old and I think I've been living with depression for the past 2 years. I've been through a lot of issues in my life that makes my life feel so unbearable and lonely. I haven't been through any therapy so I haven't been diagnosed with depression but I obviously haven't been feeling happy. I'm a senior in high school and I hate going to school every morning, I don't feel like I fit in really. Reasons are because I'm a social outcast and I don't really like being around other people because I may seem to be off tangent. People seem to judge me too quickly and this really pisses me off, or is it that I'm way too paranoid. I zone out a lot and just stare at people without even saying a word to any of them. Like I'm really anxious around them and I feel completely uncomfortable. I started smoking weed when I was a sophomore and ever since then people such as my friends seem to drift away but it didn't really bother me till now. I don't really have that many close friends other than just friends that I smoke with. My parents say I should avoid those friends just so I can get a better perspective in my life but then I don't know how to make new ones. I really want to make new ones because I want to have a better social life but I don't know how to get myself motivated. I want someone to care for like a girl friend, just so that I don't feel so lonely, but then again I don't think I can have a healthy relationship. My parents also say that I should be more open with God but I don't have any faith (if I don't even have any faith in myself, how could I have any with God). I just turn away and just hide and just think that it will all be different the next day but never is. Please I need some help because I don't want to feel even more depressed. Ricky
