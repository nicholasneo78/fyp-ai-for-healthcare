I messed up...
I'm not gonna beat around the bush. I tried to kill myself. I freaked out at the last minute and stopped the worst of the bleeding but now I have a huge, bloody gash on my wrist.  
I don't want anybody to find out but I won't be able to hide it for long. It's bleeding all over the palce and the most I have to cover it is shitty plasters. What the fuck am I supposed to do now???
