I wasn't going to do it, I really wasn't. I was off in my own little happy medicine head world, but he had to go and ruin it for me. He sure as HELL didn't need to invite his fucking parents over at 8am Saturday morning. I don't know what's worse, the fact he invited them over that early or the fact that he's leaving at 9am and leaving me alone with the them. FOAD dear husband. You certainly earned it. Oh and FOAD IL's for even thinking of showing the fuck up at my house at 8 am. SHAME ON YOU. Screw the medicine, I'll just bang my head against the wall. Either way my head will still feel like crap. One more thing, FOAD Cars. Yes that cute little kid's movie. Little Man's new favorite expression is "KA-CHOW!", and I can't tell you how fucking annoying that is. (Whew can I swear any more in this post? I don't think so......ow. My poor head)
