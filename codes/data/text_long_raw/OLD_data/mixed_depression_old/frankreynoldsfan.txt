Can somone help me find a documentary on mental illness?
I saw this older documentary about this baseball player who had a mental breakdown  awhile back. He wasn't famous. It was on youtube. Does this sound familiar? He had a beard and so did his dad. He lived in a mental hospital. It was like from the 80s I'm pretty sure.
