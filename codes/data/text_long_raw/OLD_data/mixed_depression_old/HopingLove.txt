Gets worse by the day lately
Lately... the depression has been getting worse as each new day arrives. It’s getting to the point where I am afraid of my own mind and thoughts. Lately I’ve been hoping that i don’t wake up from my sleep. In the past six months, I’ve lost two people that I loved so much. One was my best friend of 8 years, we dated for a year and broke up but remained friends until about six months ago. He started to ignore me out of no where. Tried my best to talk to him but... he was the cause of why my depression spiraled back so bad that I almost took my own life. Then I met another guy about 5 months earlier... he liked me, I liked him, I fell in love with him. He knew of my ex/best friend and what he did to me. Guy number two said he wouldn’t do what guy number one did to me... and now I feel like he is doing the same exact thing that guy number one did to me... we haven’t talked in two weeks. I know two weeks isn’t that long to not talk, but... seeing as guy number one didn’t talk to me for two weeks... I can’t help that guy number two is doing the same exact thing and ignoring me and somehow I will lose him as friend. Sadly... I fell really hard for guy number two... 


Sorry for the long story but... as a person that’s been battling depression for the last 13 years, I just feel like if I left the world, no one would notice or even care... 

Thank you to who ever takes the time to read this...
