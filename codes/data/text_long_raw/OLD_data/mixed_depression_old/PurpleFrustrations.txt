I don't know what to do with my life and I'm running out of time.
Lately I feel like I'm expecting too much about life, I'm afraid that it will never be what i wanted it to be. I feel that my dreams will never come true. And I don't even have a dream.

Since I don't know what to do with my life and what career to study, the only thing I can is overthink. I know I'm young but thinking about the future makes me so anxious. The only thing I want is to be happy.

My friends in school always rushed me about my career, they made fun of me because I didn't know what to study. I was the best in my class so they were surprised. I stopped talking to them because I was so ashamed about dropping out university. I started studying IT Engineer career but I couldn't take it. I feel like that wasn't for me. I'm afraid that I would never find something that I really like. Please don't judge me like them.

I don't want to go outside, I don't want to people see me, I'm such a failure.
I feel like i'm dissapointing everyone in my family. I wanted to help them, but I can't do anything. I don't know anything. I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm running out of time. I'm a mess. I just wish I could dissapear.
