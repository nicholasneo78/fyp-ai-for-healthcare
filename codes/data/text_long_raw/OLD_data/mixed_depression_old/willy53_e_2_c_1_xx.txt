Thank You ArtChick and Tempesta , all of you who have been here for me. I'm so glad that you all understand. I really want to get out from behind this trapped door. My life is so controlled and he doesn't even see it. He denies it when i bring it up. I cry because i can't buy things for my children or grandchildren. This isn't the way it is suppose to be. One of the reasons I don't make it to church on some Sundays is because I don't have clothes to wear. I have a pair of black jeans i keep switching jackets and shirts so i don't look the same every Sunday. My daughter bought me a nice dress and it was warm enough last Sunday to wear it. I guess i shouldn't care about what people think and all the people at my church are wonderful, not judgmental. I do go to the Lord in Prayer every morning and study my Bible. I feel content because we are supposed to give all our worries to him and not get in his way of taking care of them. I know God is working in my life, my daughter finding this site is just one of the ways i know. my husband just got a job after being out of work for a year. I prayed for that too. He didn't just get a job but he got a good job. I told him he didn't get it on his own. I know I am going to get better eventually. Thank all of you for being here for me. I will keep all of you in my prayers too.
