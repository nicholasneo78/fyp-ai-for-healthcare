It’s my birthday and I’m done being miserable!
I’ve been very depressed for about 3 years now. I stayed to myself. Didn’t work, didn’t hang out with friends. Today is my 26th birthday. For the past few weeks, I’ve hammered the idea into my head that my 26th year will be the year that I pull myself out of my hole and get my shit together. 

I have a job interview tomorrow morning. One step at a time! I’m determined!

UPDATE- I’m currently sitting on the side of the highway because my car broke down on the way to the interview. Why do I even try?!
