I'm from MD and I too am going through a depression / anxiety moment in my life. I am just always feeling unappreciated like no one really cares about me as a person, unless they need something from me, I am currently overweight, I feel ugly, I have absolutely no motivation in life whatsoever to want to do ANYTHING. If I could sleep all the time I would. My Mother, whom is or was my best friend ,never calls me unless she need money, clothes, etc. My Sister, she never calls unless she need a ride somewhere, my kids are the same way, my Husband on the other hand does not make any moves to want to make love together when we go to bed, years ago he would used to then he stopped because I never did, but we moved past that dumb shit or so I thought, now when I try he will, but he never does anymore, I am not going to make that move all the time, it's all just a game and I can't play it anymore. It's childish and I just don't need that on top of everything else I'm dealing with. I have a problem with dealing with people, like trying to have a conversation with someone sometimes is hard for me, I feel nervous and get all tongue tied when I'm talking to people, it don't happen with everyone I deal with, just some. I have friends, but they never call me, I have to call them, and it's like they ALL do this, is it me? Is it something I'm doing wrong? I just don't know anymore. I feel like I want to take something sometimes, I feel like I want to run away sometimes, I don't feel suicidal at all, so I guess there's hope. Well that's pretty much all about me. I hope to maybe make some new friends on here.
