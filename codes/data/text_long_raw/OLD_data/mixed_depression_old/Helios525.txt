The grass isn't green anywhere; the grass is fucking dead
I don't give a damn about what people say about the grass being green on the other side or where you water it or whatever. It doesn't matter. NOTHING will satisfy me. Maybe I expect too much from the world, but when I put the work in (something seen few and far between these days), I just want some form of pride or happiness or something. The grass is dead. It is, it has been, and it always will be. This small existence will never mean anything.
