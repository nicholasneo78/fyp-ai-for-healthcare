if you're lonely..
F/17/AUS
I'm very active online and have insomnia, so timezones probably aren't an issue. I am very loyal and caring, with lots of love to give, especially to those who can show that they want it :)

I have depression too, I'm very miserable and lonely, occasionally suicidal. Yet I am optimistic at heart, so feel free to PM me if you think a chat with me is what you need to feel a little better...
