Hi there. My name is Tim, I am 38 years old and live in the UK. I have been prescribed 40mg of paroxetine, but stopped taking it a couple of months ago as it wasn't helping me in my situation, which has probably made me physically worse. My depression probably stems from low self esteem and the feeling of general failure. I have suffered for 19 years now, not constantly, as "success" at work can suppress it (i.e. times when I feel I am contributing something). To the outside world I probably appear relatively "normal" I have to stop now as I need to go out, I'll try and articulate where I am coming from later
