I went to College for Political Science. Now I can't stand politics.
When I started college in 2012, my goal was to join the foreign service to represent my country to people abroad. I loathe Trump and all he stands for. My grandmother lost every single relative in Europe to the Nazis, and two days after the election I saw another student at the University come in wearing an SS logo. And with Nazis marching every month I am am ashamed to be American. I have been running behind in college for a while, but as long as I had serving my country to look forward to I kept going. At this point though I would rather be dead than associated with this country.

 I can't even avoid the toxicity of politics because that is what my degree is in. I spent the last year trying as hard as I could to think of any reason to keep going. I can't find one. I wrote my first suicide note last month all about my feeling of meaninglessness in a country that killed the country I loved. 

While I wallowed in self loathing, I have costed my mother so much money. Once my sister started college she had to cash out her 401k to keep us both in college because I didn't get a scholarship and didn't graduate. I would get a job, but I don't have a driver's license and public transportation doesn't go by my house. When I drop out of school my student loans will come due, and if I can't pay them my family will try. The only way out I can think of is death. My student loans are of a type that are forgiven if I die, so my family would save more by just paying to have me buried than to pay off my debt.
