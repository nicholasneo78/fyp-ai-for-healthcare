Why am I like this?
Every time I try to step out of my comfort zone and try to be more outgoing/"normal" so people will think a little better of me perhaps, I just completely fuck everything up. I don't even feel like leaving my bed anymore.

Why I'm posting this right niw: I somehow convinced a girl that I'm not a complete idiot, and we're together. Since she's ill, I thought I'd swing by and give her a little "get well soon" kit with soup, tea, chocolate, that kinda stuff. All that came back was a half assed thank you, no comment on anything in the damn thing I've planned for a week now. I didn't expect much reaction, since she doesn't seem to like spending time with me anyways, but a little more would have been nice. I guess I'm just bad at everything I touch. 

And since I don't have any friends to talk to, I have to bother you nice people with this. Sorry you had to read this far, just continue scrolling now. Needed to get it off my chest
