I'm not exactly sure what the topic is (kind of vague), but for me: Depression started around the age of 11 (I'm almost 23 now), one summer I was sitting in my room, laying on my bed, listening to music, and gazing out the window, and it kind of hit me like a ton of bricks. I just felt like I didn't even exist.  Like the world outside my window didn't exist. Like the sun would never shine again.  Like life itself was pointless. I tried to talk to my mom about it, but she obviously didn't understand what I was saying to her, she told me I needed to do more work around the house to keep myself busy... look at me now...
