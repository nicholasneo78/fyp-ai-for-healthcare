Hi everyone. My name is Charlie and I have suffered from occasional bouts of depression for a while. Something that has recently taken my interest is the inferiority complex and how this affected my perceptions of things. I first got onto the idea through a page called Depression Hurts at a Hypnosis site 121 hypnosis (its worth plugging as I have found it useful). It took a while to admit to myself that I was afraid of not belonging, being criticized, sarcastic remarks at work etc and it stems back to horrid teachers and kids at school. This has been a turning point for me though - working through the false learnings and memories, so I thought I'd share it in case it resonates with anyone else. I've since recognized symptoms of inferiority in others (and they vary widely from conceited arrogance to total withdrawal), and it's been really great.
