I’m 21 almost 22 and I feel like I haven’t accomplished enough at my age.
My age has been bothering me so much because everyone else my age is already ten steps ahead of me. I still live with my parents and it’s so embarrassing and I’m trying to save up to move out, but my social anxiety has caused my employer to cut my hours.
