Why am I like this?
Sometimes I feel really depressed, i think I'm at the lowest of my life and I can't do anything productive, I'm so tired. And, like, an hour after, I feel like my depression isn't real and that I can do anything and I feel good and see all the things I can do to feel better. But, not long after that, I fall back and I'm so tired again. Is anyone else like this?
