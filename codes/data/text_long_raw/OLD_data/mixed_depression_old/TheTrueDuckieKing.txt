I start my first job tommorow
I've been a lurker here for a long time. I'm 19 m, and I somehow finally got motivated enough to apply for and somehow qualify for a job. College has been really up and down for me, but somehow something good happened for once. Idk I just wanted to share, I'm super nervous but I thought some of you might be able to relate to how much this simple thing means to me.
