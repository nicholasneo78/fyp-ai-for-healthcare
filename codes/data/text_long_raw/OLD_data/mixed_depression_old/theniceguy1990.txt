Ever just sit there and wonder what's the point?
Is it all really worth it? 
The hard work. At the job,  on you're self.  And whatever else. 

I mean if this is all im gonna be as a person even after all this hard work... what's the point.  
At the end of the day the only thing i really end up looking forward to is sleeping.  It's honestly the only time I feel okay.  

It's all gone when i sleep,  I'm at peace.  My mind isnt running through everything that makes me feel like trash. 

Is it worth it to continue working as hard as i do at Work? All I ever do is get shafted  or picked on. 

What about going to therapy,  is it worth it to keep going? I mean yeah,  i have someone to vent to and they listin to me. They don't tell me things like, "you have no reason to feel this way" or things like that.  

I mean i really don't see a way out of this place.  What am I gonna find to "make it go away" 

Some days are bearable, but some days I just wish i could stay in my dreams all day. Sleeping, no hurting. Just.... peace... 

If got a few new things to bring up to my therapist in two weeks i guess... 

Thanks for reading.
