It's sad that all I look forward to on weekends is getting fucked up.
Not even look forward to, more like, chasing the temporary relief that drugs once gave me. Now they just make me feel like shit, but I still try in the hopes that it'll make me feel better again.

Atleast they help me relax and forget for a little bit.
