Lately, I've been going to sleep later and later into the day just so I can avoid ppl and avoid dealing with depression/being sad. But, by the time I do wake up/can't sleep anymore, I feel more depressed than when I originally was.
And yet, despite all of that, I still have this need to sleep excessively because I keep having dreams that are more entertaining, adventurous, and exciting than what's currently going on in my life. 

And even when I rewire my sleep schedule back to normal, I still end up going back to the messed up sleep schedule just cause I hate feeling depressed and hate dealing with it.
