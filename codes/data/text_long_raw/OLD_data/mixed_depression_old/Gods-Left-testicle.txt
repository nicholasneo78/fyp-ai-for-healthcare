I'm quitting my job.
I've been working at a department store for about 5 months yet, and I just can't do it anymore.  There's too much to know and I just can't keep up.  People who have been there 3 weeks are telling me how to do things.  

I sat down with my manager this morning and explained it all.  The crying in the bathroom, the calling in sick because I'm too scared to go in, everything. She was really nice about it, and I decided to put in my notice.  

It feels like a failure, but I gave it my best try, and it isn't working out.  

I feel relieved that I only have 2 more weeks.  I don't have another job lined up yet but I had to get out.  I know that's not a good choice, but the anxiety is so intense there.  

I feel like a bit of a failure.  A blind labradoodle could do this job haha.  

Ah well, can't win em all, right?
