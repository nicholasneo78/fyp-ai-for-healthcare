Ice 'n' snow 'n' sleet...damn! We had to stay an extra night in B-ham because of the icy roads between here and there. I had an obscenely fun time, and it reaffirmed that I am a complete sucker for 4-part harmonies. The Tallassee Gold Edition male show choir was freaking fantastic--they sang "Carry On, Wayward Son", "Gaston" from Beauty and the Beast, "One More Day" from Les Mis (heartx10,000,000), and "It's Hip to Be Square" *dies over and over*. Our female show choir swept the awards in the women's division, it was awesome XD A unanimous, high-pitched clamor that is probably still reverberating through the atmosphere in Africa or something... The co-ed show choir got first runner-up in their division, plus best costumes and best choreography. Yet, the choir that beat us won no caption awards...*grumbles something about blind and deaf show choir bureaucrats* Oh, and the Enterprise show choir sang "Letters From War". I CRIED LIKE A BABY. I always do when I hear that song. And apparently I'm hysterical at midnight. At least, according to Katherine and Quinn, two saxophonists I was rooming with. Please let school be cancelled tomorrow. Oh please please please.
