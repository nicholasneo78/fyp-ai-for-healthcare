Hi everyone! I've been trying to find something or someone to help me out depression for ages, but I'm not an open person and it's been very difficult for me. I was never happy with my life and been just running away from problems. I left home when I was 18 and went to London. I wanted to start new life, but moved 11 times since then and always hoped I'll be happy in the new place. But it's getting worse and worse, I'm back home now, and start to realize, that I have nowhere to run and I'm getting old for that. I had a best friend in London, but she just used me and left when my ex went to jail. I have no one to talk to and I found so difficult to find new friends. I never talk about my problems, just to myself, when I'm with people, I'm completely different person, I'm so shy and I hate it. I hate it when I want to say something, but my mind doesn't let me and I'm just upset on myself. I don't remember the morning, when I woke up with a good mood or without headache. I've been thinking so much, that even when I stop I still feel this horrible pain in my head. I tried to bring my confidence up with drugs, but they just made it worse and I feel even more depressed. I've been thinking everyday. What am I going to do? and what is the worse about all this is that when I decide something what I feel is right and in few hours or minutes I think about it again and my feelings change and change again. ...it's driving me crazy. I'm getting so sensitive on everything, I'm crying from watching a stupid cartoon, or listening to the music, I feel sick or strange high on everything I put in my mouth. I think I've lost myself, I can't see the point of life anymore. Suicide? I tried that, but now I'm afraid of death, I'm afraid of everything. I would be glad if I could find some friends here... at least one, who understand and could beat this depressive moods with me. Love, Angela, 23
