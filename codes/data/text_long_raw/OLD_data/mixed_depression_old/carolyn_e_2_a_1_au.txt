Hey Wurtle's back! For the record I disagree and think John Howard made an excellent choice, all his decisions are excellent. I cannot be held responsible for the ranting of a turtle. Oh and Morven he thanks you for the email and will respond to it once he had stopped banging his head against the glass and going "Fucking Windshuttle, fucking ABC, fucking country going to the crapper". I am going to have to do something about his foul language, really it's just inappropriate. This week's renter is "The Alien" (methinks that is not her real name) you should click on her site. It is good. Her engagement story is cute. People keep getting engaged (my cousin Bec is the latest) and I still need a boyfriend. It isn't fair *sob*. You should also check out her web design site.
