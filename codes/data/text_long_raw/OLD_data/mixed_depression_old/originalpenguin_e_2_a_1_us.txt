Driving back home from dropping my cousins off, I began to think about my future actions. I'm fully committed to this. I know that when I start, there's no going back. If I don't succeed, if this becomes a botched suicide attempt, there really will be no life after that. My parents will hate me. My friends will leave me or treat me with kid gloves. Either way, I suffer even more than I suffer now. It doesn't seem possible that my suffering can grow but I know that if I don't continue or succeed, it will. I honest to goodness don't know what's wrong with me. I mean, why do I have to feel like this? Nothing I've done to make things right with myself has helped. Things just keep getting worse for me. Before, I let it go because I understood that the bad needs to happen before the good. That you have to have the bad with the good. I kept on waiting for the good. I didn't expect sunshine and rainbows but I expected some sort of light, even a tiny bit. I expected a slight reprieve from the evil, dark thoughts swirling in my mind. No. Everything just seemed to worsen with time, with me. They say that time heals all wounds but time has just worsened mine.
