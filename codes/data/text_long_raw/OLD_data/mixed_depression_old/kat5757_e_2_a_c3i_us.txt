I'm 19 and I'm severely depressed.  I am at my wits end and i don't know what to do any more.  I feel empty inside and the only way I feel something is when I cut myself.  I don't care what feeling comes out, whether it's pain, adrenaline, or guilt ...  I don't care what feeling, but I need to feel something.  I keep thinking that death will be a sweet surrender and I use to be scared to do it but now I'm not so sure anymore ...  I keep thinking how blissful it would be to finally set myself free, to let my pain and suffering disintegrate along with my soul.  Every time I think of this, I smile ... and it scares me.  I smile at the thought of death. 

I don't how to stop and I feel as if there is no end to this misery.  I stopped talking to therapists, psychologists, counselors, etc.  There is no hope.
