Does anyone else's depression show itself as exhaustion?
I find as I get older, that certain heavy type of exhaustion that can only be caused by depression gets more and more pervasive. As soon as things start going downhill, the unexplained tiredness hits and I become like a zombie. I have no energy to do my normal daily tasks, the thought of going through my evening routine before bed seems like climbing a fucking mountain; I barely have the energy to do anything other than sit on the couch and stare into space. The physical lethargy always comes hand-in-hand with the Brain Fog. Forget trying to study, forget going through the bills, my brain can't handle anything except moving my index finger to scroll down Reddit and watching cheap entertainment on youtube or Netflix. 

I'm writing this because I'm in it now - in the Fog - and I'm lagging behind in life. Does anyone else feel this way? Does anyone know how to get out?
