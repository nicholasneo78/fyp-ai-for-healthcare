I read "The Art of Happiness" a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it. The Dalai Lama is something else. I've forgotten a lot of it but I do remember him saying that we should strive to be unswayed by emotion so that we don't differentiate between good things happening or bad things. I am the opposite of this. When good things happen I feel good. When bad things happen I feel bad. I loved what you said about there being no such thing as self loathing in Tibet. I wonder if this means there is no depression. I've always wanted to be a monk. Maybe that's the answer. Thanks for the interesting post Harlequin. I will now go and Google breathing meditation. By the way, can anyone tell me how to post partial quotes? Do I have to erase the bits I don't want posted after hitting +quote or is there another way?
