I just need my spirit to settle
In its totality it doesn't have to be about wins and loses,  or what I failed to do.  Neither does it have to be about my past years and the thoughts that come with immense feelings that appears to haunt me.  The behaviors and mentality that I have doesn't have to be the end all be all.  One major thing to include that its not about growth or conquering something in life.  I'm not living to grow or to become strong after a catastrophic situation.  I am looking for my spirit to simply just settle.  I'm not seeking any advice nor trying to raise my fist towards challenges.  I'm not seeking any of that just a settling of the inner me.  To me,  that is important than anything else because I would gladly be able to live with that when I one day be out of this earth. I'm not the goal oriented type.  Its not about climbing this ladder of life. I'm not here for any of what most people are striving for.  I seek for my spirit to settle for all these years.  That is what I'm chasing.  Most people are chasing dreams,  families,  success,  marriages,  money,  respect,  and fame,  but not this human.  More power to them and I'm sure they will obtain all those things but I for one am not seeking to obtain.  The human game is a serious thing filled with losses and wins.  I don't wanna count anymore nor try to get to the next level of life.  Cycling through the infinite regrets and regression. The only goal is for this spirit to settle some type of way.  I'm gunning for an internal calmness.  Something that can penetrate and flood the mind of mine.  Something that can provide some internal at ease like affect for myself.  So I say to my spirit,  I hope you settle.
