I'm 23 years old female. i began lexapro February 8,2006  My doctor gave me lexapro. i have used zoloft when i was like 16 years old but only used it for a month. my question is , is there anyone who's been on lexapro and how has it worked for them. the first day i took it which was yesterday i took my first pill in morning 10 mg i felt dizzy and i felt like my head was expanding and felt sleepy but then again i would always sleep a lot before this.  my sex drive is gone. i feel i don't have no urge whatsoever.  i don't have no craving for food as much as i did before. or maybe because i was bored and depressed i just ate but i don't know. and i see a lot of people who say they gained and lost weight on this pill but I've only been on it for 2 days so i can't say nothing yet on that. i will be coming back to update on how I'm doing.  but anyone on lexapro please feel free to comment. I'd love to hear what you have to say.
