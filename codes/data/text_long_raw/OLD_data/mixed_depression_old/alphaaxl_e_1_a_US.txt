I know this might not fall under "depression", but it strongly relates to my depression. Example: Today I ran into a kid Brendon from my school and he said hi and started to talk to me. I went on with the conversation, but felt so uncomfortable. I know him and all, but after the conversation, I find myself saying "Wow...that was awful...I suck at life." I hate myself and I always think that everyone is laughing at me. Even when two people are laughing I always think that they're laughing at me. I'm purposely putting off my license test because of this fear. Does anyone have any helping words? Thank you everyone.
