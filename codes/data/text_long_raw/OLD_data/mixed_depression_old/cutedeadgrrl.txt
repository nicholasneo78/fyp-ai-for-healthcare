How to not be discouraged that I suck and people younger than me are better
Love playing guitar and piano but I'm 16 and people who are like fucking 7.8,9, 10 are beasts like I wish I could join a band and shit like them but I just started playing like a month ago and I'm really bad and slow and horrible and not progressing st the rate I want to even though I put in so much effort :/ also playing gives me anxiety even though I like it I'm always just so scared and agitated ):
