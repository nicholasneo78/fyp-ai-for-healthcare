I had my second appointment with my naturopathic doctor today. I'm getting this feeling that she is really just a therapist for people who don't want to go to a therapist. She lets me ramble on about all sorts of things that have very little to do with my health. Like what our rules for Jeffrey and food are. Last time she gave me a series of homeopathic remedies (Undas) to support my liver. This time it was a capsule called Ichol. I'm not sure if these things do anything more than lighten my wallet, but I'm willing to try them for now. I do desperately need to lose weight and if there is any chance that these things will help, I'm willing to go for it for a while. I've been searching the net reading about Katirina and other personal tragedies that bloggers are going through and I'm sort of jealous. My life is just full of 'normal' stuff right now. My grandpa died in August and we went to his funeral but it doesn't affect my life in a large way. Just in the morally rehensible way that now I don't have to feel guilty about not going to see him. It's not that I didn't want to see him, I just never found the time and now I don't have to worry about it. At some level I'm sure that means that I'm headed to eternal damnation. In other news, we've managed to find a geo-cache. It took us three trips to the spot because dusk is not the time to find dark colored boxes hidden in an unlit forest. Even if it is just 2 kilometers southwest of our house on a really nice nature trail.
