I had a lousy night. I went to a street dance with my PARENTS, and was just so alone. I have been single for two months, and meeting new guys in my small town is so hard. I don't drink or do drugs, and that's all a lot of them do. I work an evening shirt at the local factory, and I can't seem to find anyone with the same interests and values as me. I'm really in to horses and the outdoors and everyone my age just seems to want to get drunk and party. I'm already depressed, and this whole thing is just not helping. I'm close to my parents, and I love spending time with them, but I'm afraid guys just see me as some loser who can't grow up or something. Does anyone have any advice on how to just meet people who aren't into parting? Does anyone else come from small towns with this same problem! Thanks bunches.
