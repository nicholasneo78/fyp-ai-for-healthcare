God
"God moves towards those who need him the most and those who are emotionally broken" Really ? Well where the fuck has he been for the past three years in my life? I am tired of asking God to make me feel less depressed and never getting an answer. I guess he doesn't give a shit about me, but that's okay, because now I don't give a shit about him either.
