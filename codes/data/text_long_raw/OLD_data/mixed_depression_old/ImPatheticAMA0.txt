I spend to many days trying not to cry
Being around people does not help me one bit and it's not their fault. Every time I leave the house I get so sad over everything. It's awful 

To many times someone In the sevic industry just says hello and I feel the need to tell them my lifestory to make me feel better. Sorry about that....
