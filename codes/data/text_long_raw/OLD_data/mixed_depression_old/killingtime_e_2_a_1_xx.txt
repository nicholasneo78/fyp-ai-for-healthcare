I posted here sometime in December I think. I was having tons of digestive problems, well it's been about 4 months now and I'm still having them, but now I also feel extremely fatigued all the time too, I've had test after test and seen doctor after doctor, everything comes back negative. I was actually put on Zoloft for about a month but taken off of it to try other things b/c that wasn't doing the trick either. I'm back to thinking that it's all in my head, I'm now on b12 shots but those aren't doing anything either. I feel like a zombie, I have zero energy and zero motivation to do anything. Even the simplest task like styling my hair seems like a huge chore that I just want to put off. All I want to do is sleep all day. One thing I've noticed is that man do I ever waste time, I mean I literally do nothing but waste time most of the day. I only have about two hours of class per day and no job so I have tons of free time to waste away. I analyzed what I did in the past hour and it basically went like this: The entire time I was talking to myself non-stop, analyzing things, analyzing my situation, thinking of motivational quotes etc.... I tend to do that all day. For about 15 minutes I stood around leaning against a wall, the next 15 minutes i leaned against the television, then I went and lied down for a while all while still thinking and analyzing things in my head, then I came on the computer to just look at random, pointless things. And that is pretty much how most of my time is spent, I might spend an hour or so just standing around or sitting doing nothing but thinking or daydreaming, that can't possibly be healthy and I obviously have way too much free time, I'm just not sure if this is what is in turn causing all my fatigue and sickness. Have I become so addicted to this lifestyle that my mind will purposely make me feel sick so I have an excuse to live like this?
