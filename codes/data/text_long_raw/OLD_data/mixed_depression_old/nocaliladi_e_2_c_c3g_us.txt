I have never had dreams that I can remember, before I started treatment for depression.  Oh sure, everyone once in a while, I would wake up and know that I was in the middle of a dream when I woke, but I know at times I could go for weeks on end and never feel as if I had dreamt or if I had, I couldn't remember.  I also know or have been told, we all dream every night, it's a fact, we just don't remember them. 

Since I have been taking medication for depression (Effexor and Klonopin), I dream every night!  And not just one, several dreams.  They are very vivid, most of them don't make any sense but some of them do.  It just amazes me how much I dream now and the things I dream about and can remember!

Has anyone experienced this and can it be related to the medications?
