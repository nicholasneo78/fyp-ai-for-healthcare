Having a heart stinks sometimes. :/
So Reddit I met this girl on a dating site, and it was going great. Texting was really fun, and we talked about a bunch of different stuff, then when we had a lunch date. Afterward she then didn't really respond to anything I sent her. This morning she tells me that there wasen't a connection. I'm a tiny bit upset, and I'm not to sure what to do.
