I am 18 years old.  I moved out of my house in with my boyfriend when I was 17.  We had known each other for a year and then started going out.  We bought a place and moved in together two weeks after going out.  We both just wanted to get out of our houses.  Well 2 months later we found out that i was pregnant with our son cameron.  We then had him on christmas day of 2005.  I love my son and i love my fiance, but only being 18 i feel trapped.  My fiance who will be 21 in april also has md (muscular dystrophy).  I have to help take care of him, the house, our 2 month old son, and i work.  Only being 18 i feel so overwhelmed.  My fiance and i have had a lot of problems.  I don't feel like he appreciates me.  When we are alone and the baby is over at a grandparent's house all we do is sit at home watching tv.  He just doesn't understand that i need to get out and do stuff.  We fight constantly about the same thing.  I need romance, I need to feel appreciated, I need to feel that something is about me, and I need the feeling of being loved.  I know my fiance loves me and i love him but how do i get him to understand that i need a life outside of being a fiance and a mother?
