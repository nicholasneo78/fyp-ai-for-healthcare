I suffer from major depression too and I have taken almost all of the SSRI's but the only one that really helped me was Lexapro. I took it for around 2 month's, then decided that I didn't want to become addicted to another medication so I just stopped taking it and it didn't bother me at all. I have been taking 100 mil of Elavil at bedtime which is also an antidepressant but I take it to help me sleep. It used to help control my depression but it doesn't anymore and really doesn't help me sleep either. Have you ever tried Lexapro? I think it's the best SSRI one can be on and I had no side effects while taking it so you might want to ask your doctor about it. If there is an alternative treatment for major depression I would like to know what it is. I really have no reason to be depressed as I have a very loving, supportive husband 4 wonderful children, 10 grandchildren and 6 great-grand children. Both my husband and I are retired and this is a time when I should really be enjoying my life but there is a void which I can't explain. I don't want for anything. I have a beautiful home, a new Durango but the material things aren't what makes one happy. I've been told that one chooses to be happy or unhappy but I certainly don't choose to be unhappy and I don't know anyone who would. I am a devout Christian and I know that my depression isn't coming from God but I'm letting the Devil tell me that I'm depressed. Maybe God is just trying to bring me closer to Him and I need to lay my burden of depression at His feet and tell him that I can't get through this alone, then just forget about it but for me it isn't that easy. Three of my 4 children are taking antidepressants so I guess depression might be hereditary (spelling?). I will pray for you to feel better and will you please pray for me too? Thank you.
