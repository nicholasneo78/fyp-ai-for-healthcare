Losing years at a time to depression, 27 still haven't finished 4 year degree.
I don't know what to do. I don't know how to cope! At this point I have no idea how to even get back to the pathetic life I used to have.

I feel like the most pathetic person on redditt, I keep reading about other people who feel like they messed up because of depression and I feel like in comparison they are all doing amazing! I just don't know what to do any more. 

I just turned 27 I have been in university since I was 18, trying to finish a four year degree,  I was on my way to be done university May 2016 and then as per usual I needed extensions for all of my last four courses.... that was almost two full years ago.........  I still have three more papers...


WTF is wrong with me... I haven't worked in 5 years, I live in a property owned by my parents and live off 1000 dollars a month that's from settlement from an accident (it will end very soon).  I go weeks at a time without leaving the house. I spend every day telling myself I will do a little home work and then reward myself with some kind of self care but instead I spend all day every day doing nothing and intentional wasting time until its time for bed. I dont know why I do this and I hate myself for it.

Went to therapy for four years made me feel like garbage. Tried five different therapists one on one and three different groups.  

Has anyone been through anything like this? Has any one gotten out of their own self created self destructive hell??

I feel stupid, Ive struggled with depression my whole life and it was one thing when I was a kid growing up in an abusive and dysfunctional family but Ive been an adult for almost a decade now and ill I've done is fuck myself over by being a stupid coward.
