I feel like I don't have a heart anymore, or a soul, or a personality, whatever. It's been broken too many times by people and by myself. I don't know how to feel anything anymore. I feel empty, bored and lonely. I wish I wasn't here but I don't want to die, but I feel like I'll end up doing it one day.
