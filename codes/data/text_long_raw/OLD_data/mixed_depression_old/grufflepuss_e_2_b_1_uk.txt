If you don't want periods (or PMS) at all there is the 3 monthly injection - Depo-provera - in the UK. It doesn't work the same for everyone (like all medicines) but for me it stopped all periods and kept my depression down to such a level that I could function "normally". I stopped having the 1 week mood swings, 1 week misery, 1 week mood swings, 1 week ok cycle. If that's not an option for you there is a herb supplement that I tried called Agnus Castus. It seems to have beneficial effects for most "women's problems" from aching breasts to full blown menopause. And it can have the side effect of weight loss (not a bad thing for me ) I was on it for ten years at a time and got to the stage where when I came off it and had a period again I had completely forgotten what they were really like! And things have wings now. The PMS didn't cause my depression but it certainly didn't help it. Hope this is helpful
