Me too.
You want a friend. You want someone to be there with you when you’re weak, and someone to comfort you when you’re down. You wish you weren’t alone but you feel invisible. You’re trapped in your thoughts and nobody can reach you. You feel like you can’t do anything right, like you’re useless. Everybody has friends except for you. You’re a burden and nobody actually likes you, you just exist. You push people away because you feel like you don’t have anything to offer, so you’d rather just be left alone. You can’t wait to die because life is pointless. You don’t want to get up anymore because you’ve been knocked down too many times. You’re so tired and weak, and the weight is crushing you even more. Every day that passes is the same and you feel like you’re waiting for nothing. Life can’t get any better because it just sucks and you wish you didn't exist.
