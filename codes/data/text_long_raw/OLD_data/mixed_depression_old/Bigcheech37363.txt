Dropping out of college?
I can’t find the point in my classes, the confusing and silly assignments they give. School was never my thing to be exact, I did decent but didn’t really ever try to get super good grades. That kinda thing just seems silly to me. Salute to everyone in school or college, I hope your doing well. 

I would drop out right now but i know that my family would look down on me. They think the only way out for me is school, and I hate school with a passion and manage to blow it off everytime. I feel like I could go back to college, you know, go back and get the shit u need. But where I’m at right now.... working only 20 some hours and managing to be broke every week from drug use and other stuff from being so stressed and unhappy. I personally feel I would enjoy my life so much better if I didn’t have school right now. I’ve never said that and I just wanted to tell someone. 

Idk what I’m going to do but these are my thoughts that I can’t contain at the moment.
