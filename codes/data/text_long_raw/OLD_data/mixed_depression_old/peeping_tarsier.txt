I think you guys might understand this.
I was walking with a close friend after having lunch together, and I told her, "I feel as if I'm living on borrowed time."

She asked me to explain further, but I couldn't find the words to better express that perspective.

She then proceeded to recount to me all of the myriad ways she's nearly died on some of the trips she's taken.

I confessed that I couldn't really relate to those sorts of situations or how they've affected her, as she has more zeal for life than anyone I've ever met.

Whatever she was describing about perceived proximity to death didn't suit me.

Then the words came to me.

I feel as if I'm living on borrowed time, because I feel like I could, at any moment, lose what little will to live I have left.

It's like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I see it in slow-motion, slowly falling to the cold pavement, but I don't know when it will finally make contact.

In the meantime, I'm existing, trying to experience new things and connect to people as much as I am able to, but I can't shake the conviction that I'll eventually resolve to leave by my own hand, despite whatever life I've made for myself.

The fight's already been lost, and at some point, I'll have to accept defeat.
