I am okay, until I have to be alone with my thoughts.
I enjoy the company of my friends, even though I'm very bad at talking to them. When I'm out with them or rehearsing with my band I feel okay. I almost feel depression free for the time beingâ€” I feel like everything will be okay, that I got this, that I am in control, that it doesn't matter that I have a lot of homework due in the next week cause I'll go home and get it done. I feel strong and motivated. 

And then I have to go home. I am no longer in the company of people who love me, so I start feeling anxious. I start believing they actually fucking hate me. I lose it. I hate being alone because my horrible thoughts are a lot easier to hear over the silence of no one talking.
