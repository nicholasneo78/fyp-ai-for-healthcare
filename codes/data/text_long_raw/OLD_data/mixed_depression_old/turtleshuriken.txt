Any recommended supplements/vitamins for depression? (Or maybe just tips in general)
Lately, I have been taking Vitamin D and doing some light exercising throughout the week and I have noticed the improvement on my mood.

It might just be a placebo type of thing, but it would be great if any of you guys can recommend more alternatives/habits to do when depressed.

I have depression and I sometimes recognize when Iâ€™m starting to fall into a pit of despair and I try my best to avoid it all costs- it is almost impossible to crawl back out!
