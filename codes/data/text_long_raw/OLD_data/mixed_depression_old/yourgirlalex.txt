Does anyone else miss the person they used to be?
I've always struggled with depression, but sometimes it's more manageable than other times. I've noticed that with every new year and myself getting older, I begin to look back on my past and long for it, even sometimes breaking down because I miss the person I used to be.

I'm 23, so still young, but I really wish I could go back and be 19/20 again because that was when I was truly happy. I had moved out of my hometown, had lots of friends, a good relationship, I lost tons of weight and was confident for the first time ever, I traveled and worked for fun instead of working as a means of survival. I loved life, I had so much energy and such a bright outlook on everything and I had a lot of fun.

Now, that's all over. I really only have one good friend left from those times and he doesn't even live near me anymore; sometimes I get really down when I think about old friends and start thinking about things I could've said differently that might've prevented the arguments we had that would eventually lead to the end of our friendship, I really never knew how much I needed them until they no longer wanted me in their lives. My relationship fizzled out in the same way and I've yet to develop a connection like that with anyone again. I've also gained all my weight back and can't stand to look at my own reflection.

I don't know how to be happy like I was again. I look at old pictures from times past with old friends, destinations I went too and I want to cry because I just wish I could go back. I'm so depressed and hate myself, I'm incredibly lonely and am just a shell of the person I used to be. It's like I'm mourning my past life or something.
