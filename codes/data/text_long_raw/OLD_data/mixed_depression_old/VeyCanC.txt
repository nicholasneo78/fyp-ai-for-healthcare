That eternal slumber
I’m tired.
I’m not here to be saved.
I’m nearly 40: have a career, a SO, friends &amp; family who care for me but it will never be enough to keep me around. 

I’ve been depressed since age 8, my first suicide attempt was at 11 and I’m convinced my life will end by my own hand eventually.

I’ve lurked here but never posted.
I had to reach out somehow and was not going to call or text the goddamn crisis line. 

The world sees me as happy and outgoing even when I’m honest about my depression b/c I don’t SHOW it to anyone. I’m lonely. I’m tired. I’m not sure how much I have left to give. I try. I do. I wake up &amp; try to be positive, make the most of each day but I’m just going through the motions.

That siren’s song has been stronger these past few weeks. Tonite ended with me locked in the bathroom, sitting on the floor in a fat, disgusting, pathetic crying heap - razor blade in hand. One of my cats scratching at the door &amp; me trying to hush her so as not to wake my SO. Through the tears I pathetically sliced away at my inner leg a few times. Been a decade since I’ve cut. No relief.

There’s no point to any of this, no ultimate conclusion. I’m not looking for advice or friendship, I just needed someone out there to know how desperately I long for that final sleep.
