Read this if you want, I just needed to let this out somewhere instead of being bottled up inside me... Today I went out and took my driving test for the first time at age 18, yes...18...and I tried to keep a positive attitude throughout the whole day so I could overcome my nervousness. Anyway I got there and took the test and I failed...miserably...all day long today after that I have just became really depressed because the following things are running through my mind: - Younger kids than me pass everyday, apparently I must be f***ing retarded and worthless... All my friends passed no problem...why can't I? Why am I so stupid... Everyone had so much confidence in me and I've let them all down, I feel like I shouldn't be alive since I'm so worthless... I have only 2 more chances to pass this before I have to fill out some form saying that I'm too f***ing retarded to drive and that I need more help as I'm too stupid to try again myself...so the state has to approve my dumb a** to try again... I feel like I'm not even good enough to do anything if I can't pass some simple f***ing test that everyone else can pass...why am I so dumb? Everyone say "It's so easy!", "It's not difficult, I passed my first time!", it just makes me want to kill myself since I can't live up to the standards of this world...and may other things I just can't find words to describe...I'm not asking anyone to comfort me or make me feel better or anything, I just wanted to let this out...thanks for that...
