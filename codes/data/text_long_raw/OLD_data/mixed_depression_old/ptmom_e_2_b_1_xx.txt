Hi there, I have never posted anything before so I don't know if this will work. Does anyone have that feeling in the back of your throat like you are going to cry? I have it off/on throughout the day sometimes it is so bad I have to really concentrate not to let the tears come. I'm on Effexor xr now and adrrall 2x/day. Sometimes the medicine makes a difference but most of the time not. I have been on a bunch of other medicines but they usually only work for 6months then the feelings of sadness come back again. Anyone else had this throat feeling?
