When I'm lying in my bed, I think about life, and I think about death, And neither one particularly appeals to me
Nowhere Fast - The Smiths

This is me in one sentence. Nothing matters. I literally couldn't give a shit if i live or die. What does it matter. We're just a tiny flash on a rock flying through space. We don't mean shit. I don't mean shit. Life doesn't mean JACK FUCKING SHIT. I'm not even sad. I'm just totally numb. Happiness, sadness. Doesn't exist. Love, hate. Doesn't exist. Reason, meaning. Doesn't exist. We waste our short time on this world then we die. That's it. So why should I give a shit either way. I could kill myself right now. Would it change anything? Not really. I could go and get help, Meds and stuff, and I could probably be "happy" if I tried hard enough. Would it change anything? Not really. When nothing has any meaning then why should I do anything? I don't particularly WANT to die. But I see no reason to waste even more effort trying to live. It's a weird situation, but like I said before. I literally couldn't give a shit.
