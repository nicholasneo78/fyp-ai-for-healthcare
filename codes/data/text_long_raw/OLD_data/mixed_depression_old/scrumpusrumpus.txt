can I be fired for going to the hospital again?
I missed 2 months of work and went in FMLA last year for inpatient and then out patient. I'm getting worried that I'll try to kill myself soon and think maybe I should go inpatient to get a few days away from everything and maybe then I won't be as much if a danger to myself and can think more clearly. I'm really worried that if I leave work for a week or two again that I'll be fired. idk what to do. I guess if I don't go I might kill myself then I won't have to worry about work idk
