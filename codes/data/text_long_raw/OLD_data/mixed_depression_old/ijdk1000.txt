Feeling insecure that my friend hates me
I'm really stressing out right now. This happens all the time, I feel like my closest friend hates me. But recently, it's been getting bad. He's been ignoring me in person, taking forever to text back, and being really passive aggressive while texting me.

It really hurts me that he does this, because he knows I have bad mental health, but he only makes me feel worse about it by making me feel worse about myself. This has been happening for the past three months, and I've had so many urges to tell him that we can't be friends anymore because he's hurting me so much.

But I love him to death, when he is around, he supports me. But the moment he stops, he acts like I don't exist. It's tearing me apart. I'm scared to talk to him about it because I don't want him to hate me anymore than I feel like he already does, but I just don't know what to do about it.

I feel so alone without him, and I really need some comforting words, and maybe some advice on what to do.
