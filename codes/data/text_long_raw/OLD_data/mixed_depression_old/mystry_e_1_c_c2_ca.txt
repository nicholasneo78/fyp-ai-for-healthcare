my name here is mystry and on behalf of me, myself and I ... we all would like to say hey ... but I see we already have ... so let's say hello ... duh ... we've said that too ... gosh gall darn it ... I just can't seem to get a word in edge wise ... I guess you've noticed that I hide my fear and pain behind a mask of humor ... but as I write this I am crying like a little baby ... and this baby is a 46 year old ... male ... from Canada ... I hope to find a hiding spot here and maybe some support ... hopefully my years will bring some knowledge to a few here as well ... I guess I will stumble out the way I came in ...
