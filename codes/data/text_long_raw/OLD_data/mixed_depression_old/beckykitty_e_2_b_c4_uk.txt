I'm 29, female and i live in the UK. My background with depression is that i started suffering from it significantly when i was 18 and
have been on various antidepressants since. I've recently come off
Effexor (venlafaxine) after about 5 years of being on it, at mostly
the 150 mg dose, and this has been the only antidepressant that's
properly helped me. Two months ago i decided to come off it, as id
been wanting to at least lower the dose i was taking, for some time.
Also my doctors surgery are now "funnier" about prescribing it to
new patients because of the reports of heart murmurs among some
patients. I've been taking citalopram, at either 20 mg or 40 mg but i
don't really like these medications and after this month is up I'm hoping to
come off them, either to go on something else or to stop taking antidepressants altogether, those are my options. But the truth
is ..... and my doctor is wondering as well .... what medications would i go on
next? I've felt pretty rotten lately and the citalopram has done
little for me except negative stuff, it makes me want to just take
the venlafaxine again!

Any thoughts, comments or suggestions would be most welcome!!
