I myself have suffered Major Depression Disorder for years. I myself got diagnosed in the last year and half with Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate, Severity; Disorder of Written Expression; Reading Disorder; and even Asperger's Disorder. I was diagnosed in 2004. The Doctor and I did many tests. When I got My diagnosed with depression by the doctor I Myself was not surprise by the diagnoses. Though we did not to what I remember did not talk about depression. I knew I have been suffering depression for years that even I could diagnose myself. I myself have been trying to get help for myself for the last five years. I have been on various drugs like Paxil which had made me suicidal in 2000. I got off it though before I did commit suicide I thank God for that. My depression has always made me suicidal at one time or another. Living with depression has made me do things like drinking and such things like that in My Life. With My Depression in My Life has lead Me to find Myself in ways that I am learning from My Depression. I have a cousin that committed suicide 2005 His Life will be missed I know for Myself for He also suffered a Major Depressive Disorder. I sometimes just feel like giving up Myself but have yet found something so I will not give up in the end. I hope I still yet learn something that I do not every give up. I have done this for many years with out any doctors or drugs to help Me. Sometimes I wonder why I am still here living on this Earth. It sometimes has been very hard for Me just like My cousin. I will leave it there
