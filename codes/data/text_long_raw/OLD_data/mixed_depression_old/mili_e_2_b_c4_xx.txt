I am 30 and fighting with my depression for almost 2 years now. I had psychosomatic problems all the time. Until July, I was on medication with SSRI (selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors) which helped me a lot but never completely and then for some months none. Now I consulted another doctor and decided to try with different medicine called Remeron.
But my question might sound not related .... I somehow think that contraceptive pills (antibaby pills) that I used somehow contributed to my "state of art". I used them for 3 months because my gynecologist advised ( she thought that I had some problem with hormones; she did not even check my blood!) and when I stopped with this "therapy" I experienced "total breakdown of the system".
Now, this pills somehow simulate pregnancy, and there is phenomenon of postpartum depression (the baby blues) and the women over 50 quite often develop depressions (hormones again!) ......!!!

So, I would like to ask if somebody had similar experience with contraceptive pills?!
