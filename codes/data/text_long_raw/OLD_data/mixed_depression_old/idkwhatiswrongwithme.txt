I'm 19 and tired of living
I'm writing because I don't have anyone else to talk to in real life that could understand me. I'm a 19 years old girl, close to turning 20, never had a relationship in my life and only kissed a boy once. I've had boys hit one me before but I always turned them down. I feel terrible that I've never dated anyone, but in reality I don't even know what my sexuality is and I don't think that I'd be a good partner to anyone. I feel so miserable and sad all the time. I hate my body and my appearance even though I know that I'm not really ugly. I don't know why my self esteem is so low. I don't have energy anymore do anything in my life. I don't have a lot of friends and the ones that I've had in high school I don't talk much to them. I always end up isolating myself from people and the regretting it later. I don't know why I do this. I don't why I hate myself so much. I just wished that I could love myself. I think I'm depressed but I don't know for sure. I went to a psychologist a while ago and all I could do was cry and tell them how miserable I felt and they basically didn't tell me anything and it felt like a waste of money. Anyway, I don't know what I have, I just know that there's something wrong with me. I feel like I've wasted my teenage years away being socially anxious and not connecting with people, and I don't why I am like this. I just wished that I could socialize and be happy and not care so much about how I look and how others perceive me. The year is coming is to an end and I am just feeling terrible because I'm still lonely and depressed and because I'm not in college yet because I didn't study enough for the entrance exam. Anyway, sorry if my English is bad, I've always lurked in this sub and I wanted to post something to know that I'm not alone.
