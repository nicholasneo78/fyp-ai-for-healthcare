Today is my birthday.
I mostly spent the day alone. I got a few more “happy birthday” messages than expected so that’s nice I guess. Otherwise, it felt like a normal day, though a bit sadder because I feel like I’m expected to be happy but I’m not. From now on, I’m gonna stop hoping my next birthday will be better like I usually do. It’s just disappointing and depressing.
