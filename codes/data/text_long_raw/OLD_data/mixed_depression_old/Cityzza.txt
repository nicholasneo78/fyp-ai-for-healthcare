Difference between antidepressent starting side-effects and hypomania?
Hey all,

So I've read about how SSRIs can send bipolar people who are misdiagnosed with unipolar depression / anxiety into hypomania or mania. I've also read that SSRIs can have activating effects during the start up period (including insomnia, restlessness, distractibility) that sound similar to some of the symptoms of hypomania. 

So if someone starting and SSRI experiences trouble sleeping, restlessness, increased energy, increased distractibility, periods of euphoria, spends money like it's nothing, increased pressure to talk/sing/dance, increased responses to music and caffeine, starting up old hobbies, etc.,  how can they know whether it's a combination of start-up side effects of the SSRI + feeling (much) better from the SSRI (or maybe placebo / excitement from doing something about the depression) or an antidepressant-induced hypomanic episode?

I know it's a question for a professional but I like to hear experiences also.
