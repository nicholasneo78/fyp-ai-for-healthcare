I had a date on Saturday. It went great unfortunately.
I have a friend that I'll call H. I've known her for 2+ years now and I really like her as a person. I recently discovered that she was interested in dating me, which boosted my self confidence so much (because who would be into someone like me). Well a week ago I worked up the courage to ask her out on a date, and this Saturday we went on one. It was great. We went to a small local coffee shop and sat there and just talked for almost 3 hours. It was seriously such a good time. On the way out I asked if she'd like to do it again and she said yes. Awesome!


Later that night I get a text... she doesn't think it will work out in the long run. I ask her why and she says we both have very different plans with our future, she's still getting over another break up, etc... Well that sucks, but I understand. 


I was texting H about it a bit more tonight and this is what I get in reply to how I feel about the whole situation- "i feel like there were so many expectations from others that it was made into something i thought i wanted, but then i realized it wasnâ€™t." That attraction she had to me? It wasn't real. It was all made up because of her friends. And of course it was, because who would be into someone like me?


It hurts so bad. I'm crying while typing this. I feel like such an idiot for believing someone would actually be attracted to me. I'm a fool for believing it and I hate myself for it.


I don't know what to do. I thought maybe it would help posting here or something. I don't know.
