I'm new to the forum and this is the most interesting thread I've found so far. I'm in my mid fifties and have suffered from depression for as long as I can remember. It's got a lot worse lately. I've been an "underachiever" because of it, but now I've slowly lost just about everything. I've been on Prozac, Effexor, etc., and I'm now on Zispin. This latest one makes me sleep a lot. I couldn't get up for work even if I could hold down a job. I've gone from being a successful business man to losing wife, estranging my kids and grand kids, I'm unemployed, out of money and running out of hope. It's time that depression in men was seen as the problem it really is. How many of us are performing so far below what we are intellectually, physically and emotionally capable of? It's not just a personal problem. It's a problem for our families and friends and I believe it robs our society of a lot of valuable people. Here's hoping that there really is a solution out there somewhere.
