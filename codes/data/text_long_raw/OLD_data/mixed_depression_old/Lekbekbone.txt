That orange message-notification...
It makes me happy, wanted, feeling like I belong. I love comments because I feel so alone in all of this. Even if the comment didn't help a lot, I feel like I'm not alone. Oh god I'm so miserable.

EDIT: No its not a cry for attention or likes or upvotes. I sincerely feel good when I see the people of /r/depression commenting on my posts, and I love commenting on theirs. A mutual feeling of belonging...
