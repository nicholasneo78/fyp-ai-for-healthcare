Haven't posted for a while because I've not been feeling too good. I'm becoming desperate and don't know what to do anymore. started taking ssri cipralex 2months ago and it has helped a lot with the anxiety and i thought it was helping my depression at first, but I'm starting to feel more depressed again. I've gained 2 and a half stone which is depressing in itself, but i wouldn't mind if i didn't feel depressed ,i would rather be fat and happy, but I'm just fat. I'm feeling much more suicidal and worrying constantly what is wrong with me. i feel physically unwell too. Don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm taking vitamins and eating protein and carbohydrates and doing everything I'm meant to be doing, apart from exercise, don't have the motivation. just so frightened and don't think things will ever get better, just want to end all the pain. am seeing psychiatrist tomorrow and considering stopping the ssri, but have had terrible withdrawal stopping prozac in the past and am afraid. its like I'm damned if i do and if i don't. if he suggests switching, then what about more side effects, just can't cope with this terrible disease anymore, just want to fall asleep and die.
