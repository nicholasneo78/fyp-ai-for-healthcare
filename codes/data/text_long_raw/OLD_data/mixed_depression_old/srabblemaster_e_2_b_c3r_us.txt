Depression never ends does it?  You take the Paxil or whatever pill they prescribe.  You take it for years and years and every day you still feel so down and lonely and empty inside.   I'm sick of being sick.  I'm tired of being tired.  I don't know for sure if I want to kill myself or not.  I've made several attempts at it but then sometimes I think I don't really want to die I just want this life to get better.  Some people have "normal" lives don't they?  Why do they have normal lives, and what the heck is wrong with me?  Why can't I just snap out of it someday and be someone productive!?!?!   I HATE MYSELF, I hate the way I've made my life.  I want a job that says I matter, I want to rewind and start over knowing what I know now!  RANT RANT RANT - I hate life!
