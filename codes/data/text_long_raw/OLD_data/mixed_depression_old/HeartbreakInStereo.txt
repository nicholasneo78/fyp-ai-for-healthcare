I just love sleeping
Just getting in my covers and wrap myself in a blanket. Everything's dark and my body's resting. I wish I could be there all my life.

 I dream, sometimes, but normally I don't dream. And that's when I'm the happiest. I just feel like I'm dead and have no problems.

Just the ritual of wrapping myself and then getting comfortable is the only thing to make me smile. I then daydream, and in that state where I'm conscious but not enough to acknowledge my problems, I fall asleep.

But then there comes tomorrow, and sometimes I wish I could have stayed awake all night to avoid waking up and facing reality, but then I remember I love sleeping.

Sadly, it's another day and I have to get out of bed.
