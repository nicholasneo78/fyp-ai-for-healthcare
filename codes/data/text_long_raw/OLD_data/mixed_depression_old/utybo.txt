Life can't be enjoyed and is all about stress and anxiety, why should I give a fuck?
I have no friends irl and can't make any because i can't be social for shit, nor do i want to make any effort improving that. Family time is just plain meh and i don't really feel loved, even though i am. I find no enjoyment in anything.

I'm at the end of high school and soon have to decide on what school i want next but i don't want to work in the future, as i would just always feel like shit, be under pressure or whatever

Life is just shit, and I don't see why i should continue
