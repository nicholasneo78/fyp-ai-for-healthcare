 After I followed a link to the "I Love Bees" blog from  urlLink www.penny-arcade.com  I decided it was about time I actually started my own blog. About six months ago I had started an online journal, but at the time I was drowning myself in Smirnoff frequently (daily) and lacked the motivation to sit down and write. I think now I have the time and mind to actually keep up with this.  When signing up for my blog, I could not for the life of me think of a name for it that would be worthy. I stopped right there. If I don't have a decent name for my blog, what's the point? I figured, something would come to me eventually and it did. I saw Garden State last night (Go see it, it's fantastic!) and it gave me the name for my blog. The movie sums up all the thoughts and feelings going through my mind at this moment in life, thus, my Infinite Abyss will be this blog. I hope you enjoy it.
