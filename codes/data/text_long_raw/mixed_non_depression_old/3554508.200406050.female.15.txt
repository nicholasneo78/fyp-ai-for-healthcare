 While I was reading other friends' blogs that I realized to just be myself... I really don't think I've ever done that before, not in the 14-almost 15- years that I've been alive.  It's hard to imagine, I know, but it's true!  Zac's writing awakened me... he showed me, not trying to, how to be myself.  So here it goes:  I like a guy, named Eric and supposebly he likes me back the same way-according to Erin.  I just hope he didn't lie and was telling the truth... I've been hurt and I don't want to be hurt again.  I'll post tomorrow. ~Paranoia
