 Hi, today is my first day with blogger. My life is going pretty good as of right now. I meet this really nice girl. She's every thing I've ever wonted. I'm just haning on and seeing were God is going to take me. This summer I had a chance of a life time by going on a mission trip to Panama in Latin america. I have devoped a much better realtionship with christ. I feel that it was and is a life changing event that has helped me out in so many ways that know one will ever know. I need to go but, God Bless
