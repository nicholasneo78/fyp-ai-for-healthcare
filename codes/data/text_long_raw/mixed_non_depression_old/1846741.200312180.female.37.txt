 Still haven't gotten very far in the planning and execution of the "Get my Life in Order" desire.  I just can't seem to take that next step that will get me where I want to be.  I still weigh the same.  My finances are just as bad.  And getting worse.  I feel drawn to write and to voice over work, but can't bring myself to act on that conviction.  I know what I need to do to make my life work, but am stuck at the same old place.  I want to be the person God created me to be more than anything else.  What do I have to lose right?  I don't like where I am, but it's familar, but I'll never realize my potential if I don't.  HELP!!!!!!!!!!
