These parents physically hurt their teenage daughter by burning her with hot oil and hitting her with broomsticks due to her refusal to marrying a man much older than her who is paying $20,000.
This horrendous story just goes to show that your family isn't always this happy loving caring group of people who want the best for you. Sometimes your family can be toxic and parents can be bad at their jobs, and it's very important to know when to say no, and walk away if you can. Especially if your culture and religion like this young girl tells you to never say no to your parents and obey their commands no matter what, It becomes very hard to go against them and say no, but it is essential to draw that line for your own safety.
