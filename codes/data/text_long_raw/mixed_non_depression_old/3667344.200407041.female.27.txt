 so i'm back from my family vacation and it was alright...i guess the best thing about the whole trip was actually seeing my entire immediate family (divorced parents, my sister and her 2 children, my son and myself) together...family is a blessing and i'm grateful for it...i did get a chance to spend some time on the beach by myself...i'm glad that i called my main home girl who advised me to claim what i needed and that was some time without my son...being on the beach and standing in front of water and talking to god was very refreshing...i asked god to give me clarity with my relationship with "him"  then things got interesting...i got an phone call from "keys" and he expressed to me that it would have been nice if i came to visit him and asked how i would have responded to advances he may have made...after all this time, i really do honor our friendship and would not want to cross any lines that cannot be reversed...plus, i must honor what "he" and i are experiencing now and must give the respect that i ask of him...right?
