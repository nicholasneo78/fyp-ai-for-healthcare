 Back once again.   I'm going to change my eating, work, spending and cleaning habits.    Really.  I am.  I've been working at making God the center of my life more the past week and it seems to have helped.  I don't want to be this way anymore.  But I don't want to lose what I like.    I shut down and I don't like that.  I don't want to avoid or delay, but there are some things I don't have a solution for, so I don't know how to face them.    Anyway.   Took my measurements and weighed in today.  Height:   245 pounds Chest:     57.5 inches Waist:     49 inches Hips:       57 inches  I want to take care of myself.  I need to take care of myself.  I just don't think I know how.
