 I haven't felt well for a few days and I am beginning to feel better.. I don't know why, but I haven't been sick for a long time. - Weird.. but I felt sick this week.. but never threw up or anything.. just felt like shit!      School is comming very fast and I hate it. There was barely any summer whatsoever.. it was like never hott. And along with school comes soccer season.. which means lots of running and exercise.. I better get practicing.. ugh. I also was supposed to read this summer, this was supposed to happen while i was tanning - I tanned twice.  Pages for reading contract - 0     It sucks but its the truth..  I'm going to Hampton Beach with the fam. soon - what fun.. - Hopefully, I will get  some  reading and running done while I'm there.. 'cause I know I'm not gunna get any done when i get home.. well maybe a little but im not wasting the little bit of summer I have left on that shit.       Anyway.. I should get reading. My first book.. I laugh at myself.. haa
