Toddler learning videos on youtube.
Sometimes, we take long commutes in the car with our toddler. Especially, when one parent is driving we let the little one watch videos on the iPad as to not become a distraction for the driving parent. We got one of those iPad holders for the neck support. Now I'm on the search for good toddler learning videos.

We have some good ones in our native language, but we need some in English as well. I'd really appreciate if you linked some of your best toddler videos for one year olds. A big thank you!
