 Did you ever wonder why people care so much? or why anyone shows emotion? emotion is pain and happiness all in the same body emotions overwhelm people so much sometimes it seems unbearable. But then again its not like we can control what we feel. why do people get so angry if someone crys, its neither of there faults because they cant control there emotions. Today my little brother was playing with my feet and it irritates me so much and he just kept on asking me why. i have no idea why thats just how i feel, i dont like it. Can you explain why you feel the way you do about things?
