I don't care about my stepchild.
Okay. 
So I've been married for about 9 months or so. My wife had a kid from someone previously before me. He is two and a half now. I've never cared about him and don't give a shit about him. I know it's not right to say but it's how I feel. I've put up with it the past 2 years because I knew it was the right thing to do for her. We want to have a baby. I want to have a child now of my own but I'm afraid that I will never care for him whatsoever and will care and love my child and never care or love him. I don't know what to do anymore. Me and my wife have never had problems in our relationship or even an arguement. It's not her or us it's me personally. I hate the feeling of not caring. I'm trying to find a solution that doesn't end up with me leaving. But what do you do when you don't care about your step child? I need a solution to this fucked it problem. I care about her. Just
Not about him.
