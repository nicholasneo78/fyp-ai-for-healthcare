 You've gotta wonder whether anyone really trusts the government... I mean, who would trust a bunch of guys who have thousands of dollars each in superannuation, but no money to spend on health?  Who reckoned this war thing was a good idea, anyway?  I mean, brainstorm the word WAR...  Bombs, Guns, Bombers, Fighter Jets, Warships, Soldiers, Politics, Religion, Pillaging, Hate, Pain, Theft, Loss, Killing, Murder, Rape, Death, Destruction  Does anyone see anything happy about that list? (N.B. If your answer was yes, seek professional help.)
