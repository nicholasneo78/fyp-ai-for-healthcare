 Howdy everyone,     I guess I have to find a way to write in this a bit more and keep things up to date however that is somthing I am not always good about. Now that summer is here maybe if there is any exciting news I will post some info and see what is going on in my life.    So now that school is done and I have one course down and I have been to Burlington and back I now enter July.  THe month of unchartered waters. Who knows what this month will bring for me.  I am sure I will have many adventures but at the same time I am sure I will be busy with all the free time I have to deal with.  Today I finished one of my first summer craft projects. I redid my fun chair.  Oh it was so much fun and now I have a very nice light green sponge painted chair.  I think I should just go into home decorating and photography.  I guess maybe if nothing else I will use this as a gauge of what I get done this summer.  Well I hope to get my puzzel I got started and done. I am working on ideas for my classroom. I get to work on bulletin board and decorating ideas. Oh the fun that is present in a summer off.    The 4th of July is here.. I think back to the two times I have not been in the US to celebrate the 4th. One year I was in Paris France at the Hard Rock Cafe and then 2nd time was this last year when I went to Australia for the Summer.  The 4th was the last day we spent in Port Douglass. We went out to Hog's Breath Cafe and had a blast with the bus driver.  OH the memories of July 4th past.  I also recall the year I went to my friends house and we had a hudge water fight and I got water dumped over my head.. Yeah many memories and I am sure more to be created yet this year.  Till next time keep on blogging and Happy 4th!  Cheers!
