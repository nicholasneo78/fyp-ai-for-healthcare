I need advice : what was the moment that proved and showed you that you did or didn't want kids?
I'm trying to find out if I myself would one day want kids of my own. I am a female in my early 20ties and as of now the answer is no, I don't see myself having or wanting kids now or anytime in the near future. However there's still the far future; I want to know if people have a change of heart about this ? Will I stay with the oppinion I have now forever ? I'm not asking to be convinced of being a parent because I don't see having kids or not having kids as a right or wrong. I simply want to be able to find out if I will also not want any in the distant future.
