 Paul, Riley and I had a nice weekend. Yesterday we went up to Bellevue to see Corey and Dan's new place. It is a big condo in the Renton Highlands. Her parents were over this way so we all went down to the Bellevue Arts and Crafts fair.   While there I completely mastered the art of breastfeeding Riley while walking with her in the sling. I love it! I don't even think anyone really knew what I was doing. Corey's dad even asked if she was sleeping.  So cool! I do need a new sling though. I think I am going to make one myself.   Today we all went to church. It was our seminarian, Kahn's, last day. So we went downstairs for doughnuts after mass. Then we came home and Riley was asleep so we did some marathon cleaning.   Robbin stopped by to say hi and reminded me of the heart fabric that she made Riley's curtains out of. (she gave me the excess). So I made Riley some cute pants. They are a little big and long now but she has a lot of room to grow into them.
