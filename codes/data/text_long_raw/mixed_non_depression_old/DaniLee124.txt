How do I help my granny?
She is confined to a chair most of her day. She used to love to do arts and crafts, but now suffers from arthritis. I have considered buying large print mysteries, but not knowing how a story ends makes her nervous. She tends to spend her days in the living room watching House Hunters or reruns of her favorite "good, clean" murders (JAG, Hawaii Five-O, NCIS). She refuses to try new things, or will try only to abandon the idea a few days or weeks later. She claims she doesn't want to sit and rot, but that's what she's doing. Please help with any ideas.
