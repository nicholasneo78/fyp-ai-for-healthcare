I hate my mum
I dislike my mum. In fact, I’m disgusted with her and feel rage sometimes. She acts fake towards me, meanwhile behind my back, she complains and gossips about me. She hates when I talk to my dad at all because she thinks we’re rivalling against her which isn’t true. When I confront her with things she’s said, she says, ‘I never said that. Stop pinning me down. You’re lying. I never lie. I’m perfect.’ And she is religious. This one year I asked if I could see a therapist and she refused until I told her my reasons which she was the reason mainly. Then I told her something else and then she would deliberately ignore me and get mad every time I’d ask again. Until like, 1 year went by and she said I have to have a therapist who is the same religion which I’m not even. She went psycho this one year and yelled, slapped my older sister, threw plates at all of us until we’d run outside to our backyard. And I’ve tried being honest with her. I told her I had some serious trouble at school with bullying and she knew who it was and said to me, ‘they’re always nice to me. I don’t believe you.’ And she never talks with me about how I’m doing or even made dinner when I was younger so I’m still underweight. And she gets mad at every honest thing I say because I’m just kinda frank. My oldest sister has rebelled against her and stuff but yet, she still is a heartless person. And when I’m away from ‘home’ she won’t ever text or call me and then when I return ‘home’ she’ll yell at me and accuse and manipulate me. She’ll say, ‘is it really that hard to send a text?!’ Meanwhile she never does. And she manipulated my dad and ever since I was 7, she’s wanted to divorce my dad and it’s sad because my family is so split, all my dad wants is to just have dinner as a family but that’s too hard. And my ‘mum’ blames my dad for the split of the family. I hate my mum, don’t care about my older sister, but I like my oldest and younger sister and my dad.
