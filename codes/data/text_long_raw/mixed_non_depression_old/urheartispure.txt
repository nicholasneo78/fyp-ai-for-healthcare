feels like everything's falling apart
I gave up my place in halls of residence for this year to take a room in a horrible house with my friends, now they've all fallen out with each other, although they have "sorted things out" things are still pretty tense and two of them are going to move out of the house, this leaves me in the middle, worried about bills, worried about my degree, feeling like everything is falling apart, i feel so stupid, I feel like I should of just stayed in halls. my mental health can't take this.
