Friends don't seem to want to do anything unless I do all the work?
I've been running into this problem a lot lately. If I don't pull all the weight around my friends, nothing happens. 

Admittedly these are, yes, all online friends. I don't really have "Realside" friends any more. It's complicated.

What I mean is- if I don't start a conversation, there will be no conversation. If there's a lull in the conversation, I've got to fill it or the conversation ends there. If I make plans with my friends (Usually to play a game, watch a movie, something like that) there's a 90% chance they'll forget, or just lose interest, or ignore it. And a 10% chance they'll halfass it when it happens. 

What the hell am I doing wrong? I can't be sparklingly, Vegas-Light-Display interesting 24-7, it's fucking exhausting. But if I'm not, I'm alone.
