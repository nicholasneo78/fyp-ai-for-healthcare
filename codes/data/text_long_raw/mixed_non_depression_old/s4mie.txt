bad friend
I’ve been friends with this guy for a few months now. At first things were really great and he was a really good friend, but the past two months he’s been a major DICK. I’ve been keeping my distance and not really talking to him as much. I have 3 weeks to either fix this failing friendship or get rid of it. I’ve decided that if it doesn’t get better in the next week, i will spend the following week trying to get rid of this friendship, and the third week dealing with the aftermath. I just don’t know how to, if i need to, end this friendship without being a major dick in return. He’s friends with a lot of people in my friend “network” perse and is even dating one of my best friends, so i want to leave him on good terms as to not cause any problems. advice?
