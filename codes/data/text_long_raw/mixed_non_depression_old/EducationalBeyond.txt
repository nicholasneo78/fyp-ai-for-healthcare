Religious difference between you and your child?
Hi everyone! I am a doctoral student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and am conducting a research study on the experience of religious difference between parents and children. This experience is one that can be challenging and I hope to understand how parents make sense of it and ideally wish they could communicate about it. 

Participation will take approximately 30 minutes. If you are interested you can access the online survey at this link: https://ssp.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9GIVZe29RWXXe0l

There is minimal risk of emotional and/or psychological discomfort because the survey will ask you questions about your religious difference with your child. You may leave the survey at any time if you do not wish to complete it. 

If you have any questions, please let me know. You may reach me at toni.morgan@huskers.unl.edu. Thank you for your time!
