 Jesus.  Great bloke. Great head of hair.   I'm issuing a challange to everyone. To guys lucky enough to be blessed with long locks. To girls looking for something classic yet bold on their ball nights. Print out the following image of Jesus Christ and present it to your hairdresser. Ask them for "The Jesus". If they're a decent stylist they'll know what to do.  Why is Jesus' hair so underrated? Check out that colour. So... brown. And the volume! My god. Don't even get me started on the parting.  On second thoughts, I can't be bothered posting the image. You all know what Jesus looks like. And if you don't, consult your bible.
