Housemate/friend won’t come out of her bedroom and is pregnant
So my boyfriend and I moved in with our friend and her bf. We all had this idea of living together, hanging out, have dinner get togethers with our other friends &amp; board game nights etc.. it was all great and exciting but then at day 1 after the move, our friend and her bf just kept to themselves, in their room and hardly hangs out with us. Issues came up with them not helping out with the household chores and when my bf and I brought it up, they got defensive. Then our friend informed us that she is pregnant which changes the dynamics in the house even more as they now plan to get out of our shared lease early. That leaves us to figure out how to pay for the remaining months and look for a replacement. That’s fine, it’s their decision to have the baby. But then immediately after that announcement  my friend just literally stopped talking to us, she won’t leave her room, and she would have her bf bring food to her room. In a rare occasion that she comes home while we’re in the living room , she doesn’t say hi or talk to us. I am really confused and hurt because I feel like I’ve lost a friend that I used to know. Now, it’s been a few months since I talked to her. She’s there in the other room behind a wall and it hurts that this is how we have to live. I honestly don’t know what to do.
