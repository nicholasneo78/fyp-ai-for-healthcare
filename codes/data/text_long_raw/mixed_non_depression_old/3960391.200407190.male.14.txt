 Wow, only uno more day at school, which is double geography (don't do anything anyway), double english (don't do anything anway), french (I personally don't do anything anyway), RE (don't do anything anyway) and games (meh...softball).   So not really a day at all! Yay!       Intresting incident walking to the stop de bus avec le Sharon - I swung my PE kit at her head. Now if she was normal, it would've flown over her head, and she would've just been scared of being hit in the head. Whereas Sharon, not being normal, held her phone in the way. So it pinged into the road! Ah-hah. Well, it was really funny at the time. Then I bought a lighter, and I made the flame big(ish), only it wouldn't go out, and scared my thumb.       Then saw Will. Exploded the lighter. Saw the retards that work in Budgens. Hehe. It's the law - only retards are allowed to work in Budgens.       Downloaded  Loverman  again, I lost my original copy of  Garage Inc 2 . Very amusing lyrics - well...odd anyhoo.  urlLink http://www.lyricsondemand.com/m/metallicalyrics/lovermanlyrics.html#  there...amuse yourself.
