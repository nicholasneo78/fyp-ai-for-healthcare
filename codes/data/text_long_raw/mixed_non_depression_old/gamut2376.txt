Brother rage attack my grandmother
My brother is prone to rage attacks. Him and I had that classic "brother love" growing up. Anyways this isn't about me it's about my grandmother. 

So my grandma from my mom's side came from out of the country to live with us for a couple months (my brother and I still live with our mom). To help with housework and see our family. 

She is the one of the sweetest ladies out there. Typical caring loving person, very sensitive and full of love &amp; happiness. Now my brother comes into the equation... he's had his rage bursts with me  and I've learned to deal with it as well as my mother. They say how you treat your mom is how you treat your wife. 
Honestly, he's so disrespectful to my mom at times it makes me vehement. What can I do come in and save the day (when I have done in the past it only made things worse). 

Anyways, I thought I knew my brother well and knew he wouldn't dare yell at my grandma. OMG boy was I wrong he crossed that line. A rage attack came at my grandma with yelling and this time I did intervene. 

After things settled I consoled my grandma she was shocked, sad, unable to believe he was like this. So I told her the truth he has always been like this and I feel just as much pain as she felt becuase seeing her distraught was one of the most depressing things I have ever witnessed. She wants to leave and go back although I can tell she is worried for me &amp; my mom. 

Hate to break the news baba but ya he's a fucking entitled narcisstic pieces of shit on the planet. I understand when guys  blow steam with other guys but seriously to your own mother and grandmother. I think it's completely unacceptable and disrespectful. 

Note: our dad is not involved because he doesnt live with us or see us often

I left a lot of details however, you understand the picture. 


Question: He will not change, I think as a family we should distance ourselves from him carefully. Yes or No?
