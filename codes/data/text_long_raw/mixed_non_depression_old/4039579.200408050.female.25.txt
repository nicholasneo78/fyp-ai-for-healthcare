 I’ve started attending this yoga class at the Fitness Center on Wednesday nights. I figured it would be a good way to gain more flexibility & strength. I have to admit, it’s a lot harder than I anticipated and that kinda pisses me off! Here I thought it would be a nice “break” from my regular workout routine in the middle of the week. I'm pretty flexible and since it’s not straight-up cardio, I assumed it would be easy.  Not so much. It’s actually pretty challenging to continually switch  ; hold all of those poses. And it turns out I’m not as flexible as I thought I was. I’m particularly horrible at the balancing portion of the class. I look like I stopped off somewhere for happy hour before showing up. However, I do enjoy the challenge so I plan to keep going. I just know it will take some time before I feel any sort of euphoria from it.
