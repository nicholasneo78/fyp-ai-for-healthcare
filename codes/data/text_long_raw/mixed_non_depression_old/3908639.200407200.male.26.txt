 Ok, so it's like 4 in the morning and I've laid in bed for 2 hours trying to go to sleep and it's just not working.  I decided to cruise some blogs and then thought oh yeah, I have that one I should work on. I've been thinking way too much tonight, probably why I can't sleep. Anyway to the point, reading blogs I began to think man there are some really damaged people out there. I wonder am I one of them..........do you ever realize, come to an ephipany, hey I'm a really screwed up person........or do you just think everyone else is and you're normal?
