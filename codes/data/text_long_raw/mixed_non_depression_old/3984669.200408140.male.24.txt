 Here I am trying to download anime all night in this government computer. Somehow I end up losing 4 download that night. These computer is slow and it takes like an hour each. You know how much time jts wasted trying to fix this problem. The whole time I was thinking only if I have my own computers. While I am mad at these computer something horrorable was happening out side the camp. 20 mile south of here is the town of Najaf. Those crazy people was acting up all week, threaten to blow up oil line and stuff. So the US marine when down their and kill 300 militia. They got us here alerted of possible counter attack. The trouble they case us just made me want to go down their to joint the fight. I just hate wearing body armor to walk around the camp.
