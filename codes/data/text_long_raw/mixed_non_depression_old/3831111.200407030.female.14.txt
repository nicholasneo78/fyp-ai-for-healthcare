 now im different! i mean, im not one of those "xanga" people...i dont dislike xanga, but i just dont like it...im not sure why, but probably cos all my friends have a blog from xanga. and i think its kind of weird... sorry if you are using xanga, dude  well well well, i hope cc (my gooody friend) is doing a good job. Kelpie (another nicccce friend) is leaving soon and there is gonna be a good bye party for her, which is supposed to be a big surprise...but cc already told me that things went wrong from the start...well, good luck guys! im here in japan, and im nothing to do with the party...lol (well i am, cos i was part of the planning, but i cant go anyways)  aww i miss my cat...hes so cute, so cute, and so cute. i can eat him. i mean i cant but i want...no, i dont want to, but if i try i can. sorry i dont make sence. but thats how awfully cute he is...  noow i have to spend my money....for kelpie :) since i cant come to the party, im gonna buy lots of nice things, may be lots of CHEAP things so i can buy even more, and give them to her when im back in europe. but the problem is that im not really allowed to go out alone...and my bike doesnt come off the stupid chain...so its not really possible to go in town and spend the nice money...  -------------i think its enough. so. okay. bye bye
