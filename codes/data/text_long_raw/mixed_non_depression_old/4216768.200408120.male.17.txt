 I'm mentally preparing myself for my journy into Western Psyche. I told myself that Monday, one week from the last time I went, I would return.  So I now wonder what this will be like now.  Seeing her again.  I did blow her off. But I have just given myself the time I needed to get my mind back in order. This one week crawled by.  Seemed like an eternity.  I woke up this morning.  A gagging noise, then a forced heave as I stared blankly at the ceiling.  Too scared to move.  Then a surryingoff and the patter of  little kitten feet.  I knew that my cat threw up on my damn bed. I slid my feet up, and boldly looked down.  Yes indeed, but not just a small pile, a stream across the whole quilt.  At least four feet long.  That was it.  I just got up. 6:30 AM.  Went downstairs and watched All in the Family recordings.  Damn funny show at times.    I am falling deeper and deeper in love with Sarah Vowell.  I learned a few days ago that she is an Athiest.  She is a Democrat.  She is my oasis in this world of unlogical happenings. She is so beautiful. I will marry her someday, I know it in the deepest parts of my soul. The sticky parts.
