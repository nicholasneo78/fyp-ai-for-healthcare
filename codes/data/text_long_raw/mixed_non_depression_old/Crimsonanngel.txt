My bio dad died and his family didnt tell me until 3 days later...
Him and I were never very close. Probably an understatement considering our only interactions were him calling drunk and calling me dirty names since the age of 14. I believe it started at 14 because I had sent him a letter wanting to have a relationship with him. I just wanted to know my dad even if it wasn't a super close relationship I still wanted one. Well fast forward 6 years later he's in the hospital for nearly a month and no one tells me, not even his sister who I am in contact daily with. Finally he passes away last thursday. He was intubated and couldn't speak for most of his hospital stay. He was 39. I asked his side of the family why nobody told me he was in the hospital or why nobody told me died the day it happened. Their reasoning? I had vented at a few points saying I wished he was dead (normally after he would call me drunk and call me a whore and talk shit on my mother who raised me since birth). I am also not invited to the service. Should I feel duped? Should I feel cheated out of a chance to say goodbye even though we weren't on the best of terms? Because his family and girlfriend sure as hell made it clear i don't even deserve to grieve. All i wanted was a relationship with him and all I got was name calling and him taking me and my mom told court over the $200 he had to pay in child support each month. I wasn't very nice to him, I tried to be.. But he made it so hard. So was it  really they're call to say I couldn't see him. Or am I right to feel this way..
