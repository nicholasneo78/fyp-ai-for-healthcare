Friends?
Hi Reddit, so I recently moved to a new town (and by recently I mean about a year ago) and everything has been alright but I have a really hard time making friends. I'm pretty awkward and I'm just naturally awkward around everyone. 

I managed to get a best-friend, but its more like he adopted me to be his friend and I got the balls to get a girlfriend who I've been with for about 10 months now. I even got somewhat of a friend group but I'm always awkward around any of them when I'm just with them. 

so, what i'm trying to say I guess is that I'm wondering if ya'll could give me advice on how not to be awkward or how to get people to enjoy/embrace my awkwardness. I don't know man, I just want friends lol. Thanks guys &lt;3
