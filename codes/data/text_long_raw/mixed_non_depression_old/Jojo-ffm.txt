My mom caught me with someone, I lied and now she is mad...
tl;dr: Mom caught me with someone and also caught me in a big lie.

My mom (F54) caught me in a huge lie as well after that, because I was trying to get her out of the house, things have been complicated since I've been lying.

Today she arrived sooner than expected and well what i was trying to avoid happened. She is telling me I'm like a 14 year old and doesn't understand why i've done this. That I don't do shit despite me doing house stuff, and working. That "I was your age too" conversation happened.

I'm 22 years old and I'm thinking about moving out and doing my own thing, but I feel like I don't need to update people every 10 minutes, is that just me?

I don't think I have been lying to her, I just didn't told her I was seeing someone, and to be honest what was she expecting me to say??

To be honest I don't know what to do, can you guys help me dealing with this?? I kinda feel worthless at this point too because of all the things she said to me
