So guys, I have a dilemma. My best friend and I watched greys anatomy together up until this new season. We laughed together, we cried together, we bonded. We were obsessed. Well come to my surprise, she just chose to stop watching. Like just like that. My mom says to not be friends with her because I don't need that kind of negativity in my life but we've been best friends for 8 years. I'm really stuck between a rock and a hard spot. I loved what we had for greys but it's just not the same anymore. How should I proceed. Need advice
