Why did my sister commit suicide on October 28th, 2017, three months ago today?
She was beautiful.  She was successful in business.  She gave the ultimate wisdom and advice.  She knew what love was.  She traveled the globe.  She gave back.  She was selfless.  Why did she do it?  How was she able to jump from so high up?
