 Well here it is June 30 and I'm sitting at work surfing the net trying to get things situated as I set out on my journey. I have spent the last month selling, buying and donating things so that I can be well prepared for my journey abroad. I have been checking my mail box day in and day out looking for my arrete de nom from the academie of CRÃ‰TEIL so that I can hurry down to the Embassy to get my visa and all that jazz, but I wait patiently because each day my mail box is empty. I'm apparently very bored at work because I have time to create this blog, but it's nice to spend your last months doing things that you enjoy besides working. For now, I'll go and try to be productive at work and I'll be back soon!  Sam
