my cousin
Long story short, I have an 8 year old cousin and I don't like him. I'm 19 going on 20 by the way. My mom babysat him when he was a newborn till when he was about 2. I always felt kind of jealous because my mom completely forgot about my dad and I when she babysat him but I always kind of understood that she wasn't doing it intentionally because kids are so high maintenance at that age. Anyways, fast forward to my teen years and his young kid years and I can't stand the kid. He's such a crybaby even for his age and he doesn't like me for some reason. It started because he was taking toys from my dog and my dog started crying, so I yelled at the kid and he started to cry. I don't think I was being over the top and the kid definitely had to have someone discipline him. My mom loves him a lot and always talks about him but it pisses me off because it seems like she cares about him and his dad more than her own husband and only son. The kid does nothing but play video games on his xbox or my mom's iPad when he stays with us, Which I failed to mention is a very common occurrence. I'm starting to ramble but the main goal of this post was to find out if anyone feels the same way about any of their younger family members or if I'm just a complete asshole.
