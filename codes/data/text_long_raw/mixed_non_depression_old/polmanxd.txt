I want to convince my family to repair my phone instead of buying a new
The phone is okay but recently the touchscreen didnÂ´t work , and i want to recycle using it more time by repairing instead of buying a new one and throw the old one.  Its not a super priced phone , but i feel bad thinking how many people throw things because there have a broken element and instead of repairing they buy a new one .
I fucking hate trhowing the things that are okay but need a little fix.

P.d= Sorry for the bad words
