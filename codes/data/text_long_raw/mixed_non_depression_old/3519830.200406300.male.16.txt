 If you want my life you can have it...   Hey everyone its Chris Here once again... I haven't written in this a lot, but here it is. Um Well I am not going out with Victoria anymore, and a lot has happend. Well I am out of school finally and I am not grounded. I feel really happy right now... I feel important.. Never really felt that way before. My new girlfriend Georgia has made me really happy inside, ya know? She makes me feel like I actually am important and thats a great feeling. My ex-girlfriend got really mad cause I was friends with girls, and cheated on me. Eh it was really dumb, and it was a friend of mine. And then she dumped me and said I could go out with anyone I would want, so I went out with Georgia. It felt like 9 months went down the drain and all that stuff. But finally yesturday she said she was sorry and "demanded" me to take her back. I told her I didn't wanna deal with it and move on with my own life, but I would like to be a good friend still. She got really angry and hung up the phone. Today She called me back and said she was sorry, then I told her I respect everything she says and all of her desicions. Since we broke up though I didnt really like the fact that she was trying to get me jealous by saying she is a whore by doing stuff with about literally 8 guys and going out with another... the same guy she cheated on me with. Its cool though We all take bumpy rides on the coaster of life, but we will come back. What one said before... What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger. I have become more self-dependant.. I feel more happy about it also and shit wont put me down as much... Other then that, The new Slipknot CD is awesome.
