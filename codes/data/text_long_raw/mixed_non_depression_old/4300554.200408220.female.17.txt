 I've been here in the computer for like 3 hours and... I don't want to do my homework!!! *whines*  It's a perfect day, cool, lots of breeze, perfect to sleep, not to do homework!  Are teachers stupid or what?  So yeah, sunday, a good day, I'm here in the computer avoiding homework, listening to NOFX, just made some art for my room and my family was like "O.o you drew that?" lol... I hope it's not in a bad sense, like "oohh, I thought you could draw... and now you draw THAT? THAT?" lol  So,yep, I'm alone, but I'm happy.  I'll stop worrying about the fact that I don't have  a date or anything tonight. After all, in this moment I don't like anybody, and nobody likes me... what can I do.   For those who are good enough to get dates on the weekends, awesome.  But I'll stop feeling bad because of it.   I won't suffer, at least not today.... because, why all lifes have to be that way?, you're little, you play with dolls.  You grow up and Wow! it's time to date! If you don't you're a loser!, I know that's how evolution has made us, our ancient instinct of reproduction living in the lymbic system, that's a primitive system! That's why I have a cortex, I don't have to follow those rules (damn, all this talk made me remember my homework...)... Yeah, I know what you all are thinking... "Loser"...haha  but I won't suffer... no, I won't. I won't I won't....  *sigh*  I won't.... really.
