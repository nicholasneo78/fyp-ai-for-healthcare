 why the hell can't I get a damn doctor or dentist appointment withing this century.  Is there this much of a shortage of doctors.  I have serious problems here (but not enough of an emergency to call an ambulance) and nobody can see me because they are all booked till november or some crap.    Now that I got that out... first entry in this log just so happened to be after calling multiple doctors and dentists to find that we seem to have a shortage of them.  Well, I gotta get back to work now... setting up this blog was my waiting on hold task... time for some real work.
