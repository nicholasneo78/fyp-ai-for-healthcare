Sister dislikes me.
So me and my sister barely speak and barely see each other, but today just made it clear how much she dislikes me. She spoke to everyone but me, I could even see her giving her fianc√© looks every time I spoke- I suffer from chronic depression and anxiety so when I tried to speak to my family in the room she would speak over me about something else to that same person I was speaking to. You see, I had an abortion just months before she became pregnant and ever since then she has been off with me. She gives me looks every time I go near her son or even when I attempt to smile at her. I just don't even know anymore. Her son is 2 just to give you a reference of how long it's been. We was fine during my process of going through the abortion but now she just doesn't care to try.
