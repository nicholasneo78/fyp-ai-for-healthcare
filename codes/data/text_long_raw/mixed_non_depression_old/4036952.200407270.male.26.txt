 my wife just walked in and placed a big bag of pistachios on the table next to me... they are nice. I usually buy a handful when I go to play adnd with the guys, playing adnd is nice.. no actually it's awesome fun, very geeky, but hell what do I care! What matters more in the world than enjoying yourself with good friends? not much, that I can assure you.
