 This is my first entry, and I must say, this site looks MUCH better than livejournal.  For those of you who are reading this, my name is Meghan, and I am addicted to caffiene, video games and the internet.  Some of the sites I like to go to are:Gaia(my sn is Abbi Normal if you want to contact me), Kingdom of Loathing(Ilove that RPG), and The Best Page in the Universe(Maddox is god).  Not much is happening in my life at this moment, with summer vacation and all.  Ok, that was a lie...I'M GOING TO DISNEYLAND NEXT WEEEK! I'm so fucking excited.....   .....I've nothing else to add today.
