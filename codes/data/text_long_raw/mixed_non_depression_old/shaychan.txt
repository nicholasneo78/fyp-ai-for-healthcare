not invited to friends party, yet others who barely know her were?
so, i wasn't invited to my close friend's party, yet i've known her for 3-4 years. countless people who don't talk to her were invited and so she can't use the excuse of that she had 'limited room/invitations.' also she mentioned to one of my friends, who was invited, that she had sent me an invitation (via text) yet I didn't respond. when it seems as if the text didn't 'go through.' but the fishy thing is that she even made a groupchat. how could a text not go through and how could she forget to add me to a groupchat? 
I'm just upset and I'm not sure what I did wrong.
I don't want to confront her because either she'll get upset, or she'll just say 'it was a mistake.' yet somehow i don't believe it was and I want to know what I did wrong.
