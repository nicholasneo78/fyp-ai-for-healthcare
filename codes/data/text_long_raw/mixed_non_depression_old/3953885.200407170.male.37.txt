 Awoke this morning to a text message from Rob, obviously sent before he went on his way to Alton Towers.  Decided not to get up straightaway though, a mistake in itself as when I did get up I'd got a raging headache!  Managed to get my car cleaned and dried just as it started to rain, ah well...at least it's looking better than it was.  Btw, the text is a little bit too risque to publish on here, but it referred to the frolics of yesterday afternoon. *blushes*     Got someone else coming to see the house later this afternoon...a first-time lady buyer apparently.  Seems like the influx of Londoners coming into the sticks hasn't ceased as this is the fourth so far.  I just find it weird really that there have been "so many" of them...mustn't complain though if they're interested in buying the place.     Found out today that Helen is changing her car next week from the Corsa to a People Carrier type vehicle.  Not sure what it is as yet, but I'll get to see it sooner or later!     Dad is still in a mood over something or other.  Does my head in.
