 I don't entirely know why I've changed 'blogs'. I used to be at diaryland.com but decided to change, as things are starting afresh.   The summer's here. Gah. Lots of thoughts swirling in my head. Waiting for other friends to officially finish their colleges etc so that the summer can commence  big time . Well, almost, I hope.   After the summer I start life in performing arts school. I'll be studying Theatre and most likely English Literature. There is no way on earth I thought I'd be sat here a year ago, winning a place in Britain's only free performing arts school. Strange. This will probably become home to future posts in the summer, and when I start school.   Things are about to change.
