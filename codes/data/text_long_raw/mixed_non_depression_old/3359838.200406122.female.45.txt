 The new kittens are doing great! They are over their bout of Calisivirus and are tearing through the house. Exploring every corner, every piece of furniture, every other cat or dog, and of course any plate, cup or glass they can get their paws on, head in. Kittens are such fun. Why don't you go out and adopt one or two today?
