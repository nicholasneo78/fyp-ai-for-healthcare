 Hey I am Casie and I am 15 years old, a sophmore in High School. I go to church at FBC in Harrisburg where I live and have been living for 5 years. I am a nice person I think, or well I try to be sometimes it just doesn't work out. I am a very quiet person until I feel I know you and then I will talk your ear off. I live with both my parents and My little brother Ethan who is 9 years old and in the 4th grade. I love music and basically listen to anything I have handy but I really love the punk rock emo stuff. My favorite bands are Dashboard Confessional and All American Rejects and my favorite song at the moment is "Memory" by Sugarcult. I love writing that is one of my biggest passions besides photography. I am basically a fun loving person.      And without my friends I would be no where... I know I can depend on them to be there for me and they know I will be there for them. Some of them are:      Melody you are my twin sister seperated at birth and my bad influense     Hannah, Bitch number 2 (I am number 1)     Jenn, my cousin and advisor     Tristyn, big sister     Molly, pollywog ( i really think we lead parallel lives)     Shawna, such a quiet person but really a big goof ball     Sam J you're sweet, crazy at times but awesome     Rachael you're there for me all the time      Aaron you are somone i never met but i feel like I have known you forever.     Blake you are someone who can make me smile when the world is coming down around me, you're so mean tho especially in those truth or truth games :P
