 ahhh, finally I've got a day off today from the joke I spend 60 hours a week at called work. I'm in the process of sending out resumes...again...  I really hate that I can't seem to find anything more than a dead end job. Finding a career isn't what I want either...but I need something that pays well enough for me to be able to live. Maybe I should just join a band that needs a good guitarist and cash in...but the problem is I like a lot of what's out there, but I certaniy don't want to play it...lol. It's too much like selling your soul to me.   I'm so stuborn...but it's got to happen on my terms in order for me to be able to live with myself...lol. It helps though that I'm going ahead in the right direction, even if it feels like it's taking forever.  That said, tonight I'm fixed on making some magic happen...I don't even know how yet..all I know is I'm going into the studio and it's going to come through.    Someday it's going to be to a point where I'm going to not be able to justify the waste of time my job is...and I'm going to be consumed by this thing we call music...I just hope by that point I've at least got a band together so I can play it...lol...
