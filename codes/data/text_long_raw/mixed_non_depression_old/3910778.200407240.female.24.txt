 Oh yeah. I forgot that I'm supposed to write in this thing every week. Thanks, Beth for reminding me. Really, I'm just waiting to upgrade it with ghetto bootilicious FX before I unveil it. Beth is supposed to help me with that since she's the blogmaster.  I saw the Bourne Supremecy last night. Ehh. The first one was more dimentional. This one was just pure action, jackson.  And what's up with Michael Jackson having quads?
