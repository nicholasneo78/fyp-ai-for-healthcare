I feel depressed and ashamed of what just happened?
My father died a few years and I’m living with his widow who has also been my stepmother for three years, since I was 16. I came home from a night out with the lads and I will admit that I had been drinking and doing a bit of coke, my stepmother got all in my face calling me a junkie and I pushed her, we then got into a physical altercation and we ended up on the sofa with me on top of her, she spat in my face and I head butted her, she then said “do you like hitting women, does it make you feel like a man, go on why don’t you fuck me if you want to be a man” and she lifted up her dress and I almost went through with it, but I said to her “you disgust me” and I walked off and had a wank in the sink instead. I feel confused, but I also got so turned on, what should I do?
