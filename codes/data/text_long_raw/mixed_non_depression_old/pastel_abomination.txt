Made grandma feel old XD
Setting of this story is morbid but this is my favorite memory with my grammy.

I'm about to turn 22 and this took place back in November of 2017. My family lives all along Western Washington and we don't see each other often, so it was bittersweet to see everyone at my great grandmothers funeral. My cousins and I sat together at one end of the table when we all went to lunch after at a fancy restaurant with our moms next and then grandparents. Only two of us kids are old enough to drink, me and my 28 year old cousin. No one blinked an eye when he ordered an Irish coffee. But then the baby (me) ordered a rum and coke.

This resulted in two things.
1. My mom and cousin laughing at me because my original order was for Southern Comfort and coke and they said I drink  poor people booze (I'm 21 fresh out of college what do you expect)
2. My grandmother nearly had a heart attack when she even heard me utter that I wanted alcohol.

What made this even funnier was when I got my drink and she mentioned to my mom how she keeps forgetting I'm not 16 anymore.
