is my best friend only using me for her problems?
my best friend and i clicked immediately.. however recently any time i have a problem that i need resolved or advice on iy gets pushed to the side. she always blames it on “work” or “school” but when she needs me i drop things for her and drive to wherever she is, regardless of time. what do i do about this? i feel as though my feelings are invalid in this friendship at times. i want to go back to how we were but im terrified of confrontation. please help me
