 Ok everybody. I'm going to admit I'm  not the most unfortunate soul out there. And I feel bad. So I want all of us to start praying for Kellie's friend who just lost everything in a fire.   Psalm 23 A psalm of David. 1 The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.  2 He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters,  3 he restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.  5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.  6 Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.  Wow I love that passage. Later
