My friend is making me extremely uncomfortable lately. Should I remove them from my life?
I’m a teenager and I have a online friend that had been making me uncomfortable lately. She asked me to call her at about 12am because she was afraid of the thunderstorm she heard and when we got on the phone she started flirting with me. I passed it off as playfulness as she has a boyfriend but she continued. She started moaning my name over and over and exposed one of her breasts. When I asked her why she said it was ‘cute how I reacted and funny’. I have no interest in her at all and I expressed this; she apologised over text but I’m still very uncomfortable talking to her. What should I do?
