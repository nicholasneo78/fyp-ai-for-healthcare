 One day this was bound to happen. So it is just as well that it is today May 21st 2004 that I open my very own blog. I hope I will enjoy it, and I hope you may all just as well. Keep your fingers crossed for me and my words. Soon you will know more about me than my email account knows, my personal page knows and my mobile phone knows. And that says something. So just keep your eyes on pavol.blogspot.com and you may be surprised.
