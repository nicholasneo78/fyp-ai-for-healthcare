 Well, I bought my plane ticket back to Flint yesterday. It's going to be nice to see my family again. Of course, as soon as I had my ticket I talked to my sister and learned that home sweet home has become more disturbing than ever. It's hard for Flint to shock me--we're talking about a city that considered selling the trees in its parks for lumber, but I'm actually starting to get scared. A friend's cousin was beaten to death in his car in front of his eight-year-old son. One of the editors at the magazine my sister writes her vegan cooking column for was beaten to near-death and left in the street. Oh, and two women were found dead, one downtown and the other near Mott Park. Mott Park for God's sake! My favorite neighborhood in Flint. Where I always wanted to live. Where I went to school. Where my sister and brother-in-law just bought a house. I always look forward to going home, but this time I'm getting an ominous, horror-movie feeling. I'm learning to appreciate Mankato more and more. I think I'll just stay in Flint long enough to see  Hamlet  (which I'm sure will be excellent) and then I'll head to the Saint Clair River Delta, relax on the island and watch the freighters float by. Oh and play with as many dogs as possible before I come back to No-pets-in-every-lease-ville, U.S.A.
