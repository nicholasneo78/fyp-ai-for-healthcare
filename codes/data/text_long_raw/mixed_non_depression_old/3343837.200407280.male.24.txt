 "Marriage, Marriage is what brings us together, today." -- The Princess Bride      Women can be frustrating. My girlfriend and I just had a very important discussion two weeks ago about getting married. She then left to go on vacation for two weeks with her family. Since she leff, I keep thinking that she will say she doesn't love me and doesn't want to marry me. I've told her I love her and that I want to marry her but haven't yet proposed.      She is the type that likes to know all about what's going to happen before it happens. So she asked me all about the future and what I think about when we should get married and what will happen after that. I told her I want to marry her in December. She objects because she is a school teacher (like me)and that is a busy time of year. I'm okay with doing it another time (like June) but I love her so much and want to begin my life with her right now.      Anyway, I'm ultimately worried that she will get scared and run away. But I'm probably being stupid and untrusting. She cares very much for me and I know that for sure, so I should just be content with that.
