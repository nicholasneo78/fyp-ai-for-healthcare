 I am sorry to EVERYONE who wants to read this, because I am boring, and a fool.  well, here goes, on my first day of Blog, I shall tell you the reasons why I hate... I dunno, I don't hate anything, except that bloody boat! god, I hope my parents sell it so I never have to look at it again. anyways, I got to see Carmen today, so my bad mood was all but over and done with, so I'm good, it's about 12:30 at night right now, and that's probably the reason why... I started... this blog, good night everybody.
