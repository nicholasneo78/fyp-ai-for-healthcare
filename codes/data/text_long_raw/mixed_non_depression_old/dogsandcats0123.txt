“Best friend” didn’t invite me to celebrate 21st.
I’ve been friends with this girl for over ten years. We were our first best friends. We ended up going to different schools throughout high school and college, but we never drifted too far. 
Yesterday, she turned 21. She was coming into town to go to a local bar, but I’m not of age yet. She told me I could come, but I figured she was just going to be there with her boyfriend and other friends who are 21. I didn’t want to sit there drinking a Sprite while they all got drunk, so I let her enjoy her evening. I figured she would celebrate later again anyway (which she is.) 
Today, she posts on her Snapchat story her and all our mutual friends (underage friends) drinking and having fun over in one of our friends apartments. I was not invited. I got her a gift and was ready to celebrate with her. I’m pretty disappointed, hurt, and feeling lame as usual. 
This has been a common theme for the past couple of years. She hangs with a select group of about 5 or 6 people who I’ve known longer than her. I don’t really get invited to anything at all, only once in a blue moon. She sometimes tries to hang out with me when she comes into town from college. 
Is it time to take a huge step back from this friendship? I don’t feel appreciated and I feel the effort is not there. Any advice?
