My friend wants to use my house, so she can be alone with her boyfriend. Should i let her?
So, my friend's got a boyfriend. They're in the "lovey dovey" phase right now, and they really want to consummate their relationship, i think they should wait until they're 18, but it's their choice to make.


Anyway, my conflict is this. They want to have sex, but they have nowhere to do it at. They're too poor for a hotel, and both their parents watch them like hawks whenever they're together. Plus, she gets taken too and from school, and her parents chaperone her everywhere else, since she doesn't have a car yet (they are making her work for her vehicle). As for him, his dad never leaves the house, and he has an "open door" rule, meaning they have to be where they can be seen and all doors open at all times at his house.


The only time her parents aren't watching her is when she's with me, we hang out a lot on the weekend, so they let her spend the night at my house often, because of my situation on the weekends.


On the weekends, my mother works late evening/nights, and she's gone until almost 6 in the morning. My father is sometimes their on the weekend, but he's often away, for months at a time (he's a trucker), he's gone right now actually. (THey let her stay with me so i can have company at home, when my parents are gone)


So, i'll be alone this weekend. Earlier today, her boyfriend came up to me and asked if they could "do the deed" in my house this weekend while my parents are out, he knows of my situation as well. They both want this, they practically begged me. I told them i would think about it.


So, should i allow this?
