Alcoholic dad
It's been like this since I was 6 years old. Just to give information, my family and I lived on a farm before I was six and I rarely got into contact with people outside of my family so I barely knew how to talk and would rather screech and be mad all the time and this led me to be very bad at my own language and have few "real" friends. My dad's problem started when he started drinking after the company he worked in shutdown I didn't know about it but my family fought about it without my knowing and I don't even know my siblings that well due to me never having gotten any real attention I just sat in my room while they fought at age six and played a game of Madagascar and shut it out I started understanding at age 10 how bad I was with actual relationships i barely know even now how to initiate discussions with other people or relatives and cryed, everyone started to fight at age 11 now at age 16 my dad drove me and my friend from my other friends due to us having had a LAN (played games) and he almost drove right into the railing of a bridge and that was today now that it wasn't just me who was endangered because of his fucking problem I started getting mad. He barely cares what I say and what my mom says he probably wants to leave my mom but doesn't have the financial expertise or job to do so. I dont know what to do and I barely have the guts to cut myself or anything just banging my head into a wall when my parents aren't home or watching people play games. If you read this whole thing thank you. My dad had gotten physical a few times as well. 

Sorry for the wall of text.
