I'm annoyed and tired of living with my brother
I have lived with my brother while I'm in college. Ever since I moved in, he has never washed the dishes or swept or mopped or clean anything really. He will only wash the dishes when I'm back home for breaks, and that's because there's no one else to do it for him. Every time my parents come and visit us, I'm the one who has to clean the whole apartment. He doesn't help me with any of that. One time I just snapped because my parents were coming to visit us and I had been cleaning the apartment all day and she wanted me to wash his sheets and clean his bathroom and I said no, if there's one thing he can do when he gets home from work it's take the time to clean his bathroom and wash his sheets. My mom bitched at me because I wouldn't do it. But I'm just so tired of having to do everything myself. In case anyone asks, yes, I do pay my half of the rent with my own money. So it's not fair. I just don't know what to do anymore because I don't like saying things that might make me seem like I'm being dramatic or bratty to my parents. And they know he doesn't clean anything. They know I do it all by myself but they don't ever say anything to him. My parents are just so controlling too. They don't even let me drive anywhere out of town by myself and they sure as hell won't let me live anywhere else. I still have until December when I'll finish school that I'm still gonna have to live with my brother. I'm just so frustrated and don't even know what to do anymore.
