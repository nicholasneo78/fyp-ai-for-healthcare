 Well I must admit that I have gotten into all of the hype about this new mail account that google is offering. Called GMail, and I have seen alot of people already with account even though they are in the beta stage. People are getting invites from other people but nobody has invited me yet. When I do get a invite, I would really like to have andrew@gmail.com but I highly doubt that it will still be avaliable to use. It's always nice to want stuff isn't it?  I'd also like $1,000 :) send it to me by mail, thanks.
