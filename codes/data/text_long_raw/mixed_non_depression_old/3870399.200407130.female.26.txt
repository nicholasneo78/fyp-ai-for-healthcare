 The other day Jay and I went with a few of his friends to celebrate our birthdays.  Some of us had fun at On the Border.  Then we went to see Anchorman.  About the only part of the movie that I liked was the soundtrack.  My husband doesn't understand my sense of humor.  Yes of course there were parts of the movie that were funny, but other than that I didn't like it that much.  I am just not that big of Will Ferrell fan.  Big woop on seeing him chest exposed.  It looks like he permed his chest hair to get it that curly.  I would have rather seen the Terminal or Chronicles of Riddick. Ohhh Well.  A girl can dream.
