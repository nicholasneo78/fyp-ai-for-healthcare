I'm sick of my parents
I just cant stand them anymore. They treat me like a shit compared to my sister. I never ask my parents for money I eat at home so they don't give me money for lunch I don't buy things I'm using old phone that i bought 6 years ago with my own money. But my mother changed 3 phones in the last year. They threat my sister a lot better they gifted her a phone for christmas i got some shitty speakers that had the price tag on and believe me their price was not close to the phone's. They bought her a new car last year they gave her the money for the driving lessons and she want money from them everyday. So i need a new PC at the moment so i thought that i might ask them because i really need it and that's the only thing i have ever ask my parents for my I haven't asked for a single cent in my whole life. Everything i buy i buy with my saved money from grandparents. I even buy my studentbooks with my own money. And they refused. They told me if i have the money to buy it but I spent all i had to buy furniture for my room if i didn't i would've gotten only a bed in my room. I feel hated. They don't spend time with me neither give me money. Yesterday I offered them to give me the money for the PC and when i have the money i will return them but they still said no. I legit have no idea why they do it. I don't go out often i don't argue with them  and i have decent grades in school. They are so unfair.
