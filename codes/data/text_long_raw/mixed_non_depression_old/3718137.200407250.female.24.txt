 Allright, I have a job again. I now am the secretary/customer service/first level tech at Lakeshore Computer Consulting, LLC and Midview Internet Services. My little brother is a tech there, so he got me the job. It's going allright, but the owner tends to swear a bit more than I am comfortable with. He kinda flies off the handle about really stupid shit, and has a tendency to make you feel like crap, so hopefully I'll just learn to let it go, and get used to it.
