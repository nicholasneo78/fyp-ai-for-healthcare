How should I deal with this flaky friend?
I have a friend who I totally love who ALWAYS flakes. whether the plans are big or small 95% of the plans we make (initiated by her often) end up with "I don't feel like going out" or "i made other plans" or "i don't remember making these plans" etc. This is super annoying and all but it's not the whole problem.

Since she's super flaky I always call her out on it or joke about it. for example: In our group chat another friend will make plans and she'll be like "ok its set" and then i'll reply like "that only means it's half set" and I know I'm being snarky and all but she deserves it for being such a flake! right? Anyway I guess it really annoys her when i do this so she confronted me about it calling me a bitch for always making jokes about her being flaky and asked me not to do it anymore. I agreed but I kind of wish I didn't and now i feel like not even replying when we talk in our group chat. Im sure making snarky comments about someone being a flake can't be anywhere near as annoying as constantly being flaked on, Right? There's been some huge plans that she flaked on including travel and birthday plans that really upset me especially since she's such a good friend and it means a lot to me for her to make it to those special occasions.

Does anyone have any advice on how to move forward? Should I just pretend it never happened and continue like usual or should I say/do something? What's your experience with friends like this?
