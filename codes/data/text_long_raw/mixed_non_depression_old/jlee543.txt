Am I being a jerk?
I’m back home visiting for a week. I have been gone for almost a year, and I have several people i want to spend time with in a limited amount of time. I made dinner plans with a former coworker who I am not super close with. We were friends when we worked together, but haven’t stayed in touch since I’ve been away.  With only a few days left, I am finding myself wanting to spend time with my close friends.  In addition, it will take me at least 2 hours round trip traveling on public transportation to get to and from the town where she lives.  I want to cancel, but I know it will hurt her feelings.  What is the right thing to do?

Tl;dr: I made dinner plans with a former coworker that I want to cancel, but I know it will hurt her feelings. What should I do?
