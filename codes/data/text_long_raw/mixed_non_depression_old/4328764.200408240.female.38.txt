 Hoss is my bulldog (for anyone that sees this but doesn't know me), and he is a spoiled one at that. This how we have found him when we came home on several occasions. You can't see it in the picture, but there was a Corona on the railing and his daddy was grilling hamburgers for us...including him.  I wonder what he does that we don't see...maybe I don't want to know, eh?  Anyway, he does weigh at least 62 lbs here. He still thinks he's small enough to be a lap dog, and will climb up in my lap every time he gets tired just to prove it. Of course, at that point I am pinned and have to move a mountain to get up out of the chair. But he has more kisses than I can stand sometimes, and plenty left over for anyone that comes to visit.  I'm definitely a Bulldogger!
