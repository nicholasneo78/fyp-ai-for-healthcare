 Well I can't say that I'm upset right now with the way things are going.  M and I are talking all the time, and I can't get her out of my head.  She loves me :D  I love her too.  Now my only issue is the time...  I'm still afraid that two years would be way too long of a time right now, and then, even if we made it, it'd be another 2 and a half again before anything could REALLY happen.  N is still an issue, because she e-mails me constantly, and I stil care for her, but in the end, M will be mine.  I don't know what to do about N though.  I keep thinking about my life, and the person that I am.  I want to change stuff.  It's time that I clean up, and I plan to actually do it and stick to it this time.  For the first time in a long time, I'm happy with my life.
