I’m tired of pretending your sexually explicit jokes are funny
I’m a lady, but I’m also pretty chill and a total bro. Sometimes, I think the sexually explicit memes are funny, but recently that’s ALL my guy friends talk about. It’s getting annoying, and plenty of other things are funny too that we can talk about. How do I tell them I’m getting tired of “send nudes” and “bobs and vegana” jokes without being “that girl who can’t take a joke”
