 I am going to give this whole blog thing a try.  I have quite a few friends who do this, and I find it very entertaining to read some of their stuff. :)  I also think it may be kind of fun and refreshing just to get on here and talk and talk ;) no one can talk back! At least directly!  So we'll see how this goes, hopefully better than any attempt I've made at journalling! Here's to "Amberitions"!
