 It seems to be a very long day today. Feeling sleepy and stuff. :(   Knight Online's gonna start charging really soon. Don't know whether to pay or not to pay. Why do these online games have to charge? Can't they remain free throughout ur entire life? I would seriously love free P2P games.  Samsung phones are really getting the best of me. I seem to be bored of Samsung phones already. I do not know why. They are basically something like Nokia also. Same phone functions, different name only.
