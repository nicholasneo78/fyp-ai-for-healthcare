 Now that it's the middle of July, and my best friend is in California for the entire month, and my computer doesn't have internet, I feel really strange. It's like lonely, but not necessarily bored. Last week I rented Prince of Persia: Sands of Time for my Gamecube, and even kept the game past its due date  to finish it, it was that good. So I'm not necessarily bored. Like tonight, for instance, I finished 'Lucky', by Eddie de Oliveira (he's cute). It was a really good book, and I'm glad I read it. However, now that the game is played, and the book is read, I seriously need something more to do. I hoped to have a job by now, but then, I had also hoped to be going on student exchange this autumn, but it's amazing how, no matter how hard you try, some plans just refuse to come to fruition. It's neurotic.
