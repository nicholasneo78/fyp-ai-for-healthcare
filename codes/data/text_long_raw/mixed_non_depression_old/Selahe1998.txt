Just found out my family’s opinion of me.
I walked by the kitchen and they were all talking about what a loser I am. My mom was leading the “discussion”. Everyone was involved except my dad.  I told my dad what was going on and he  went off on them.


I’m just in my room thinking about how hurt I am. Especially considering I’ve been doing all my moms chores for her. Pretty much doing everything she should do.  The only person who came to my defense was my dad. 

I told him I’m going to move out and he told me he wants me to stay. I think what really hurts is it feels like my whole family is against me. After hearing what they said, I kind of hate them. I think I need to get away from this situation. But I have literally have no one else.
