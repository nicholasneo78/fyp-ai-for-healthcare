I know I'm overreacting but I need to vent
So there is this girl I've been friends with for three years. Right now she is almost done with college but I still have to take some courses so we don't see each other that often. That's why she told me two weeks ago we should meet up. I told her to pick out the day which suit her best. She said Monday and I agreed. Turns out my mum needed money so I have almost nothing on me and because of that I told her I could hang out but couldn't go to the restaurant she said we should try. She replied that she "couldn't make it tomorrow" (today) and I thought wth?! you said Monday? It was you the one who said Monday not me... Anyway she said let's meet up on Wednesday and I said ok but tbh I don't feel like going out whatsoever. She was sorry because, and I quote, "I thought we were going to meet today" and I'm like dafuq. She, all of a sudden, forgot about it?! Does it make any sense? I guess she made plans with other people or whatever but fuck it, don't say one thing and then act like you didn't even say anything. I know I'm overreacting here but I'm so fucking tired of people and their "you're my best friend" and "I love you, I care about you" shit. The thing is I guess I'm pretty pissed off because I've always struggled to make friends but even when I have they don't give a shit. I'm so tired. Honestly, fuck everyone.
