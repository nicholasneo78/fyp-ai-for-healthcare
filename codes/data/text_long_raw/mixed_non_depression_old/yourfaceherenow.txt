I’m afraid of my family falling apart after my grandfather passes away
I need advice. My mother passed away from cancer 4 years ago now. I have two brothers in their 20s. One hasn’t finished his associates and the other in nursing school but takes every chance he can get to get away from helping the family. My father is an irresponsible alcoholic who thinks it’s beneath him to wash even his own dishes.

I currently live in San Francisco and trying to get into medical school and making up for my precious failures in college.

My grandfather is the patriarch of the family. He always has been and has been the glue to keeping it together. I’m worried that if my grandfather passes away that my father will go deeper into alcoholism and my little brother will be his forever caretaker. 

I’m so scared. I’m the only female in my family left and I feel so overwhelmed and burdened. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to go. I don’t even know how to help myself. 

There have been days when I’ve come and my father has passed out on the couch and hasn’t eaten. I just feel like I come from a trashy family and there’s no way out.
