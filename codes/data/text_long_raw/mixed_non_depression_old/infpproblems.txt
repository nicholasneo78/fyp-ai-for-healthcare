Annoyed and I feel absolutely horrible about it
My parents have recently recovered from some financial issues that caused them to move out of state. A little over a year ago, my father found a job back in the state where I currently live and has been staying at my place during the weeks when he works. As much as I love my parents though, sometimes I really struggle with sharing my limited space, i.e. a very small one bedroom apartment. 

What makes it even more difficult is the fact that I rarely ever know ahead of time when he's coming and when he isn't. And when he does come, he doesn't knock. He just walks right in using the spare key that I came home to find was gone (without first being asked if it was okay to take) a while back. 

It honestly makes me feel like I'm twelve again. I worked very hard to become independent and to have my own life and space and now... I don't. I hadn't even been on my own for a year when all of this started. 

I can't say anything about it because my mother always downplays it by saying, "You'll be fine. We're family." And the one time I even indirectly said something to my father, just by casually asking if he'd taken my spare key, I got a phone call from my mother saying that he was upset and essentially blamed me for them having to move to begin with. 

Long story short, I don't know what to do. I feel so terrible to be annoyed with the situation, but I am.
