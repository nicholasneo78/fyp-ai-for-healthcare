Please help our study on parental attitudes towards storytelling robots for their kids
Hi there! We are inviting parents whose kids are younger than 7 years of age to fill out our survey on storytelling robots. This survey is part of a study being conducted by Indiana University that aims at investigating parental acceptance and attitudes of storytelling robots for their kids and will inform the future design of robots for kids.

It should not take more than 15-20 minutes of your time. Two hundred participants will be randomly selected following a random drawing to receive a $5 Amazon credit (a digital gift card for Amazon shopping). The survey was distributed on February 7, 2018, and the drawing will be conducted on March 1, 2018. After March 1, you can complete the survey if you choose, but you will not receive any compensation for doing so. Personal identifiable information will only be collected for payment records.

For more information about the study: contract the researchers at lin98@iu.edu and brady@iupui.edu. For general information about participant rights, contact the Indiana University Institutional Review Board at (812) 856-4242 or via email at irb@iu.edu.

We'd appreciate it if you participate in this survey! Link to the survey: https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8tYqRw05QRWt08t
