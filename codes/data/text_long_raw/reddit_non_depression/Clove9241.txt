I’m not her storage building
At the beginning of the year my friend move out (her choice) and my boyfriend moved.  She left some stuff behind and I would tell her to come get it all the time it’s a small apartment and there really isn’t any room for me to stores her stuff here.  She would just say “yea I’ll be by soon” well  a few months ago we we’re cleaning the apartment making room for a baby and told him to take her stuff to storage.
