Am I being paranoid?
I joined Girl Crew a few months ago. For those who don't know, it's basically an app for women to make friends. A few of us girls met up twice and have a group chat. We're planning to go to a rally tomorrow, and we all expressed our interest in getting a drink afterwards. Two of the girls tagged/mentioned the others in the group in something on FB - places to go for drinks. Both times I was not mentioned, despite saying that I'd like to go. So, am I being paranoid? Or do I have a right to be upset? Rationally, I shouldn't be. We don't know each other that well, so they can't hate me yet. But I don't know. I didn't make the best first impression, so maybe they don't want to be near me at all. I might not even go tomorrow; I might remove myself from the group chat/delete them off FB. What should I do?
