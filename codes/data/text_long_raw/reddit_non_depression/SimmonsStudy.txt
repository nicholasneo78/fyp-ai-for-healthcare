Tell us about your formula feeding experience.
Hello Everyone, 

We are currently Masters students at Simmons College in Boston, MA completing our thesis and need your help! You are invited to take part in a survey exploring why mothers formula feed compared to breastfeeding, and what influences caregivers to choose one brand of infant formula over another. The survey takes approximately 5-15 minutes to complete and can be completed by mobile phone or computer by clicking the link below. Taking part in this survey is completely voluntary, any answer can be skipped at any time, and all answers will remain anonymous and strictly confidential. This survey is strictly for educational purposes and will not be used in any marketing initiatives whatsoever.
