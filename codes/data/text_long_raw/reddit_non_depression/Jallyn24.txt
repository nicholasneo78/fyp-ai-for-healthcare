Imminent Death of a Loved One
So let me start by saying I’ve been fortunate enough to have never lost a family member or really close friend, so this is all foreign to me.  My grandpa has had cancer for quite a while and it’s getting worse. Whenever I visit it’s something that is never really talked about and he seems to not really want to talk about it and doesn’t really let any of us know what is going on and down plays the situation. Recently I’ve picked up on several indicators that lead me to believe the end is near. I don’t really know what the best thing to do is, but I know one thing and that’s that I don’t want to miss any moments, let him down in his last days or regret anything for the rest of my life. He has lived a long and extraordinary life and has so many stories and so much wisdom. One thing is that I want to be able to tell my future kids about him and carry on that legacy after he passes and there are many stories that I can’t myself recite and many that I am sure that I haven’t even heard. I guess what I’m looking for is maybe someone who has gone through this sort of thing and can share maybe some things that they did or wish they would’ve done before their loved one passed away. Two things kind of come to mind but I don’t know how to bring it up. Maybe to have him write some things down in a journal or to record something. I’m also just open to hearing anyone else’s stories.

Thanks in advance
