Am i a bad friend? I don't know what to do
Recently two friends of mine (dating) have cut me off entirely without providing a reason... Let's call them J and K. J is an old friend from years back, when we were kids, and K has been my friend since highschool (approx. Six years). Its happened before that they've cut me off periodically for no given reason, then their idea of making up is inviting me to a party and never speaking of the weeks or months that they had me blocked on social media, when i ask them to explain they get defensive, and say things along the lines of "you KNOW what you did" even when i try to explain that no, i actually don't. I've never consciously done anything to hurt them, the one thing i thought it could be was that I'm friends with a girl they dislike, but after recently confronting J its apparently not just that, there's a long list of reasons why I'm a terrible friend but he "doesn't have time to list them" or even name one. Feeling insecure about this I've confided in other friends who assure me that I'm not a bad friend, although I've asked that they tell me if i ever act like a bitch. 
Back to K and J, they recently went so far as to invite all 3 of my siblings along with a crowd of people they barely know to their housewarming, but made a point to exclude me- when my brother asked why the response was along the lines of I'm "acting like a bitch". I've tried just cutting them out but its hard after being friends (i think) for so many years. I've tried extending olive branches, explaining that i don't know what I've done wrong and if they could at least tell me then maybe i could apologize/fix the situation, but J responded with passive aggression and K, so far, hasn't responded at all. (Quite frankly i don't expect her to). 

Bottom line is, should i just cut them off entirely? Its hard since I'll be seeing a lot of K this year as we're studying the same course, and J is one of my brother's best friends. Please help
