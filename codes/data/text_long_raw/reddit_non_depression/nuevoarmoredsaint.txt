What is a functional family?
I know what a dysfunctional family is and I have plenty of experiences from my formative years to share with y’all but, I am not going to regale you with a “woe is me” diatribe.  That’s not my objective today.

My objective is to seek positive experiences to better understand the foundational attributes of a functional family.  I believe, in fact, I know these families exist based on my South American experiences from an entire society but, what about North America? Families are families no matter the country you live in but, is the lack of family attributes / cohesion as a collective whole uniquely North American for many of us but, not all? 

In short, let’s dig in to uncover some of these positive family attributes in my next post and I look forward to reading your responses.
