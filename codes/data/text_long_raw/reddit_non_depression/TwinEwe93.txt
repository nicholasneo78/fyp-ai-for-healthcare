I feel like I am annoying my friend.
I have noticed recently that I have been texting my friend a lot and I’m the one to always start the conversation.  The thing is, I am usually the shy one and they are the outgoing one.  Since they don’t start conversations, I feel like I am annoying them or bothering them.  What do you guys think?  Has something like this happened to you?
