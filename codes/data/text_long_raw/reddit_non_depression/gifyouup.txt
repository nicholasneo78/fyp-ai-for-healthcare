I (28) did a DNA test on 23andme it told me I had a cousin I didn't know about.
My BF and I decided to do DNA tests because they were on sale for black friday. We got our results back last week. I said yes to see family relationships. Turns out I have a cousin in the system. She reached out to me for information but I didn't even know she existed. 

Her bio mom says they she isn't ready to be in contact with her. From what I gather it was a teenage pregnancy and my grandparents forced her to give up the baby , moved her to a house for unwed mothers and moved the whole family away from their hometown to avoid embarrassment . I think it was a very traumatic experience for her and she may not want to bring up those memories. 

I feel stuck in the middle now and don't know how to deal with the situation. I suffer from social anxiety and this whole situation has caused me panic attacks. I feel bad for my newly found cousin and don't want to break her heart but I can't go around my aunts wishes. 

I don't have a lot of information about the family that I could pass on without talking to my aunt or other family members. I am the youngest cousin and my grandparents passed away when I was quite young. I'm not super close with my extended family but that's mostly due to my social anxiety , I care a lot about them and don't want to hurt any of them. 

Help please!
