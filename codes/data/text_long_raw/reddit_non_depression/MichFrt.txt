What do I even do with this friends?
They are one of the best friends I have ever gotten. And only friends as for now too, since I find it really difficult to make friends, and to keep an stable relationship without screwing it up even thought what I value the most in my life is my friends.
As of the last 2 months they have been unactive (We only talk online and see each other from time to time), not talking to me, saying they get bored of our conversation, never starting a conversation. 
And never consider to invite me to hangout, they just do it for themselves. I'm not sure how to feel anymore, when I am in person with them we have tons of fun, and sometimes when we talk the conversations are really interesting and fun too.

I always feel uneasy and not comfortable about them... So what should I do? 

If you want more details as for something ask for it.
