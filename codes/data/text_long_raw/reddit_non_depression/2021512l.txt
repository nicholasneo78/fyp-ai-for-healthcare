Husbands Family
So long story short my husband use to live with his older brother and his wife and kids. My husband was always there for the kids he grew really attached to them. But since we got together and then got married he saw the kids less and less. So yesterday his brother’s wife texted him and asked him not to forget about his niece and nephew that they really miss him and that they notice that he no longer spends time with them. She says they are sad. So it kind of made me angry because ever since we got together my husbands mom his brother and the mother of the kids have always tried to push the kids on him. One time we had them over and we’re going to drop them off and well they got mad because we couldn’t keep them.  They always want him to be there for them like if he’s the father and he’s not his just the uncle. And I don’t like when he brings them over because it’s like they don’t even acknowledge I am here. The kids don’t like me and it’s noticeable I guess they’re mad because I took their uncle away. I’m I wrong for getting mad at this I mean we are going to have our on kids some day and I don’t need them getting jealous or not liking my kids only because he will no longer spend time with them.
