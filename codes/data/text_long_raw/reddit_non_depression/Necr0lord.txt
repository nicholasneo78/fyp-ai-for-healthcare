[Serious]I broke a close friends heart and now i don't know what to do?
[Serious] So i've been friends with this girl for around 4 years and we got really close for the past 1 year. I started having problems with other friends family and uni like 3 months ago. Basically a depressive state. And i started to treat this friend badly during these months. Sometime i would realize it and go "sorry i've been treating you bad for the last couple of days because of etc etc" And she always went it's okay i can understand you. For the last 2 weeks i realized that she started ignoring my texts and stuff. I waited 5 days for a reply to a single text. At the end i got mad and texted her again saying "I don't know what to think of you anymore" Then she replied to that with a long text blaming me for stuff and how i've changed, how we didn't get to know each other properly etc. and a few other stuff that she got completely wrong idea of. I replied with a long message explaining everything to her but she didn't reply to it. We haven't talked for a week. Today i wrote a handwritten letter to her and im planning to send it to her tomorrow. It's a 3 page long letter explaining how sorry i am, how i ruined stuff and telling how much i love her and how much i want her to forgive me. ( i know it sounds bad in sentence but it's actually a very touching letter ) Do you think i should send it? I'm actually afraid that she might not open the letter at all when she sees that it's from me. I really want her back and regret everything i did.
