30 mins ago i found out my mom(47f) has 6Months-1Year to live
My mom has kidney failure, she just started dialysis. I(20f) dont know how to deal with it, i dont know how to feel about this or what to do. I just wanna break down and cry but i dont wanna make her feel more stressed or feel like everything is her fault. 

I dont even know if her doctor is right, i dont like her doctor at all. Her doctor says she had lung cancer, which was false. He said she has breast cancer, which is false. How do i know that hes right about this? What should i do with my mom? She been feeling really down since she found out. She basically has her life on a timer, thats sad to say.. i just dont know what to do, how do i deal with this situation? I dont have no one to vent to thatll understand what im going through.
