Losing my Best Friend
Ive been best friends with someone for over 11 years now. Not that the amount of time matters but probably helps to understand why im here. Recently i feel very distant from her. We dont talk as often and well this has happened before but before it was as if we never stopped talking when we did message/meet the other again. This time it feels off. I hung out with her about a week ago and after she told me she felt .. awkward .. this totally messed with my mind. She just wasnâ€™t comfortable anymore? At this point i dont know what to do. I reach out to her but her schedule gets in the way im afraid this is the end of our friendship. Any advice?
P.S
Im very open with her, ive communicated this concern to her and there has been no change.
