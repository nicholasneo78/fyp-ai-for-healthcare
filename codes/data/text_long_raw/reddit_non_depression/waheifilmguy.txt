Trying to help family of friend who committed suicide, any ideas?
My friend took his life almost a year ago and his family (wife and three daughters aged 10, 14 and 18) is still reeling. None of them are getting the emotional support they need. His wife doesn't regularly see her therapist, she stays out all night several times a week with her new boyfriend, the 18 year old has suicidal thoughts, the 14 year old just feels hated by mom and, along with the 10 year old, is not getting therapy. The 18 year old is getting therapy but she's hardcore into her new religious affiliation, hating mom and can't wait to leave for college 

I've talked to the wife several times and shared my thoughts about what's going on, she's receptive when I when I speak to her, but it's apparent after this amount of time that she has no real intention of going through with getting the kids counseling and getting into family therapy, staying home more, spending more time with the kids, less time with the husband, etc.

Does anyone have any idea how I can help? If I keep telling her what she's not doing well, I'm afraid she's going to shut me out and then I won't be able to do anything.  

If this isn't a good sub for this kind of thing and you have an idea what might be, please let me know. 

Edit--I live in NYC, they are outside of Dallas, TX, so seeing them isn't much of an option. Also, the wife has been cut off from her deceased husband's family due to some of her behavior, and doesn't have any support from her side of the family led by her mentally ill mother. 

Thank you.
