Is he justified for being so mad ?? Thoughts on my plan?? No judgment please??
6 months ago I stayed with my aunt for two weeks but I really wanted to see my cousin who I’ve been talking to on Facebook.  Well,  I didn’t get to see him until like the day before I was supposed to leave and didn’t get to speak with him as the way we were seated at our gathering I’d have to literally yell across the table and I’m not like that.   So later that night I got in an uber and went to his house around like 11 pm lmfao and I told him I was coming but he was like no and he was pissed that I didn’t say much to him but I showed up it was raining, freezing, windy, etc and he didn’t let me in and so I left and went back to the airport cuz I didn’t have enough money to go all the way back to my aunts it was like 60 something miles away I only had enough to get to Newark. But he got super pissed at me and won’t talk to me blocked me on all social media but your girl is about to take that train for 5 hours and go again in like July/August but I’m not telling him I’m just gonna wait till he gets off of work.  I have zero way of contacting him other than physically going there.  Any idea what I should say so he can forgive me ?  I’m aware what I’m doing could potentially make things worse but if I leave it be we might not ever speak again.  I’ve also lost a substantial amount of weight since then and he probably won’t recognize me?  Thoughts please ?  I know what some of you might say but I really want to fix this??
