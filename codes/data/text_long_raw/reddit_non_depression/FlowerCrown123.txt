I want to tell her, but...
Im the kind of girl who doesnt keep secrets from my mom. Recently Ive been keeping a little more. 

First of all, I’m in seventh grade. Just saying. 

The first secret I’m keeping is Snapchat. I’m not really supposed to have it but all my friends did so I made an account maybe last month and I use it regularly. 

I don’t see the need to tell my mom about this :/

But what I want to tell her but am afraid to is that I am dating someone. Last year I dated a boy and she wasn’t mad, she just wanted to know everything. I mean everything. She’d go through all my messages with him, she’d stalk him on Instagram (from my account!), she’d see if he texted me and sit next to me on the bed and watch me text him and tell me what I can and can’t say. 

I’m not an inappropriate girl. I get straight A’s, I shame on premarital sex and all that. It’s not like I’m a underage whore (trust me, we have those) and I won’t send nudes!

I really like this guy and he likes me back. He told his mom we were dating literally the day he asked me out. My best friend and her crush (who likes her back) already told their moms about each other. 

My mom won’t let me date anymore because it’s a “distraction” and I don’t need to be “messing with hormonal boys” WHICH I’M NOT ! 

(Also I text this guy on SnapChat, that’s another reason I can’t tell her I have it because then she would demand my password for it and then look through all my messages on there.)

I just wish it would be as easy for me as it is easy for them to tell my mom. Its making me feel super guilty because just yesterday she told me “I love you. You’re such a good daughter.” Which she’s NEVER told me before and she hugged me which she never does unless she wants something. 

I’m literally just trying to have some fun in middle school like everyone else. 

:(

Please help.
