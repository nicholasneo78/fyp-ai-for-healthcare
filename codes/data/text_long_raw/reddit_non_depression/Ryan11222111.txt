How do I get over a friendship?
Hi all,
I have gotten over people in the past... but having trouble here.  The problem is that they treat all their other friends so good - but not me.  So, it just hurts even more to get over this (I am the one ending the friendship because of how they treat me).  I think I could get over it, if they were just a jerk or a bad friend - but they're not.  They're just a bad friend to me.  Any advice would be so helpful just to read and know maybe I'm not alone with the kind of pain.
