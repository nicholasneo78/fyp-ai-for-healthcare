Working Mom Researcher Still Seeking Pregnant Working Ladies for Paid Academic Research Study
First of all, just want to say a big thank you those who have signed up from 1 month ago. I'm very grateful for all of your support. For those who just read this, I'm a working mom and Psychology researcher at George Mason University currently conducting a study on challenges faced by moms-to-be at work. It is my hope that studies like this can allow us to better advocate for moms and to make work a more family-friendly placce. The survey study is paid up to $40 in Amazon giftcard and a raffle for an iPad. No travel is required. For more details to sign up, please visit the following site. I cannot do this research without the help of all of your wonderful ladies, so please help spread the word! sites.google.com/site/cheungdiversitylab/pregnancy-and-the-workplace
