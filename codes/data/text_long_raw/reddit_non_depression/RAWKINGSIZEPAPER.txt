As I sit here waiting for my friends to come over, I’ve come to realize how important friendship is. Friends can take the place of family and at the end of the day our true friends are always by our side win or lose! Isn’t it funny someone not related to you can be so important. I’m grateful.
Always show love to those that take the time to know the REAL you not the person you are in public. Next time you see a true friend cherish every min because you’ll never have a better friend.
