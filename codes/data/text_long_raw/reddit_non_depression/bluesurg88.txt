How does one cope with not talking with anyone for the longest time? I am lonely but there's nothing I can do to have friends at the moment ðŸ˜”
My friends have mostly been away or busy with their own lives. I am now in a graduate school where I have no close friend as my closest friend recently ignored me and refused to talk anymore. I have had lots of friends before but after graduation, things changed. 

How do you cope with being alone most of the time? I do keep myself busy but man, having no one else to talk to can be deafening. The silence is just real.
