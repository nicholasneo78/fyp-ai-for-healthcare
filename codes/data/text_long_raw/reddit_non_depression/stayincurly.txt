Long distance girlfriend's family abusive to her
I'm in a long distance relationship, and my girlfriend's family totally neglects her. She has a mom, dad, and older sister.  The older sister is constantly cherished, and in her parent's eyes, does nothing wrong. My gf has to buy anything she wants, while her older sister gets everything handed to her. My gf gets almost straight A's, her older sister flunks classes. My gf's parents help pay for her sister's tuition, but kinda just shrug in her direction. Basically, her sister gets everything, and she gets the rags. Just today her sister went and broke her iPad screen for no reason, and her mom said she didn't believe her when she told her what happened. The older sister never gets grounded, but the gf gets grounded almost everyday, sometimes because her family "doesn't wanna see her face." So fucked up, right?

Does anybody think there's a way for her to cope with her family's behavior? She's (hopefully) moving away to attend school in a year.
