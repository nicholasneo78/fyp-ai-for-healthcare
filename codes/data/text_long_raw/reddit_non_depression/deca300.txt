What happened?
Hi guys,

Just wondering if any of you have experienced this.

I grew up in the happiest family ever. My mom and dad were always so happy and positive about everything in life. I'm 30 now, things have changed so much. It is mainly my mother. She is very negative about everything. Nothing ever gets her excited, she doesn't want to do anything. She doesn't want to have family to visit them anymore. She doesn't really want to go out. As long as she's at home with her dogs she's "happy"

She is basically miserable and moody every single day. I really don't understand it. She was never like this. Have any of you had this? What did you do to deal with it? It's like she prefers being negative over anything. Nothing gets her excited. Nothing makes her happy? It's so shit.
