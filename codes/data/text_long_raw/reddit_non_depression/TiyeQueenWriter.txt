How do you count back generations?
If a distant relative of yours came to the USA in 1907 as a man in twenties and had children 1917. Is that your great great grandfather? Let's say the man was Japanese, how much Japanese do you have in you? In 1936 your grandmother was born, she's quarter Japanese.
