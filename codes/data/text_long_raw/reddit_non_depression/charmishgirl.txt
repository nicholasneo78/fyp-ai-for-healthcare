What’s the worst thing a friend has ever said to you?
 I have two stories. 

1. This was a few years ago. It was near Christmas time. I had gotten my friend a $300 iPod. I was planning on giving it to her the week before Christmas. So a week prior to me giving her the present, I take her to the movies. I worked at the movie theater so the ticket was free. But I got her a few pins we sell, we got a photo at the photo booth, and we got concessions. The total was probably around $50. When I got to paying for the popcorn and candy, my coworker said it was nice of me to pay for all of it. I jokingly said “this is her Christmas present.” My friend said that it was the cheapest present. Should have taken the iPod back after that, just to be petty. But she had been in a serious car accident that year so I reconsidered that. 

2. This one was recent. We live in different countries. She texted me, after not speaking for three days due to busy schedules, about how I’m lucky to not have a health issue. I thought she was just upset with her life. But she was evidently mad at me. She made it seem like I don’t deserve my Masters degree because I didn’t work as hard for mine since I didn’t have to overcome any health issues. The worst thing she said was that I keep bragging about my life, but “nobody cares about you.” She tried apologizing maybe five minutes later but I ignored it. She somehow assumed I wouldn’t be angry. After many texts, I told her that I was upset and that I needed space. She got upset that I was upset about what she said. Just because you are sick and your life feels like shit, that doesn’t give you the right to say something like that to someone and still expect to be friends. Two weeks later she told me how my happy posts were annoying her and she hated it. Blocked her without replying. 

Sometimes we need to let things go. The people who are your friends will never say stuff like this.
