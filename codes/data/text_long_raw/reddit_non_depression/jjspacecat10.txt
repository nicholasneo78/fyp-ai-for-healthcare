Is family still a relevant institution in modern society?
I might be a little biased with this question. I'm 16, living in an Asian immigrant family in the US. The situation is eroding fast, and I see families around me all becoming dysfunctional, including "native" families. What are the factors leading to such problems in the US ( divorce, pointless feuds, money, etc) and is being part of family even worth all the problems?
