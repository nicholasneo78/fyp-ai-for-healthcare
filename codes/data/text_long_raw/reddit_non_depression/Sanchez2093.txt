Weird Dreams
So I have this issue I keep dreaming about sexual relations with my Sister in Law. Trust me when I say I love my wife and actually consider her sister to be a good friend and almost like a sister. Although these last couple of dreams I've  dreamt my Sister in law naked or us doing things and I feel weird when I wake up after. Now yes she is an attractive woman but I don't see her that way at all. Does this make me a bad Husband or is there some scientific thing behind this???? Please help cause I can't even talk to her sister without feeling weird or remembering her naked. Also which I've never seen her naked at all in case that becomes a question.
