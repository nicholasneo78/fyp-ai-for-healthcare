I News Your advice
Hi, Iâ€™m 18. 

my mom passed away three years ago, now  I live with my dad whoâ€™s a wonderful dad and I really love him but thereâ€™s this situation that I donâ€™t know how to handle :

He got involved into a sex club or something like  50 shades of gray, I donâ€™t know exactly what it is but I know that many women send him naked pictures and he is like a master, he tortures them sexually and they accept. 

I know heâ€™s been involved with that for a long time, even when he was married with my mom, but he doesnâ€™t know I know all that. 

One day I asked him to answer me sincerely what was that, or just say nothing if he didnâ€™t want to. He lied to me but I said nothing. 

Today I found by mistake a bag of women underwear with panties in My home I left it open so heâ€™ll know I saw it. Should I confront him ? What should I say ? Iâ€™m really scared ðŸ˜Ÿ
