Why did my friend do this to me?
Here is the context, this guy and I were friends for 11 years, but he works at a coffee shop full time for 40 hours a week. Also, he moved out of his parents place and lived in a condo with his 2 brothers. Every time I try to invite him, he always tells me that he's busy and that he does not have time for me, but when I see a video or a photo of him on facebook or instagram, I see him making time for his other friends, but never me, and he never invites me either. My question is why?
