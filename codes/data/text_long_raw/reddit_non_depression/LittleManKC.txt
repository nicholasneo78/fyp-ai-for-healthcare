I'm unsure of our friend status - it's making head go crazy and heart go ballistic
A few months earlier this year a friend of mine and I had dinner, we started talking about our personal lives - I've discovered things he went through and it hurt my heart to find out what he went through. He was able to open up to me and I felt privilegged to be that friend whom he's shared this with. He's closer to two other guys other than me but he's told me he hasn't told anyone else his dark side other than me. I hope to open up to him one day. Ever since then I felt like I want protect him and see him find his happiness/ reach his goals and find the girl of his dreams. My head has going around in cirlces and I feel like I need to have a proper conversation with him to confirm what this friendship means to him. As to me, I felt like I met a really cool guy whom I would call one of my best friends - we laugh at the same jokes, share some similar interests and I find him inspiring. 

... I guess what I'm seeking is advice on how to approach him about this.
Just because lately I feel like there's a gap between us that I try to close by talking to him more but... I just don't know.
