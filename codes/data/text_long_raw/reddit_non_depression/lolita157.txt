Is my friend acting dumb?
So, my friend has been dating this guy for a couple of years. Not only did he cheat on her but he got another woman pregnant. She found nudes of other girls on his phone. They broke up, got back together, etc. Hes been trying to prove hes changed to her... blah blah. 
My friend told me to create a fake profile of an attractive woman and talk to him and he unfortunately failed. He said he was single and willing to meet this said woman

He is currently oversees with family. He is notorious for going to strip clubs and getting wasted. 

It is halloween weekend and my friend and I are newly single and freshly 21 and we have not gone out. She says she doesnt want to because he knows hes not very faithful but she can't do the same. She's literally going to break up with him the next day. 

Now.. I have no one to go to the party with LOL

Someone tell me , is my friend acting dumb?!
