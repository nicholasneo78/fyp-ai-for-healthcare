I am 34 year old single mother in a weird relationship and living in a place I can't seem to adjust to and is very far from my home and my family.  I am broke, have hardly any job prospects, and do not own a car.  I do not get along with the father of my daughter and just got swindled by his lawyer so he does not ever have to pay child support (long story).  He's an ass!  I have had 2 abortions and 1 miscarriage in the last three years and am very regretful for them and can't seem to forgive myself.  My parents and I are not speaking due to my mother's alcoholism and my choice to move so far away.  My partner has recently decided he does not want to have any children, which was the straw on the camels back, and on my birthday I had a complete breakdown.  I have had depression for as long as I can remember, along with anxiety. 

Due to these events the last four years, I have just recently dived into the world of antidepressants.  I took Wellbutrin SR 300 mg for about 1 month and it does not seem to do much.  My doctor gave me Cymbalta 30 mg, and it also seems not to do too much.  Not sure if I can combine the two or not.  Does anyone know if you can?  They both decreased my appetite noticeably, but my energy level is still low and and I still feel a little anxious and depressed.  

Anyway, that's a little about me and my situation.
