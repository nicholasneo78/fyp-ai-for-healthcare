i'm not really sure what i want to say here. I was sexually abused by my brother from the age of 4 until i was about 17. He hung himself when i was 20. i'm 34 now and just finding it hard to get a handle on life. I never really thought of what happened to me as being a big deal but my partner has made me think again about what happened in the past. my most formative years were disrupted and i believe i am still suffering as a result.

I suppose i am just wondering if anyone has any advice or knows of anyone who was in a similar situation. I am in counseling at the moment and am just starting to face my demons. I came off my depression / anxiety medications. i felt they were stopping me from really feeling and i felt i needed to be fully aware of my feeling in order to work through this and be able to let go. at the moment i don't see an end to all this.
