I don't know what good being here will do but I NEED someone to talk to. I am so depressed that I am actually crying while I am typing this. I am a single mother of three (one lives with me). I have no job. I have a tremendous amount of clerical skills and am currently in college but I feel like the world is crashing down around me. I have been on Prozac since 1986 because of the loss of both my parents. I have no one to talk to, no friends, no family. I have no one to turn to. I up and left my last job because of a fight between my boss and I. If I get into conflict when I am depressed I run away from things. Now I can not get a job because when they call the job for references, they slam me. I get no child support for my son because if I go to file they will make me pay (I have no income at all except for money that I am able to borrow) my ex because he has two of my kids. (He makes a tremendous amount of money but won't even give me lunch money for our youngest son). I am at the bottom of the tunnel (been here for some time now) and can not see the light. I have been trying and trying to get a job but the door keeps being slammed in my face. I feel like crap and can't cope with it any more.
