I am a 21 year old male, who has been depressed for about two years, ever since I moved to GA from New York. I have social anxiety, and I am a victim of child sex abuse. I have no friends in this state because I was raised in a minority neighborhood, but in this state, there are only a few. Even in New York, I only have two friends, one who has not talked to me since I moved here. There is nothing worth doing or seeing in this place. There are no buses, trains, malls, sidewalks, coliseums, etc ... I am losing my mind. I do not do anything but go online and watch tv all day. Where is the chat room for this site? I clicked Join Live Chat, thinking it was a real chat room.
