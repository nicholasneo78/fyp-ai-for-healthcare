I'm 15 and have been depressed for about a year. i got over it for a little while but now i am back to all the pain. I cut myself for the first time a couple weeks ago and now i can't stop. I always reach for my knife when I'm alone and hurting.

One of my major problems is that I'm really good at hiding my feelings. No one knows that I'm depressed and no one except my best friend knew that i cut myself. I told my best friend because we tell each other everything when I told her the only thing she could say was "you're Crazy" Not exactly the reaction i was expecting especially since she once told me that she cut herself because we got into a huge fight. And even though I knew she was only saying it for attention and she had no scars on her wrist the next day, i still supported her. But now she is turning her back on me. I think she thinks I'm doing it for attention but I'm not. if i were i wouldn't hide the scars under my wrist band and long sleeve shirts. Any way so now i have no one there to talk to. I don't trust anyone anymore and I'm too scared to tell my parents. Even if i did they can't do anything. I have 3 other brothers and my parents don't have the time or money to deal with my problems.

I really scare myself. I have already planned out how I'm going to kill myself if i do and i tempt myself all the time i never have the guts to go through with it all the way but I still try.

I just really need some one to talk to. Someone who will understand where I'm coming from.
