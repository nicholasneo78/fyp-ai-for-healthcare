I found out  I  had depression about 10 years ago. But looking back I had it since i was a teen.

I've tried suicide about 4 times. As you can see that didn't work.

I have 2 kids, one is 21 and the other is 14. I've been married for 11 years this year. They know I have depression, but it's my problem not theirs. I wake up every morning thinking about killing my self and I go to bed thinking about killing myself. I sit around and cry all day. I don't like to leave my house, and I don't unless I really have to. I am overweight, 39, and very alone in this world. My family tries to stay away from me, they don't talk to me unless they have to. My 14 year old is totally afraid of me, I can see it in her eyes. My 21 year old is bipolar, which makes him more screwed up than I am. He throws me into a panic attack every time I get around him. I have been on all of the medications out there, nothing seems to work for me. They just make me sleep a lot. I went to therapy for about 7 years. That really didn't work either. I just started back last month. I hope it helps me this time.
