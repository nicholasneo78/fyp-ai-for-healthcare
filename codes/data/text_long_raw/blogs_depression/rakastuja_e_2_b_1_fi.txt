Why I always let myself fooled... Why I always think there is something more than there really is... I always think I'm good friends with someone and I act accordingly. I try to be that good friend. Then at some point I always realize that it's not a real friendship. The other one didn't think it that seriously. The other one just talked with me because at that time it was fun. It feels crushing. Realizing every single time that the person you took as a good friend, or even possible friend isn't really thinking same about you. Realizing how stupid, silly and naive you have been thinking that you could be a friend for that person. Realizing how they just are amused that you were so deep involved in it.
