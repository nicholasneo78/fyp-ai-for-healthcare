I have always felt different, i guess i am a little weird, loner  gay, but at the same time smart loving, people admire me and respect me . i felt depression back in 96. tried different medications, until, effexor worked for me, then i felt good for several years now depression has come back again, and with much vengeance. it took my soul and mind, I am back with my partner after a short break up which i think caused the monster to come back, i lost motivation in life and i called my ex to come back into my life since i was feeling suicidal, he claims he loves and will be there for me, and he has been a great deal of support for me. i'm taking cymbalta for 4 weeks now but my doctor says it will take 2 more weeks until we decide which medication i should stay with. in the meantime there are suicidal thoughts, running in my head as well as some of hope. i would hate to miss out on my son's high school graduation, or my own graduation from the RN program. as a nurse i know that there is hope, but no matter how much knowledge you have you will always feel lost and helpless when depression is in your body. my message is that we should be patient and continue to do positive things because at the end, all this mess in our heads, will only seem like a period of time where we were sleeping or we blanked out, i am hurting so much and i know there are many more hurting out there, but let's be kind to ourselves and give ourselves words of appreciation and affection, over and over, take care of yourselves and be PATIENT, just like i will be.  God is there watching over us and will not let us perish, unless we want to.
