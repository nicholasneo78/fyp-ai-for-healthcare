Hi, i joined earlier last year in quite a bad state. doubt if anyone will remember me!

I kind of  sort of 'snapped out' of it if that's at all possible. I realized i wasn't just upset, but i was never diagnosed as depressed, so i'm so sorry if I'm offending anyone by posting here. 

But you guys really helped me when i was last here.

From the start of this year i've been so 'down' it's unreal. At first i put it down to stress of january exams but even though the exams are over i am still so miserable (for want of a better word). I have a great boyfriend who i love very much and vice versa. we have been going out for about 6 months and everything is going great, but my moods are starting to put a strain on him (tom).

i have put it down to the fact that I am really low on self esteem at the moment for some reason, but i don't want get up in the morning because i just don't feel i can face anyone. i LOVE shopping, it makes me feel so good, but it doesn't do anything for me now. I get a bit of Seasonal Affective Disorder, and even sun showers haven't cheered me up.

Because i'm so down i've become really irritable lately, like permanent PMT and like i said, i think its really starting to put pressure on tom, because he's always on the receiving end of my moods.

I don't want to mess everything up or slip too far down the depression road again.

I just don't know what to do or how to explain things to tom (my boyfriend).

Any words of wisdom you could offer me? i think things really might be in trouble.
