I'm a hetero man, 35, divorced, no kids. I can honestly say that I feel empathy towards any guy who suffers from depression. Some of my closest guy friends have admitted to me their many bouts of battling these demons, just as I've shared my horror stories and near suicidal incidents, and we all have empathy with each other over that stuff. I'm beginning to not give a crap anymore about depression being viewed as just a "woman" issue; it is what it is and to heck with gender stereotypes. The things I've noticed the most are my friends' unwillingness to consult a therapist or take medication, but perhaps their bouts of depression are not the "bed-ridden" variety that I have gone through. Or maybe this is their way of not feeling "completely weak". Most of my friends will either drink excessively or take drugs to deal with this stuff. I tried to drink it all away, but in the end it just made me feel worse. I tried tranquilizers, but that didn't work. I tried booze and pills together, but still the depression lingered. Now I just smoke cigarettes and go running (what a dichotomy, I know) but whatever works, right? The only woman I've ever known who isn't empathetic or sympathetic to my depression is my mother.
