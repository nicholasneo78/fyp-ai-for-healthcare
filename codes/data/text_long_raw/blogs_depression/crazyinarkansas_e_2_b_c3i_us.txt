First I want to introduce myself, I live in Arkansas I am 39 and a mom to 4 (18, 15, 8 and 3) I have been on and off different antidepressants for almost 4 years. Started out with celexa after I had my last baby, went through some ppd and haven't been the same since. I was on celexa for 14 months then stopped for 7 months, then went back on it and totally had a bad reaction. Then came zoloft, that lasted about 3 months sent me in to some sort of mania, then there was wellbutrin, wanted to drive off the road in to the lake on that, then came effexor which I thought worked but apparently I also was going through rapid cycling, I kind of liked that. I spent 3 months on that and about a month on the wellbutrin. Then came paxil cr, was on that for 6 months but I just cant get past these mood swings and outbursts. So now I have been on Lexapro for almost 3 months, today the doctor decided to increase me to 20 mg and add lamictal for my mood swings. I am a little nervous about starting this new one. This rash I hear about sounds scary. I also take 1 mg of klonopin as needed(everyday)
I just wonder if I will ever feel the same again, but then it has been so long that I don't know if I would even know what that feels like. Sorry to ramble on, but that's my story. I am to start the lamictal tonight. wish me luck!!
If anyone has any input for me I would really appreciate it
