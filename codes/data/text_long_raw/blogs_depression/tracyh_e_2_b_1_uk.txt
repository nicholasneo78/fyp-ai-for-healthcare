Hi I am Tracy and I have had depression and anxiety for about 10years.I am 35 and a wife and mum to 3 beautiful kids who deserve a mum who isn't ill. The biggest thing that gets me so frustrated with myself is the way depression makes me feel such a weak person, before I was ill I had a job, was the strong one where friends and family were concerned and basically could cope with whatever life threw at me .Now I am lucky if I can cope with getting through the day. I am on Efexor xl at the moment and have been for about a year. It is so nice to post this and not worry about being judged, it is lovely to know that other people understand. Well that's me
