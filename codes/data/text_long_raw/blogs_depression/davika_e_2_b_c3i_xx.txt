I have never chatted on a chat line before. So please bear with me. I'm 29 years old married with three children. In the last 12 months I have lost my grandmother in September 2004, my father in February 2005, gave birth to a baby girl in May 2005, and now lost my only aunt which was just like a mother to me.  The way I feel now scares me.  I thought after I lost my grandma and dad I held it together pretty good, but after my aunt died I felt like I lost everything.  I have always been a very strong person someone other people leaned on. Now I literally can't get out of bed, I don't want to talk to anyone, or see anyone.  My mind feels like it is racing with things i have to do like cook, clean, pay bills, tend to my children, but i just can't do anything.  I even quit my job because i simply felt i couldn't go to work.  I would just like to know what is happening.
