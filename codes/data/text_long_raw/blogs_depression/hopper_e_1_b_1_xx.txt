I think letters are a wonderful way to communicate. That way you don't say anything without thinking about it first. I wasn't clear if your mother actually read the letter or not. If she hasn't, I might suggest approaching the letter with just the first issue of the way she treats you (without the father issue) in one letter. That might open dialogue and allow you guys to focus on fixing that first. I understand your fear of authority figures. When I was that age (I'm 31 now) I couldn't talk to anyone of authority. My mom, who was shy herself had to do that kind of stuff for me. Could another one of your relatives go with you to take your drivers test? Nana or Sonny who you mentioned in the letter? If it helps to hear, I did get over my fear of authority figures and sometimes I go overboard and challenge them (to make up for lost time?). I never had psychotherapy, but I wish I had. So don't discount it, nip it in the bud if you are able to. One other question I have is...is your mother ALWAYS this way or does she show moments of tenderness, sympathy or interest in your life? I think that if you've seen the mom in her in the past, it sounds like she has some internal problems that she takes out on you, but have nothing to do with you. Don't worry about how you should be at this age...everyone has their own time clock inside. If we were all the same, this would be a very very boring world. You sound like an interesting, thoughtful man. I wish you could see that.
