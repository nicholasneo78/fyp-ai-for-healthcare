From the life I know. All I can say is, I know that after all we have been through. AND without preaching I know that you know that whatever your children choose in the path to lead you will support. BUT and HOWEVER I have many friends from all walks of life. And we all share the same childhood in more ways than not. And in any case, not one of our childhoods has sculpted who we are today, some of us on one side of the line some on the other... My father while eating dinner with my brother and I for the first time in years last night while meeting new friends and people made a very correct statement.. While my little brother is the "marine" and I being whatever I might be am the emotional one, (THIS IS TRUE) and yet my father has NO clue about my emotional status, issues what not... Just because one is emotional does not mean that his path is chosen. I'm going to stop being politically correct and y'all know what I mean :) :) or at least I hope so. I guess as I have lost my train of thought (crazy in the brain?) All I can say is just make sure that the kids grow up and learn to take care of themselves, never to rely on someone else to always make sure that they are taken care of.... In essence learn to wipe your own ass or you're going to be sorry because one day that ass wiper is going to be gone.. Keep being the parent you are and you will "all" make it out ok! That I can promise... I'm only 24 years old and I have friends across the planet from all walks of life... This I can tell you true...
