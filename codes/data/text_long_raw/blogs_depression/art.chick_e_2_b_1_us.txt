Yep - I know this all too well. And it is a sad state of affairs. But you are aware of it. Best you know what is going on than be surprised. SN, I hear what you are saying about not being able to weather another strike against your stability now. And I hope you do not have to go. I will pray with you that you are spared from the cuts this time, but while you are praying and hoping, consider the issue of your personal power. If you are feeling shaky in other areas of life, I doubt that you feel that you have any. I have been in that situation over many things. Remember the difference between what you DO have control over and what you do NOT have control over: you can control the way you approach this job, your punctuality, your diligence, your politeness to other workers; you CANNOT control the decisions made on the top and how they will affect your status. I have been reading a book called "Corporate Confidential" by Cynthia Shapiro. She was an HR manager for her whole life and spills the beans on how companies decide who will stay and who will go. It was an eye-opener for me. Perhaps it can help you at this juncture. In your own prayers, remember to ask God not just for the optimal decision to be made on your behalf, but for the power to see where you do and do not have control and for help taking charge of the areas that you actually can control. When you are in a phase of instability, it seems that more and more garbage gets thrown your way. But a turning point comes when the indignation of being tossed on everyone else's sea propels you into action. That turning point came for me about 9 years ago when a really awful roommate had to be ejected. I felt a power I had never felt before - the ability to take charge of my own life, not waiting for someone else's decision to tell me whether I was going to be OK or not. I am trying to find my way back to that point. I hope you do too. It can happen.
