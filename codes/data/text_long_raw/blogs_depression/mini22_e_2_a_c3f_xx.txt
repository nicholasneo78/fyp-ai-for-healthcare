My name is Jessica. I'm 21 years old and my boyfriend and I have just broken up after 2 years. I'm not sure where to begin ... our bickering and fighting started about a year ago and even though it was always small stupid things we were fighting about I guess it all built up in the end ... 

I know it's probably for the best but I love him and hate the thought of losing him ... he means the world to me ... I just feel like things will take so long to get back to normal with me, especially because we are living together ... I'm in college hence living in student apartments ... I don't want him to move out because i don't want to be totally alone here .. I'm going to miss him and his stupid and crazy ways but most of all his company (when we weren't fighting , or when he was over reacting about things!!!!!!!!) I just don't know what to do at the moment.

I'm sure in a few months i'll move on but I'll never get over it.

he said he still loves me and that maybe in a few months or years we might get back together because he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life with anyone else but me, but i just cant deal at the moment. I'm beginning to think from reading other messages that i may be really slightly depressed or anxious or something ....

a lot has happened in my life and he knows it all ... i just didn't know who i can really talk to about such personal issues anymore ...
