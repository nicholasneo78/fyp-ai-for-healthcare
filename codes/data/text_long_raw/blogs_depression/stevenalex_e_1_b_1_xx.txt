I definitely think your right that my anxiety has sought out a fear that I dread more than any other and it is true that when I am not feeling depressed ( which incidentally is most of the time. This is only my second spell of depression in 39 years of life) I can mull over these thoughts and not be troubled with them in the slightest. It's really horrible how anxiety can feed off itself and lead you down this path to terrible thoughts. By the way when my partner was pregnant with our first child she to had dreams like yours and she was upset by them and she like you has turned out to be an attentive and first class mother.
