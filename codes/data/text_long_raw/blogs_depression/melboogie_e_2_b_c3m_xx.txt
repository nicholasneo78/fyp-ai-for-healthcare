I have now had BAD night sweats on and off for about 4 years. I am only 32, so it's not menopause and at this point I am pretty sure they are from my antidepressants. I have now tried about 4 - 5 different antidepressants to try to get rid of them but nothing has worked. About 4 years ago I got night sweats when I tried Zoloft which is known for causing them, so I switched to Prozac which never caused them and I was fine, for awhile. Then one day I just started getting night sweats and over the years I tried to get rid of them by switching to Wellbutrin, Effexor, Serzone (I think) and Cymbalta to no avail. My night sweats get worse depending on the season and humidity. At their worst, which as been for the past 2 weeks since the weather change, I am soaked all night, clothing, sheets, pillows, blankets - everything. Then I freeze when I get up to change my clothes or go to the bathroom because I am soaking wet.

I am basically at the end of my rope. I no longer know what to do and my doctor's just choked it up to my antidepressants so they say there is nothing I can do.

Has anybody gone through this and found a solution? Help please.
