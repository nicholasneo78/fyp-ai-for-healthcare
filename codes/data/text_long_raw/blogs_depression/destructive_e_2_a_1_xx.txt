Ok here goes. I actually feel like I don't deserve to be looking at this site. I've been sitting here all morning reading through everyone's posts and have been think that I have no right to hate my life. I have a good family, friends and have had experiences other 20yr olds would only dream of. But there is something in my head telling me that my life sucks and nobody cares if I am here or not. Then the real me kicks back in and I think I am stupid for thinking that. STUPID. Stupid for thinking I have no purpose. So that makes me feel even worse. I fear. I don't know. Being alone and rejected I guess. I don't do I often but when I am having a 'fat week' I have purged and over exercised. I don't know if this is because I really think I am fat or. I don't know why else, but I am not overweight. I have never told any one any of this in person. I can't do it. I hate sympathy. When I am around my friends I am totally the opposite. I am so hyper and half the time it is not even an act sometimes I just can't control. Other times I do have to put it on just so that don't ask me if anything's up but I have never failed to fool them. Anyway that's enough
