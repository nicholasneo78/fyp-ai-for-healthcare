My name is Maria, I'm 37 and have social anxiety plus some traits of borderline personality disorder.  I've been taking Prozac for the last eight years and have been seeing a psychiatrist that whole time.  Next week I have an appointment with a therapist (I have only had random therapy sessions during this time).

What I'm really struggling with right now is how I am still single after all these years.  I'll go out with someone about a half a dozen times and then they lose interest, or as the last person said, I freaked him out (really I think he overreacted to a couple of incidents, but I guess if he was freaked out, who am I to argue?)  In 2002 my best friend / ex died in my condo from years of drug / alcohol abuse ... he was going through a rough period at the time, but I really think we would have ended up together .... since then I have had a hard time connecting with anyone else on the same level.

Does anyone else find that people they date are scared off?  Every time someone breaks it off with me, I get very discouraged and that much more "jaded" ... with this last person, I even took a day off from work.  Anyone else go through this?
