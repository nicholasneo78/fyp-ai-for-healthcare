On Monday I plan to finally go and get help from a Doctor but I still haven't told anyone I know how I'm feeling. It's not because I don't want to it's just because I'm scared my parents won't take me seriously or think they have done something wrong bring me up. To tell you the truth I couldn't care what other people think of me but I'm just really worried what my family will think. I'm the oldest of 3 and when I was at school my dad pushed me hard to do well in studies and all that crap but now I'm older and have done nothing at all with my life I still don't know what to do with it. I was even at college for a year but quit after a year because I couldn't seam to keep up no matter what I did. Anyway I'm totally going off the point, I was just wondering if anyone would share with me how they managed to tell there parents? May sound stupid but this is just the hardest thing for me to do but I feel I really need to if I ever want to get over this!
