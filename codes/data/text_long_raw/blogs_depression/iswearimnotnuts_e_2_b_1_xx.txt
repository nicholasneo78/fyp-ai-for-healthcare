Hello. I am a 40 year-old woman, and I'm feeling quite lost right now. I've always been sort of depressed, but have never been given a formal diagnosis. That may change tomorrow. I have an appointment with a shrink. My psychiatrist put me on Prozac 3 years ago. I was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 34, and needed some help getting past that. I am adopted (a biggie for relationship issues), was married at the age of 18, had 3 kids by the time I was 40, and I'm having a hard time transitioning to my new stage in life (sort of empty nest syndrome, I guess) I should be thrilled with my life. I make oodles of money, my kids are all fairly successful & just about on their own, but I'm miserable. My husband and I are in a sort of "friendship" relationship, I could care less if he stays or goes. I started having panic attacks after my 40th birthday few weeks ago; I actually thought I was having a heart attack. So now, I'm on 30 mg Prozac & .05 Klonadine (1/2 pill at a time) 3 times a day. I can't quit crying. So... how long does a psychology test take. How long will it take for them to diagnose me with something? These drugs aren't doing a whole lot. Any help would be appreciated.
