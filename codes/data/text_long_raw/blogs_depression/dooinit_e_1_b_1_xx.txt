I've been reading the "hoarding" thread in the OCD forum and I'm jealous. They're having fun bonding by sharing stories about their habits, so I thought we could do some of that with plain old depressives. Sometimes when I'm depressed, I realize that I'm crying over something so stupid that I have to step back and laugh at how upset I've gotten over dumb things. I can't remember all of them, but here are some of the "highlights" on the list of Silly Things That Made Starry kitten Cry: my boyfriend told me his cat was giving me a "mean look" I set out a pack of Marshmallow Peeps to get nice and crispy in the open air and my roommate threw them out. (Oh, there were tears!). The coffeehouse was out of soymilk on a day I really wanted some soy hot chocolate. What's on your list?
