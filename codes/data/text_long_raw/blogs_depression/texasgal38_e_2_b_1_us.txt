I'm new to these boards and I hope I'm posting in the right spot...I have been diagnosed with major recurring depression since 1992. I have a host of chronic, painful auto-immune related diseases. I am also trying to care for an ill family member who just got out of the hospital and had major surgery (takes a year to recover from this surgery). This family member is pretty much bedridden and needs to be bathed, fed, and cared for much the way a private duty nurse would. It is a daunting task for me under the circumstances. Insurance will not pay for long term care and we cannot afford even the cheapest of help. Hence, I am managing all of it alone. Once in a blue moon, my in-laws will help but are very resentful on the rare occasion that I ask for help. My house is cluttered (I saw that topic) and I'm not sure if its because I'm so depressed or because I have been sick too much to take care of it. I think perhaps its both. I know that at least some of my depression is situational, but I also know that some of it is not. I am on medication, but the medicines have never done a whole lot for me. I've tried them all. I was found to be "resistant" to medication. Whatever that means. I was hospitalized for a 3 month period in the 1990's for suicide attempts. I guess what brought me here is that I feel like I'm about to "crack" and am trying to find a way to avoid that. I am hoping to get past this pain caused by this disease I have so that I can get the energy back that I need to unclutter my house, have a genuine smile on my face when handling my nursing duties and get a hold on my life in general.
