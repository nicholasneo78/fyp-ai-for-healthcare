I have just registered and thought I would introduce myself. I posted this in a different place but thought I would put it here too. I hope that is ok. I am Chris, female, age 50. I was diagnosed with depression 8 years ago following the sudden death of my best friend. I was doing ok and learning to live with it when my son, my only child, was killed by a drunk driver on Christmas Eve 2003. My world has collapsed. I was of work for 8 months but eventually returned there part time, and have been coping in my own way until the turn of the year when I had another breakdown. I am still off and isolating. I don't open the curtains; don't answer the door or the phone. Some days I can't see an end to it. To top that, my partner left around the same time because he said he couldn't live with my depression any more. I can't say I blame him. I wouldn't live with me either given the choice. I joined because it seems like a very supportive place, and I noticed you have a forum for grief which I think I could benefit from if allowed access. I sometimes think I'm going mad without my son, and no-one understands the way it is for me. Hopefully I will meet some of you soon. Take care all.
