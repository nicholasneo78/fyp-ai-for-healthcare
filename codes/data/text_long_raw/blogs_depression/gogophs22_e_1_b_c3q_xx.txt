I have been recently released from the hospital after a failed suicide attempt.  I am trying to learn how to cope with things and I recently found out that my wife has disclosed the fact that I attempted suicide to many people (about 8) that I really do not know, nor do I feel comfortable with them knowing.  As a matter of fact, I'm very upset about this.

For a little background my wife and i have not had the best relationship for the past 2 - 3 years.  about 18 months ago we moved back to her hometown after I lost my job and she could advance in her career where we are now.  I really don't have any friends down here and have lost contact with my old friends.

I have told 3 people that I attempted suicide (mom, dad, brother) and i knew that her family knew (mom, dad, 2 sisters)  Now my wife tells me that she needed to deal with what I have done and she has told many of her coworkers.  She couldn't talk about this with her family or with her high school friends (which are still in the area, and I have known about 8 years).  She had to tell people that she knows I don't know very well, and of what I do know, I don't like very much.  Now my wife wants me to do more things with her coworkers and I feel very uncomfortable around them.

Am I being too sensitive about this?  Not realizing my wife's needs?  Or am I justified in my being upset?

I will not be able to come back to this board until Monday (tomorrow) evening so I can't post any replies until then.
