Just some curious questions here. I am recently undergoing lots of stress in my life. My work is failing and I am struggling keeping up. I recently have a new born in the family as well and extra workload at home too. I noticed these few symptoms:1) Often worrying, going in a loop worrying even about small things 2) Very easily agitated, get angry very easy 3) Weird sleeping pattern, can't sleep at night and sleep 10-12 hours straight during the day 4) Hard to concentrate at anything serious, easily distracted 5) Have up and down moments, sometimes it feels as though nothing has happened, sometimes it hits hard and I could waste one whole day just sitting at home being totally non productive. 6) Easily give up at everything I do, everything seems to be hopeless at times. I am putting off going to the doctors for a long time now. I previously been to the doctors and was given 2 different kind of antidepressants and I really felt awful taking them and stopped. I am reluctant going back because of the same reason. Is this a serious matter that warrants me to see the doctor again? Just hate the feeling but I noticed the "downs" have been coming on more and more lately due to more stress load. Please advice, and if possible give some advice concerning the medication I am most likely to be given if I go to the doctors as well...thank you.
