I'm 19 an architectural student life's meant to be all great right? everything in my life is so good but I'm always depressed and sometimes i go throw these stages where i cry out of nowhere for no particular reason! i used to cut myself and i really need to but my insecurities about my scars are holding me back i need to find happiness soon or I'm just going to give up on life I'm thinking way too far into the danger zone and almost suicidal! great here i go again bloody crying! well I'm just looking for some around my age who can relate and who i can talk to! and I'm a great listener so if there's anyone out there?
