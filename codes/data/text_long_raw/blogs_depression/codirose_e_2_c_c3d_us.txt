I haven't been on this site for awhile because everything was going pretty good! Tonight it's all falling down though.  I don't even know what to say right now. I've just got to pound this keyboard. There's so much to say but I can't get it out correctly. Pretty pathetic when I can't even say anything but leave me alone. I sure wish there was someone to talk to. Someone to yell at, you know? Just to yell. Around my neighborhood it would be a sign of "not all there", you know? I finally see how a few of the people around here drive their cars off the cliff. It's almost spring, about another month to month and a half. If I can just wait that long, I can get out into the yard with the sun and feel better. I have to keep thinking of that, the sun and yard, something to look forward to.  My "feel good" days must have been pretty good because this downfall is pretty lousy. So lousy that I try to feel what I had been feeling, but it's almost like I can't remember it. Already!
