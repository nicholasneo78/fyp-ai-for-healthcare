Do therapy sessions work?
I’m 18F, I’m really unhappy with existing. I constantly feel low, I have no social life or friends, even when I did - I had no interest in going out. I’ve recently gone through a breakup and it’s made everything worse, my heart feels like it can’t take no more. And I’ve got classes everyday which I don’t want to do. I’m just sticking in it for the last 6 months. 

I don’t feel any joy anymore, should I see a GP? Do therapy sessions work? I don’t see what they could tell me that I already know, exercise, go out and do things - talk about how I’m feeling. I’m pretty self aware. 

What are things you’ve done that have worked?
