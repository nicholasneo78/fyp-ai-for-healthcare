My cat just got hit by a car
I can't even think about it too much. My family is a little sad but are kinda telling me to get over it. I've been in such a terrible depressive spell for the last few weeks and this just ruined everything. When older pets die by natural causes I don't cry as much as because I know we gave them the best life and they lived very long but my suki was only 2 years old she was so fat and adorable and I can't believe she is gone just because of a bad driver. She always came to me when I was upset she'd lay on top of me and snuggle. I wish I had more time with her. now I have almost nothing that makes me smile
