I love you all
Sometimes that is all we need to hear to help us push through. Everyday is a challenge and a struggle but we get through it however we can. 
That's true strength. 
I love all of you amazing people who fight every second of everyday. You are not worthless or weak, you are brave, important and loved. 
If anyone ever wants to talk, rant, be friends, PM me and I will be there. 


My day hasn't been great but soon bed time to start again tomorrow.
