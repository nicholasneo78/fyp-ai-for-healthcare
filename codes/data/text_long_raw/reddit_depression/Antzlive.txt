Has anyone been depression free for 5+ years?
I get better then I get much worse, it's a cycle that won't stop. I'm wondering if there any older redditors that had severe depression as a young adult, and are now completely free from it? Depression is almost certainly going to kill me, whether it's the harmful way I cope to stay alive day to day, or more directly if I by some miracle can get my hands on a gun. 

Is there anyone that has been cured and not worries about depression creeping back? How did you do it?
