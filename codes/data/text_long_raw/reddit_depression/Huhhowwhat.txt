Sometimes I just get hit so hard by realizing I've lost out on most of my life. "Castle on the hill" got me messed up
Don't know why the song suddenly got to me, I've heard and seen it before but now it makes me so sad. I never had that, I don't have friends I could go to, get back to, I just have nobody. After half of my life I wouldn't say I'm depressed anymore, but now I have to deal with the fallout of years and years and years of digging myself in a hole, I have to start everything over. I have no foundation to build on. I feel sad, maybe a little fearful that I will never manage to achieve that genuine bonding and feeling of belonging I could have gotten in my teens. 
    
I'm proud I'm still here, I'm proud I've come so far, but right now I'm incredibly disheartened and I don't know how to process this sadness.
Edit: everything seems suddenly so meaningless and fake
