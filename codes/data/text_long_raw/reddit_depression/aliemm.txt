Bursting into tears at pigeon dying
So one effect of my depression is I get really, really, really sad about some things.
I just saw a pigeon get hit by the bus I’d just gotten off of; when I went to help it, it got hit by another car and I head it’s skull smash. 
I am absolutely devastated and can’t stop myself crying at work.
