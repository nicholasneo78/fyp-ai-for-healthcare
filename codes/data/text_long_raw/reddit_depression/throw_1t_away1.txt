Reluctant to get diagnosed
I'm reluctant to go to the doctor and find out if I have depression. I can't exactly explain this, but it's a combination of a few things. Part of me feels that I'm asking to be depressed and another part of me fears that I don't have depression and my problems are all just my own fault.
