Ashamed of being depressed.
I've never been "diagnosed" with depression but I think that I'm there.

Girlfriend decided she needed "space" so that took me down more, found a car I really wanted but after days of number crunching I decided I couldn't afford, my exiting car and house repairs keep racking up. I have few friends and live alone.

Honestly I feel bad every day. I get to work an hour late and dread it, for no reason. It's not hard and I generally enjoy it while I'm there. I feel almost certain that I'm depressed, but why? I feel bad about that. I own my own house, my own car, and have no real money problems, yet I feel like shit constantly. My sister is a recovering addict. I've seen how low people can go, yet I'm not even close. I've generally been lucky and have done reasonably well for myself, yet I still feel down. No real life partner to speak of, very few friends. But I feel that being upset and down about it is wrong because so many people have it so much worse.

Is that wrong? I dunno. This week has been very bad for me.
