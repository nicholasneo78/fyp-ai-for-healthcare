Everything has changed...
 About four years ago I was the typical loner. I was in the middle school. Nobody took me seriously, because my hobbies were not shared by anyone else. I'm from a small town, so it was difficult for me to find someone who actually liked the things I did. At the time I liked things like anime, video games and MLP. I am a 19 year old lass now and I only like video games now. 

  In the final grade of my middle school I met a girl. She was about two years younger but liked the same things I did. I was so happy to finally meet someone like me. We have bonded a lot and she was the first person I truly loved, except for my family, of course. 

 About two years ago we started to get distant. She kept talking to me about things I was uncomfortable with, but whenever I tried to talk about something that bothered me, she told me she was busy and didn't hear me out. It escalated in June of 2016. 

  I started talking to her friends, because they seemed like such wonderful people to me. Then we met up, all of us. She kept crying and making scenes. Few weeks before that, she accused me of liking HER friends more than I liked her. But when we all met, it seemed alright, save for her crying etc...  

  When I got home the next day, she told me off. Really badly. She told me to go to hell, called me all sorts of names and I feared... I feared I would never be able to find someone like her again. 

  I tried to end it. Swallowed sleeping pills and drank alcohol. I woke up the next day in a hospital. I woke up to a text from her. One that said she wishes my mother was torn apart by the girl's dogs...

 It's been two years. I've gotten better, met friends that helped me out a lot and I will probably never be able to repay it. But this past of mine, it still haunts me. I don't think I'll ever be able to trust someone like this again. I have gotten so cynical and careless about everything... It still hurts.
