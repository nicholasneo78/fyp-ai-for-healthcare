Wishing I could cry, but can't
It's really hard, trying to sit, and think about something, and having that feeling where you want to cry, but the tears just won't come out.

The worst thing about this is that my day was going well. I don't have any issues.

Why do I feel like this? Makes the day look useless, makes my life look useless.
