No end in sight
I have been depressed for so long.  I just feel a void,dark and empty.  I can  feel the pain of no one loving me. I have zero friends.  I live with toxic parents .I feel like i have been in an endless loop with   no end in sight to the pain I'm in.  I hate my existence. I have done therapy,yoga blah blah. I still feel miserable. I am so unlucky. Can't do anything right.  What's the point if you're not good at anything. Im  below average in life,no money,No job,No talent and no interest. I don't get it.  Why am I even here?
