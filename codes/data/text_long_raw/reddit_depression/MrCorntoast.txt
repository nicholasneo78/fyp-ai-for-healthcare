Feelings of isolation, even among friends
How do you deal with the feeling that you don't belong anywhere? That no one ever understands you? I always feel this way around everyone and every group I'm in. Family gatherings, movies, friend parties, etc.

It can't possibly be true that no one understands me, so I must be actively trying to sabotaging myself by distinguishing every aspect of myself apart from everyone in every instance. 

It makes me feel so alone, what do you guys think?
