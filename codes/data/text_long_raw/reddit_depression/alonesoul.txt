Cold turkey off antidepressants for over a month.
Iâ€™ve been cold turkey from my antidepressants for over a month. Sounds stupid to say that I completely forgot to take them for two weeks but I have been doing so many different jobs over the summer that Iâ€™ve hardly been home. For the first couple of weeks, I was fine. Now as time has gone on, the suicidal thoughts have returned along with extremely low moments, mania and anxiety attacks. I would NOT recommend going cold turkey. I canâ€™t believe I have been THAT stupid. Iâ€™ve just taken my first antidepressant just now. ðŸ˜ž
