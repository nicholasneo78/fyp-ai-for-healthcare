i hate my autistic sister and mentally ill mom and i hate myself for that
i feel trapped my sister is 20 years old and on the autism spectrum she’s not severe enough to where it’s obvious she just seems like a really weird awkward person, she’s in college, she has no friends, she has the most severe anxiety and depression i’ve ever seen in someone she can’t get a job and when she does she gets fired i feel like this all falls onto me, the 14 year old younger sister im so mean to her and i don’t try to be but i feel like i’m her primary care taker. my mother has severe mental illness issues and has recently harmed herself badly, she’s attempted suicide and been admitted into a mental hospital in recent years. all of her problems fall on me as well she tells me everything she sobs to me and tells me she’s a horrible mother, that she hates herself, that she’s going to blow her brains out, her and my father fight constantly and this helps nothing. i feel so mean towards both my mom and my sister but i’m so trapped by them they both confide in me and i’m just a kid i can’t help them. this is probably in the wrong sub but i didn’t know where to put it i’m sorry i just needed to tell someone i deal with this all on my own, i have no friends and i don’t want to trouble my boyfriend with my hefty issues. i just lay around and sulk all day i’m so saddened by my family i don’t know what to do i think i may be depressed i just want some help i’m so stuck. im trapped
