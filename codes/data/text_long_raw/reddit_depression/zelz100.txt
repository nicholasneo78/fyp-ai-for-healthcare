Psychiatrist of 6 years terminated me as a patient and is refusing refills of Lamictal because I went to outpatient rehab?
I have been going to the same psychiatrist for 6 years.  I have been on a high dose of Lamictal for 6 years to treat bipolar disorder.  I have gone to regular appointments and have had consistent refills.

I had a period of intense depression in which I went on a one month drinking binge and went to a hospital where I was given Ativan to deal with the withdrawal.  It wasn't a consistent prescription, just enough pills to ween off the withdrawal and ensure I wouldn't relapse back to drinking.

My psychiatrist just called me and told me she is terminating me as a patient and is unable to see me or refill my lamictal because I was prescribed Ativan by another physician.  I am freaking out about the effects of stopping this cold turkey.  I only took the Ativan for one week, two months ago.  I just want to have my lamictal refilled.  I need a refill this week, I can't find a new psychiatrist in time.

How is this allowed?  I sought emergency treatment for a substance abuse issue and am being unsafely yanked off a medicine I've been on my entire adult life.

Help please
