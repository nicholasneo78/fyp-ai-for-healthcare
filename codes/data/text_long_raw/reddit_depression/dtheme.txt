That feeling of good at night, dread in morning
I feel good in the evenings, planning etc.

Come the next morning it's dread and anxiety.

Always had it but in the last three years I've been hit with health, friendship and security issues.

It's definitely aggravated this feeling.

I have to travel to different places for work. But I dread it now.

I'm not in the position to get therapy. I know the issues, not much more than others out there. I've always just kept busy and got on with things. But this dread is getting much worse.

I read it has something to do with the brain not wanting to change all the time. Going places etc. Plus health, security etc. So it makes sense my brain is telling me not to go places.

But, this is life and I need to work. No choice.

Theses days if something negative happens I tumble rapidly. If something positive I inch up a little. Something is not right. 

Just wondering how people cope with this?
