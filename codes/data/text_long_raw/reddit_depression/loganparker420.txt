Lost my dad and my pet within the last two weeks.
We took my dad to the hospital and found out he had a tumor in his colon. They removed it and several surgeries later he was in recovery, eating, and ready to come home. My mom spent day and night by his side for over a month at the hospital and refused to leave his side.

Finally he was recovering and they told her she can go home since they're transferring him to a hospital closer to us. She comes home and the next morning we find out he died in his sleep from a heart attack. After surviving all the surgeries, he dies alone the same night my mom went home.

On top of that, we didn't get along well. I'm not even sure he knew I cared about him. All the responsibilities fell on me since both my parents were gone for a month. I didn't have time to drive to the hospital he was at.

We had his memorial service and funeral.. then things started to calm down. My mom and I spent time making the house spotless and reorganizing. I woke up this morning to find out that the cat I've had for 6-7 years got hit by a car. I buried him in a box outside our house and now I'm just laying here, wondering if it's going to get any worse before it gets better.
