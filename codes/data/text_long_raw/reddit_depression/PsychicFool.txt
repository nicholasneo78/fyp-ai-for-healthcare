Dropping by to mention you should take some Vitamin D supplements.
Of course, check with your doctor. Etc. etc. 

Vitamin D is the sunshine pill that most people are deficient in. This is also much more of an issue in colder areas or for those who cover up from the sun often. The best way to get vitamin D is through certain food combinations and routines in sitting in delicate morning sunlight and in most cases, taking a supplement is necessary to keep this vitamin flowing in your body. 

Vitamin D is best absorbed with calcium, so if youâ€™re taking a supplement, finding foods, or sitting in the sun consider to add the calcium as well. 

You will find that your mood will be better or more stable with vitamin D consumption.

Make sure to strive for a more regulated sleeping schedule as well and something to keep your mind stimulated without an electronic screen. 


I may have butchered a lot of this vitamin D thing so please take the time to read this:
