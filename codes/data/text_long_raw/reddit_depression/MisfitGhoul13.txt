Dear depression,
please please let me be. I know I can do so much good and actually get somewhere in life but you are constantly holding me down, suffocating me. Once I think I've escaped your grip you show me you never let go and I'm reminded of how tightly we are woven together. I can't breathe. I can't eat. I can't sleep. all I want is some peace. you creep into my bedroom at night when you know I'm alone. you destroy everything inside me until I'm just a hollow shell of a small sad girl. why?! why can't you let me be? let me succeed? you bring fear, doubt, guilt, all the bad thoughts. I run and fight for the little bit of light I see through my window in the morning. but every night you are back. sometimes you don't even leave and it can be days, weeks, months til I get another chance at seeing the light. This is not living, this is not a life i wish my son's to see in me. You have taken me from myself. it isn't fair. I just want to be free of your poison. I need an escape from the never-ending torment that you bring. please please, just let me be. :"(
