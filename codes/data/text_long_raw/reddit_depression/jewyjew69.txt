The Last of Us
I just finished my second playthrough, PS3 (im poor, sue me bitch). after the part with the cannibals, ellie sat on a bench and didn't talk much. this, in combination with when she says "he tried to..." to joel after she kills david, made me get a bit angry and sad. then i thought about my female friends (few as they may be) and family and how if any ever hurt them in such a way, especially my family, well i think it's better if that's left unsaid. had to pause the game for a min to cry. i never thought i'd be so depressed that a video game could make me cry (and i've played a lot of games, over 1,200 trophies on PSN. only this one made me cry). and in retrospect, i now think i've come to appreciate at least one aspect of my depression: emotion and the appreciation of it. sometimes i can look at someone, there body language, listen to them and feel there pain, suffering and sadness. i now appreciate The Last of Us, life and other people more. although i did feel more alone afterwards (especially since i think it'd be wonderful to find a girl that has a personality like ellie's. never had a gf, had any physical romantic interaction with a girl or even been on a date. i was 12 when the game was released and will probably still be 16 when part 2 comes out, so we ain't dealin with no pedo shit in these christian suburbs) it was definitely worth it.

 -just thought i'd share that in the hopes that it would brighten someone's day. I love you all, stay safe.
