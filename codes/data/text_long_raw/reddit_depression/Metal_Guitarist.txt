Does anyone else get very irritable whenever you're hungry?
The biggest problem in my life is that I get extremely irritable when I'm hungry. I'll find myself fantasizing about getting in argument or getting mad about something and then kinda snap out of it and realize I'm actually just hungry. Then I get something to eat and I can feel some of the stress melting away, taking deep breaths and shit. This happens every day.

This makes me pretty cranky while I'm making something to eat in the kitchen. If anyone tries to talk to me I just want nothing to do with them until I get some food in me. It's putting a real strain on some of my relationships.

I'm struggling with this because it's really hard to balance not overeating with not being irritable. I don't really know whats going on.
