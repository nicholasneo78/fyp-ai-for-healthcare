How do I stop running away from problems or escape from them?
All I do is pile my problems onto future me and live in the present, staying at home all day being depressed, which is still the 'happiest' that I can be. Inevitably I will have to face the consequences of the stacks of work I've neglected, but is there just some way for me to get out of this loop? I don't know what to do, especially when all I want is to be miserable and depressed until I kill myself. Help
