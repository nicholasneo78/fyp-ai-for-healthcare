do therapists tell your parents about you diagnosis?
apologies if this isn't a good place to ask. I'm a minor and I'm going to have therapy soon, and I'm very nervous. I likely have social anxiety and have no clue what to say. but besides that, my parents are probably the main reason for my depression, and Id much prefer if they didn't know. does the therapist have to tell them, legally? or by policy or something? will they not if I ask them not to? thank you.
