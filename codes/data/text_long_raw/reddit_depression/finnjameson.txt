She stopped texting back
Hi, i'm 19 and for as long as I remember I have always struggled with self-confidence and my depression. I rarely use tinder because I don't match with many people, I'm below average looking like but it doesn't help swiping for ages and rarely getting a match. 

I know it's just a glorified hook up app for the most part but the other night I matched with a really cute girl who was way out of my league and we started talking, one thing leads to another and next thing I know we're up to after 2am talking about Pok√©mon of all things. I feel like there's a connection there so i ask her out and she says yes. It took alot to do this and it honestly made my month as the last few have been pretty meh. 

We kept talking the next day and that evening she didn't reply to one my texts, I tried to think nothing of it because it wasn't really a question or anything and tried to restart the conversation but nothing again. 

This morning I said Hi and she replied Hey back and then I asked her what she was up to and she just didn't reply again. I don't blame her if she isn't interested, that's fair enough it happens. She was sending x's up until she stopped texting back though and its not something i thought i was being naive about thinking she was interested in me but maybe i was wrong. 

I kinda just wish i knew where i went wrong. I just feel so unattractive and like there's something wrong with me. I know this probably sounds really petty and unimportant but it really hurts and I just needed to vent.
