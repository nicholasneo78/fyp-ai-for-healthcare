Do you ever zone out and feel like you are a thousand miles away or dreaming when people are talking?
Do you ever feel, (for example), watching people argue, having a conversation or a situation playing out in front of you or a person talking to you and you feel like you are a thousand miles away in a happy place or you are watching the scene play out on TV or in a dream?

This started happening to me once ever 6 months, then once every 3, then every month and now once a week. It lasts 20-25 seconds maximum but afterwards I feel calm and relaxed and as if I am not there anymore. Am I alive? It's hard to explain
