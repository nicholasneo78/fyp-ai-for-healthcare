Today just sucks
 I've been sitting at my desk at work for the past hour and a half crying on and off. Not really sure why. I feel physically sick and I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and sleep for a few days. I'm supposed to teach a class tonight, but I'm really not sure I can function around people. I know I should just cancel it, but I feel guilty doing that, and I have no idea why. It makes no sense since I can't seem to bring myself to care about anything else right now- like the fact that I've gotten almost nothing done at work today and probably won't in the remaining 3 hours. I just don't know what to do anymore.
