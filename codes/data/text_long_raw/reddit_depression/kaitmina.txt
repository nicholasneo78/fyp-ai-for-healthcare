Life is not fun. Is that same for everyone?
Life is not fun. It’s been like this so long that I don’t remember when it was fun. I don’t think it was ever fun. I’m not even sure if I’m in depression although I was diagnosed so. They don’t know anything about me to diagnose right? Is it same for everybody, If that is so, why people let this world to be continued? I don’t know why. I’m really asking why.
