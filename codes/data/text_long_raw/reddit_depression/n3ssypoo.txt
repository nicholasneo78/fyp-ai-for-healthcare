I’m glad none of my close friends know I have reddit
If my friends knew how depressed I was and I how serious I am about committing suicide they would probably put me in some inpatient program. That would just make things worse tbh. The only time I feel okay is it work because I feel needed and I’m helping people. 

Everyday is a constant struggle to stay alive and I hate that there’s still a month and half left until the date I chose. I should probably write my letters soon just Incase I don’t make it. 

I’m glad for this subreddit and that there’s people who understand my pain.
