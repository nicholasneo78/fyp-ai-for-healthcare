I [18f]don’t know what’s wrong with me.
The past year has been good for me. I’ve not been nearly as suicidal as past years and I’ve gotten back in school and met the love of my life but the past few weeks/ days I’ve been sinking really bad. Ive distanced myself from my boyfriend and my very few friends. I’ve just laid in bed and thought about ending everything. I don’t know why the sudden lack of will to live. It’s like I’m 15 again and I’m scared any moment I’ll end my life. I don’t want to want this. I have cats that nobody would take and a little sister that would be devastated. I think my future could be amazing but I’m not sure it’s worth feelings like this much longer. I have nobody to call to distract me bc my boyfriend is busy and I’m so scared.
