Got the news I was 100% cancer free (again) last week, but I feel more emptier and lonelier than ever before.
I'm not sure what's wrong with me, I know I have a great support system and I should be happy that I'm far away from the crutches of painful chemo and surgeries, but I just can't fill the void inside. I feel incredibly lonely and miserable, I barely can rack about 3 hours of sleep a night and at school I feel like an idiot because I can barely focus on anything. 

Anyways, maybe beating cancer isnt really something to be "proud" of. I'm no fucking warrior. I'm terrified about the whole thing. The people I care about think I'm brave but in all honesty I brush it off because I would rather take it again and again just so they wouldn't. I'm.just trying my best to take it day by day, but it's getting harder and harder to deal with everything.
