Going to bed in the morning, waking up at night.
For about a year now, I've been going to sleep in the morning when the rest of my family is getting ready to start their day and getting out of bed in the evening/night.

It started because I transferred to online school and I thought it would be fine to stay up until 3 am or so, but it's gradually gotten worse and worse and as I'm typing this it's 9 am and I'm just now getting ready to sleep. I'm guessing I'll wake up at about 3 pm and actually get out of bed at 4.

It's really screwing with my coursework and making my mental and physical health worse. People keep giving me reasonable advice like turning off distractions and forcing myself to go to bed, or even staying up the whole day so I'm very tired by nighttime, but I just can't find the willpower to go to sleep or get up. I'm not motivated to do anything anymore that I don't have to do. I'm starting to feel like a complete failure.

Has anyone else experienced this or is experiencing it?

(Also I'm taking a lot of melatonin but it still doesn't motivate me to actually get into bed.)
