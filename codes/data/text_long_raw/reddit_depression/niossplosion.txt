How do i stop negative thoughts?
I try to be positive. But honestly the last 2 years has been hard i feel my thoughts are getting worse and worse. I think i am worthless, weak, pathetic and more. And i dont know what to do these thoughts are eating away at me. I can have a good day and then start thinking these thoughts and lose all self confidence. The sad thing is that my friends tell me im worth less also and i try to change as a person to please them. I know i should not hang out with them but then i wont have any friends at all and i will be even more lonely.
