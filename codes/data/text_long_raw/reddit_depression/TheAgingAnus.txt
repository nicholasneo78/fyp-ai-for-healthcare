I did something that made me really happy.
After flunking a test, getting yelled at by a classmate. sitting alone at lunch with incredible anxiety and spilling milk on my uniform and having to go thru an hour long commute in a really hot day i get home feeling really overwhelmed with tons of homework i remember feeling very numb at the time that I just decided to turn off all the lights in my dorm and got completely naked and played my ukelele. i played my favourite song and started crying and just sang at the top of my lungs sounding like a dying whale and it lasted for like 2 hours i could feel every bit of depression and anxiety slowly leak off my body until the water bill knocked on my door.
