extreme sadness whenever seeing anything happy
Hello, this has been bothering me for a while and i have no idea what is this but when i ever i read or see anything happy like a happy scene or a happy story from some random comment i feel a huge wave of sadness wash over me and i feel like crying, why? what is going on?
(i am not sure if this belongs to here but if not i don't mind it being deleted and sorry for breaking rules.)
