Does anyone else feel really bad for people who work dead end minimum wage jobs?
I've worked 3 minimum wage jobs in the past few months. I just can't stand being treated like I'm replaceable and being worked to death for a small sum of money. I finally had enough and am looking at going back to a computer science degree that I dropped out on a year ago. This got me thinking, have any of you ever felt really bad for someone who has worked at a dead end job for 10+ years?
