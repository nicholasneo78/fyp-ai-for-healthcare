I can't stop thinking about suicide and it's making it hard to do anything
I cant get these thoughts of suicide out of my head. The word just keeps popping up in my head. I keep thinking of where I could go, or what effect it would have. I can't get it out of my head. I've been staring at reddit doing absolutely nothing because every time i do something it keeps coming up again and it just distracts me until im slumped in my chair staring or lying on the ground. I used to smoke weed all the time, I like to think it helped me ignore my depression, but it really just made my depression make me more useless than i already am. I don't see the any sort of happy ending to my life. The happiest i can see myself attain is dying alone with a self-published book thats gone unread till I die, then maybe someone will read it. I dont see myself ever finding love, I see friends leaving every minute, every conversation I have with family only makes them hate me more. I try so hard everyday. I feel like im the only one trying. I adapt to my friends, they never pay me mind. I adapt to my family, they dont pay me mind. Its easier staying in my room all day. Where I don't have to exhaust myself in adapting to everyone. Where I don't fuck everything up. 

I just want to do my homework. I don't want these thoughts anymore. I'm not sure i actually will.
