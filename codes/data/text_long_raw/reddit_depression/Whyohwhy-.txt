Lonely and stupid.
I feel so stupid. 

I've always been academic and studious- if anything, I've dedicated my existence to the pursuit of knowledge, at the expense of forming human relationships. But I'm constantly overwhelmed by how much I don't know, how slow I am to understand concepts, and how my peers are all more intelligent than me. I know it's impossible to always be the smartest person in the room, but I feel that the fruits of my studies are disproportionate to my efforts. 

At the same time, I have conflicting feelings over my loneliness. I desire human interaction, but others find me rigid and distant. In all honesty, I'm easily bored by small talk and trivial discussions. I understand that it's important in forming friendships, but my under-stimulated brain seems to automatically 'shut-off' after a while. 

I've noticed that the people I do get along with are like me. Introverted, cold, and academic. We do not see each other as people, but as enlightened books with fresh concepts. These ideas are interesting to explore. If the book is lost, we are disappointed but not crushed. We were never bound by friendship; we were tied by our interests and perhaps mutual isolation. I don't feel an ounce of human warmth from these acquaintances.
