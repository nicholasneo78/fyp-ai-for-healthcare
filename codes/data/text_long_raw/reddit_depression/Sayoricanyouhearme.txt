I'm going to stop eating.
I've been trying to fill the void by eating junk food. Long ago when I was healthy my family knew me for my big appetite. My family doesn't listen to me. Maybe they'll finally notice and finally try for me when I've stopped eating all together. Maybe I'll lose weight too, I don't care if it's just water weight. I drink a ton of water anyway.

I just don't care.
