Tomorrow is my birthday and I really don't give a shit
I really dont like my birthday because the past 5 years have been so horrible for me. Every year on my birthday I just think about how hard everything has been and how unhappy I am, hoping I'll be happier the next year. But then I get to the next birthday and just realize that I'm still so unhappy and unsatisfied with life. I'm just getting tired of it. I hate hearing people wish me a happy birthday when me being happy on my birthday just seems impossible.
