I feel like I dont have control over any of this
So, unfortunately Ive been depressed for as long as I can remember... I have major depression, GAD, PTSD (sexual and verbal abuse) an adjustment disorder, and up until recently, an eating disorder...I used to be on meds... They stopped working... Then I was hit bt a car... Lost two  close people in my life... Moved colleges....Then i was in therapy for a long time... My therapist died... And then i lost my job... No more therapy for me..

Recently started again, but Im just finding that I had hoped id feel so much better so much faster and It just feels like I am so raw... 

I keep going back to thoughts that Im useless... That no one cares... That my life has been ruined because im now perminantly disabled...im constantly in pain and sometimes it's so bad injust want to kill myself to escape it... I have no insurance and no job and most of the doctors ive seen dont care.... I want so despirately for someone to help me... I want to get better and have ANY portion of my life back so I can just fo back to my normal level of manageable anguish I was at before....  Because I cant work anymore I feel like a burden... I moved out of my parents house and in with my boyfriend, and now fully rely on him and my parents to support me financially... I feel like im making everyones lives harder.... I feel like all I do is get in the way... I cant even keep up with housework properly.... I push myself to the point that my back is killing me because I dont want to accept i cant do things anymore.... And then i end up in bed for long periods of time... Wallowing in my own sadness and wondering why the fuck I even bothered in the first place.... I feel like im stuck in this endless loop of "try to get on my feet. Fall.try again. Panic. Try again. Left out. try again. Fall again" i feel like i have no control over any of the things happening in my life.... Its like they are just happening to me and i just have to accept it..
