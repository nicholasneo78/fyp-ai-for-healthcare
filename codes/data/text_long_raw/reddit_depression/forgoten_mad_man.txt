Are my struggles even legitimate? [rant]
I have been wondering that for a long wile, after a friend told me that there life had been worse so I had no right to be the way I am.

And yes I have had a better life then a lot but dose that lessen my experience and hardships ? Yes I have a supportive family and yes I have friends that are willing to listen to my bullshit, but dose that really lessen my inner turmoil and trouble with my mind, so I have to be fucking stabbed by my own brother to make it legit ? 


Yes I know nobody liked school, but did they all make themselves believe it was school or nothing, and when they ended up at a dead and was convinced that there life was over !? Did all kids struggle with basics in school ?! 

Did every kid end up feeling alone no Mather what he or she did there entire life ?! Did they have to feel so alone and unconnected ?! 


I know full well that anyone else wold have done a better job in life then me, I know I’m wasted potential and probably will never live up to the standers my brother set before me, don’t you think I know that ?! Don’t you think at eats at me almost every waking moment of my existence?! 


Am I really that defective that I am just not good enough ?! 

Just because things are moving forward and good for now doesn’t make my feelings and inner turmoil go away ! 


Do you think I wanted/want to be this sad excuse of a human being ?! 


I can’t say anything to anyone, I have learnt that I not only feel alone but I am alone, people just end up getting tired of my shit anyway, so I guess I’ll have to go back to bottling everything inside again, maybe when the glass brakes and I cave i will be free, maybe I will find my freedom in death....idk anymore I just don’t know


....sorry for the long rant and thanks for reading if you did...
