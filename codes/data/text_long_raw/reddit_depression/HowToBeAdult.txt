GF stopped taking antidepressants
So my LDR girlfriend just recently stopped taking antidepressants because her mother pressured her into it. She clearly needs them, she can barely function without them and I told her but she refuses to take them again. Her mother, by the way, is bipolar and very mentally abusive. It seems like my GF had been convinced by her mother that not taking meds is the way to go. I told my parents about this and they agree with her not taking them, claiming it’ll help the “chemicals leave her body.” I don’t know what to do. I want to support her decision but her getting off her meds is clearly affecting her negatively and she’s even sadder and less motivated to do anything now. It’s currently impossible for us to live together and we visit each other 1-2 times a year when school is out. We’re both in uni. 

I myself stopped taking antidepressants cold turkey as well (that was about 5 years ago) and I’m still depressed but not to the point where I can’t go out and do what I’m supposed to like she is experiencing right now. I love her and want to be with her forever but I don’t know how to help at this point, she’s not receptive to my help and hates herself and has no friends where she lives, a small town in Canada.
