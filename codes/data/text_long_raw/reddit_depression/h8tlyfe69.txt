I find myself searching suicide methods.
I can't seem to bring myself to actually end it.  Though I love fantasizing about killing myself, from sitting in my car with the garage closed to overdosing on heroin.  I hate my life I am a failure I haven't accomplished any goal of mine ever, I've lost all of my friends, and I spend all day everyday on my bed.  I want this shit to end but I'm to much of a bitch to kill myself or get off my ass and fix my life.
