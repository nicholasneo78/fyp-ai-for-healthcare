Depression is the enemy you can't beat
I am a fighter like I play brutal sports in college and I'm used to pain, but when it comes to depression I want to defeat it in one simple step but it's not that easy. I go through days where I feel better knowing that there's nothing for me to screw up. I have these feelings not only at night when I'm alone but when I'm with friends and I know that they don't understand it because I get the normal response of "everybody feels that way man." and that's just a worse thing for me to think about. if everyone has it I must be a failure for letting it affect me in such a way where I cant get anything done for school and I just sit on my computer all day. Its miserable.
