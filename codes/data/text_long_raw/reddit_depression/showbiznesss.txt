Taking Tylenol PM, etc. in the middle of the day to sleep
I work in an industry that I can be unemployed for months at a time. I have not had a job since Thanksgiving. I have decided to do something about it and move to a city where there’s more work in my field. In the meantime, however I find myself sitting in a dark room alone bored and ill often take sleeping pills like unisom, or Tylenol pm, and sometimes even Xanax and go to sleep in the middle of the afternoon. Like right now I’m struggling with the thought of taking one right now. I have anxiety and I don’t have much money to spend so I figure if I sleep a lot I won’t spend money. Am I completely messed up? Or does anyone else do this?
