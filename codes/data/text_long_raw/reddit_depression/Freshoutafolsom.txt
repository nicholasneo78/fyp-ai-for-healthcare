carpe diem
Today is the day for change. 

I'm sick and tire of letting my depression get in the way all the time I'm sick of being shy secluded and uninterested I'm sick of letting my depression define me! 

At this very moment nothing but suicidal and depressing thoughts envelop my mind its taking every fiber of my being to not load my gun and just end it. I dont want to solve my problems like that. 

Today is the day!

I've renewed my gym membership I'm going back to work soon im making it a goal to quit smoking and excessively drinking to coap with my depression. Hell I've even make it a goal to stop watching pornography and masterbating for the next 90 days. I'm getting off of my zoloft and I'm going to do my best to turn my life around.

I've let my depression ruin so many friendships and relationships with loved ones I dont want to beat myself up anymore I dont want to use my depression and a means to try and emotionally connect with someone I'm tired of using it as an excuse for everything. I'm tired of loosing people because I refuse or just dont know how to be happy.

I want to actually live again I want to enjoy life not let it pass me by I want to change.
