Massively depressed and looking for low-cost help
Hi there,

I am not the type of person to turn to the internet for self-help, but I'm at a loss about what to do and I feel like I have nowhere to turn. I'm 29 y/o F with a history of depression since age 14. I've been on and off about 3-4 different type of antidepressants and in and out of therapy since initial diagnosis, so neither concept is really foreign to me.

I'm looking for a low-cost way to talk about my symptoms, even an alternative to real "talk therapy". I was in a MSBP-type situation where as a young adult I was forced into therapy when I wasn't ready, and made to discuss what should have been patient protected information with my family after my sessions, so I'm hesitant to "get into" that again after the experience.

Advice? Help? Anything?
