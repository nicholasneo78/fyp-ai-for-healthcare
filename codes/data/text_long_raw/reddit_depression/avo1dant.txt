I am so depressed I don't know what to do
Dropped out of school, have been unemployed for two months, have absolutely no friends and spend my days browsing reddit. Every single day is the same. The monotony never ends. Nothing to look forward to. I try feeling better by shopping and eating tasty food but it never helps. I don't know what to do.
