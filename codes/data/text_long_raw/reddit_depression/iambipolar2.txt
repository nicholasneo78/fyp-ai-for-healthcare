Today is her Birthday. I thought I was moving on.
Today is your birthday. 

You enjoyed the celebrations. You always had a plan. I loved to help make it special .It was your day. 

Today is your birthday and I want nothing more than to tell you I 
love you and hold you tight. To never let you go. 

Today is your birthday and I want to make it special. 

Today is your birthday and for the first time in years I am not there to share it. 

Today is your birthday and I thought I could cope. But your birthday is just a reminder, a reminder that I am sick. Today is a reminder that I let you go because I didn’t know how to hold on. 

Today your birthday and I can’t tell you I love you. My wishes for you drift off into the empty void of your absence. 

Today is your birthday and I yearn to hold you and keep you safe. 

Today is your birthday and your loss cuts to my soul.
