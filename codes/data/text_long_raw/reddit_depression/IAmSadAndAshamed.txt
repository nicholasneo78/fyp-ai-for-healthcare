I am stressed
After doing a bit of research I found out that i matched the symptoms for stress. The symptoms I experience include, but are not (at all) limited to:
Emotional instability (It has not taken much to get me over the edge).
Distancing myself from others.
Low self-esteem.
Frequent headaches.
Low energy.
Insomnia.
Irregular eating patterns.
Frequent colds and infections (within the last 30 days I've gotten 4 separate infections. I've also gotten a cold despite it being 40 Â°C and me being outside all the time).

I don't know what you're supposed to do with this information. I just needed to tell someone. I can't relax at all anymore
