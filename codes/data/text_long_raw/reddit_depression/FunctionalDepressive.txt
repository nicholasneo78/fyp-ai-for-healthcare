Standing in the Rain
Standing in the rain

Letting the clouds cry your pain

Your own tears don't pour

No one checks in anymore

A fraud seeking attention

In reality you're quietly seeking intervention

There's no knocks on your door

No one checks in anymore

Take a long walk down the lane

And stand alone in the rain

You hate yourself for being sick

The mind's candle burning at both ends of the wick

You're losing your grip on what matters,on what's sane

But none of that really matters when you stand in the rain

How long can you play this game

Before you fall into shame and pain

Who knows, so today let's just stand in the rain

Because tomorrow might not be the same

This is probably terrible but I've got too much free time and my mind being idle is very bad.
