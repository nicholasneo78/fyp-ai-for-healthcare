I never asked to be born...seems unfair we can't choose to die
Hi, so they call this "Major Depressive Disorder" and i do take medication for it, but i dont know maybe im just being a realist? Not everyone is meant for this world: i'm awkward, a failure, ugly, and poor. I'm too scared to jump off a cliff or anything violent, i wish i could take those drugs that makes you die peacefully in your sleep...but that's only for cancer patients (terminally ill) or whatever. I'm being forced to live, it's awful.
