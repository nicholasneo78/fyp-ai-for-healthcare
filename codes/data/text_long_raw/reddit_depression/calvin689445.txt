My Life = Depressed Cycle HELL
I have been depressed since my early teens. 18 now. In last year of high school but my grades are horrible, Im MISERABLE at my job but cant quit due to the pay, I completely lack a social life and girlfriend, and have so little motovation I feel like I will flunk out of college if I go. I was going to go to talk to my psychiatrist that does medication management for ADD when I went to see her the other day. I literally couldnt suck up the pride to tell her I was depressed and need a psychologist referal. She even asked how my moods were and I said they were just fine. I feel weird just meeting a random psychologist and dont know how to find a good one. Being a guy I have just sucked it up for the last 5 year and I feel weak for needing help, and even with me telling myself I need help I keep thinking every psychologist listing i see isnt good enough and keep pushing it off like I have for a LONG time.

My life is a MISERABLE cycle of depression that I cant seem to get out of. I NEED help but I literally dont know how I can get myself to suck up the pride and go to a psychologist.
