Unstuck yourself
I used to be stuck in negative mood and had suicide plan at one point. I didn't see the point of doing anything nor meaning of  life itself. One day a light bulb went off. I realize the world is much bigger than any of us could see or imagine from our corner at a given time. We shouldn't refuse to do things just because we don't understand the point. Instead we should celebrate the gift we are given. Just go do things because we CAN! If you are lonely, go talk to a homeless person. You will be surprised how much you could learn. If someone did you wrong at one time, forgive them and live for the future. Life has so much for us to explore. The trick is to start on one thing. Put left foot before right foot, then next ... You will feel better soon once you stop feeling by start doing.
