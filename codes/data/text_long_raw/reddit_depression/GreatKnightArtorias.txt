Just the idea of life makes me depressed.
Why do I even try? I really dont know. I have a job I hate, with a shit boss that blames me for every little thing, only to make money so I can buy the things I like so I keep on ''living''. I know im not gonna get anything better, I suck at everything I like to do so I cant have really get a job about my passion. Never had a relationship and probably never will. Ive never even met anyone who had a ''crush'' on me or anything and I dont look bad. Something pretty bad got blamed on me again at work and my boss is coming back from her vacation tomorow. I really dont want to get scolded and start crying in front of customers. Im the nicest person there and I only made 2 or 3 mistakes since ive been there but for some reason she still seems to hate me. I just have nothing that makes me want to keep living except maybe my love for video games. If I get yelled at again, I dont know what ill do. I just hate living in general, if you can even call it ''living'', more like slaving your life away to me! Anyway I'm just venting here, if you want to share your feelings you are welcome, I'll read them when I can. :)
