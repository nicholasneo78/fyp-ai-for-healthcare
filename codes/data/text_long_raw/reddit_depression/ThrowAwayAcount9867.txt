I’m just not fucking good enough.
My parents fucking hate me, just a few hours ago they were fucking ranting about how I’m not pulling my weight and about how my grades are failing and I’m a failure by extension, my “friends” are slowly jumping ship one by one because “I’m not mentally stable” and nobody actually fucking cares. I’m ugly as hell, my face can be described as if Satan sneered his shit on the earth, I’m probably stupid, and everyone I know would be better off without me. The three people who actually fucking cared about me are fucking dead because of me

One of my two best friends died in a car crash because he was getting me a stupid birthday gift, my other best friend killed her self because I let my guard down and wasn’t there when she needed it, and my aunt drug overdosed two weeks ago, she wouldn’t have been on them if I hadn’t put that unnecessary stress on her

My grades are fucked, I’m fuckin stupid, I’m goddamn hideous, and I fuck up everything I see, I finally see why nobody fucking wants me, I’m just a fucking burden to everyone I know, and every time I attempt suicide I fuck it up cuz I’m a fucking moron... my therapy didn’t work, antidepressants made me feel worse, I guess I’m a hopeless human being. I mean I don’t deserve to be loved or cared about, when there are so many other people who are smarter better and more mentally stable than I am.
