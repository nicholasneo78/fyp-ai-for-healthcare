What ambitions are left to aspire to if you don’t want kids?
I’m a 27 male surrounded by mombies and a culture that I don’t fit into. I feel like I’ve accomplished all my very serious ambitions from graduating college to studying in grad school and withdrawing, twice. (I was doing fine in grad school, they were job prep program. School Psych and a teacher prep program. I withdrew basically because I was apathetic about the job goals/mission. I studied philosophy/psychology during my undergrad and I feel extremely content with all the knowledge I’ve accumulated, but it just feels like I’m getting old. It feels like friends are moving away, the world is getting smaller, less wondrous. It’s like realizing I’m too old to aspire to great things like being an astronaut or something. I feel like my role models are way too big, or that things are just downhill from here. So I’m asking myself questions like why bother working? Why bother moving forward? Maybe I’m pessimistic and think the US political situation is horrible and it’s affecting me. But I wonder how older people without kids keep going forward. What pushes them? I firmly do not want my career to be my only reason to live. I do not want to live to work.
