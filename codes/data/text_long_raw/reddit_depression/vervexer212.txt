Thinking of quiting my job
I work as a waitress and it's killing me inside. I have anxiety along with depression and having to answer phones, greet customers, small talk etc is just exhausting for me. I also don't get along with some people there. My boss and the chef mainly.
I get really anxious the entire day beforehand (work evenings) and it just puts me in a bad spot. 
Another reason for wanting to quit is I'm currently a student and I'm in the last leg of my final year dissertation, I just don't want the stress of having to go deal with my boss and having to take orders etc when I have this important deadline coming up.

The only problem is it's my only income. I don't want my boyfriend getting mad at me because he has to support me with his shitty job for a couple of months untill my project is over and I can find a better job. I feel completely stuck right now and I don't know what the best thing is to do...
