I'm so lonely that I sometimes just want to talk to the dead.
I need advice because I'm quite worried. I have a great family and a best friend and I'm super glad to have these people in my life. But, there's just one thing. I have this very lonely feeling and I sometimes just wish that I had a (good) spirit around me who I could talk to and share my insecurities. I am able to talk to the dead and I have seen many spirits before. I haven't seen one in a long time and I'm just way too scared to summon one or anything. (This is also incredibly dumb) I am not looking for a new (real) friend. Just someone who won't judge me. Is this weird? What do i do? Thanks.
