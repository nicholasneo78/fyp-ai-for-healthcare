I'm tired of it all.
The despair...The hopelessness...the thoughts/contemplation of suicide..

**I FUCKING HATE IT!!**

I don't wanna die,and I don't want to have these damn thoughts of despair either!

What can I do?

What can I do to break the shackles of this bullshit known as depression?!

I mean,Suicide is bullshit ffs and yet I keep coming back to it when I lose hope.

God fucking damnit.

I don't want this. **ANY of this.**

I don't want to die. I don't want to be miserable and I want to believe that everything and everyone will be alright.

But all this damn negativity...Jesus.
