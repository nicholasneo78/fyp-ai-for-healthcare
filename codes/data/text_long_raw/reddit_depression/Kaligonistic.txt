What's happening?
I just felt the weirdest mix of emotions. I was normal, but then I started tearing up and breathing really hard. I began to cry but I was smiling. My body went numb and I held my hands up to my face. I continued to cry and laugh at the same time. I pulled at my hair. It's over now. I still feel numb.
