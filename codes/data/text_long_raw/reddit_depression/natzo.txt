I just want to get this off my chest
My depression comes and goes, same for my anxiety. The doctor said its that I have an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Somedays I feel fine, others I feel crushing loneliness. I'm 28. Never had a girlfriend and have become distant from my friends. I have no idea of how to meet new people. I just... I dunno, sometimes it feels like I should have my life on track by now. My sisters were married at this point, meanwhile, I never had an intimate relationship nor even a small idea of how to start one. I see people with successful careers, homes, families at my age, yet I feel like I'm just going day to day growing older with nothing to look forward to. I don't want to kill myself but sometimes I wish I just ceased to be. My hobbies don't feel fulfilling any longer and sometimes I just want to sleep the morning away mainly to make the day shorter. I can't even force myself to enjoy parties because I feel this pressure on the back of my neck and after a while and it becomes unbearable. I need to leave to feel better and yet I feel worse in loneliness.

I don't know.
