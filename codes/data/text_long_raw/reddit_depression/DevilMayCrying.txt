bored of consumerism
Already bought everything I've ever wanted and more. I have designer clothes. I have a rolex. I have $200 shoes. I have a porsche 911. I've bought $1000 escorts. I don't even get a rush from these things anymore. It's boring. I just want to be good looking and have a gf who loves my looks. THat is all. Sick of being single but girls don't like depressed guys with anxiety. It sucks.
