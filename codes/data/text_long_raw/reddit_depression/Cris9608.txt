It's all just a never ending struggle
Life's a war. A war to find a job and to find a SO.  And a war with yourself if you can't find one those things. Life is crap.

I think my parents didn't want to have a child, but they made me anyway, so it won't be their fault that they didn't "continue". They made me a shy, helpless, depressed, anxious moron who's not able to achieve anything.

Fuck life, it's full of crap. If there would be a suicide pill I would take it right away, but I would make them suffer.
And who the fuck would care if I die beside my parents? 
Man fuck this.
