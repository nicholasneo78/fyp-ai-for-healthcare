I Dont Know
I would die if you guys could all go back to your original former or happy selves and stay there. I think I've been making a breakthrough lately. But i still think ive taken more L's in life than a lot of people I see or pass by. Why me? Why this? Guys why do i have go through so much pain in life? Why did I have to witness little boys get bullied, my mom getting beaten to a pulp by some drunk, why do I have to see all of this? I have to fight for my own, thats what Im just now putting into practice. I hate life, people always selling me short, girls never paying attention even though you share every aspect of humanity that you've discovered with them. Coutesy, manners, all dont mean a thing. Im sitting on the pavement, homeless, tired, grumpy, sane, hungry, warm. I hope that I stomp a few people into the ground before I die, because I hate how much shit I've eaten.
