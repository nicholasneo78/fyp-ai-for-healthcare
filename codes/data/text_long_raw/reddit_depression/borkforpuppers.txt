Intrusive Thoughts
 I feel like I am standing on a grassy hill and the blades of grass is blowing in the wind around me, the sky is turning darker and darker. I can feel it becoming colder and the rain starts. When it rains it pours. The intrusive thoughts, the little will I have left to keep myself upright, the wind makes one big push and I fall. I fall hard. The wind is keeping me pushed down as I lay flat on my back and watch the storm go by, its cold, dark and rainy. People close to me are pushed out and a large glass cup is placed over me. They can’t see I am struggling and if they do they can’t get in. How long is the storm going to stay this time? I am not sure. The sad thoughts are like my safety blanket. Whenever things feel okay the thoughts come over and hug me tight. I am constantly depressed. When I laugh or smile, it’s like putting  a band aid over a small cut. It feels better and it can start healing, but when I feel sad its like the  band aids rip off and I am faced with the hurt all over again. The mask I put on, the adhesive falls right off when it no longer needs to be on. I am falling apart yet I am hanging on by a thread.
