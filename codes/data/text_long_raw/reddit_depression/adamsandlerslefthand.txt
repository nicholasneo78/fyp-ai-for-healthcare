I'm Ugly and it's killing me
I'm quite young, still a teen. But I'm ugly as fuck. Even my best friends call me ugly. Even some people that I barely know have called me ugly in the past. And I'm not fat/out of shape. It's all in my genes. I'm aware that looks aren't everything but lets be real here; they matter a lot more than we'd like to admit. Not only when it comes to dating but also friendships as well as many other things. We prefer attractive people over unattractive ones no matter the context. My parents aren't ugly, my sister isn't ugly, I have no idea why I'm as ugly as I am. It kills me to think about what others think about my looks. I absolutely hate it.
