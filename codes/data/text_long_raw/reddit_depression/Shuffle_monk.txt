Just a rant
So today my parents came from NY to pick up the kids from me as I will be leaving the country for 6ish months soon.  My soon to be ex wife leaves to move back to Japan tomorrow.

This girl I started to hang out with and we both seem into each other but she has reservations about anything serious bc we work together just informed me that she is pretty much busy until I leave the country....which does coincide with one of her best friends moving as well...awful timing I know.

I just feel so alone...my kids are gone...my marriage is done (im actually happy about this after months of depression)...and the person who i had started to grow closer too said we cant really hangout (probably) before I leave :/.

Sorry i know others have more bigger problems but these are mine.
