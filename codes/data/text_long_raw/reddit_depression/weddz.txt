Insurance for therapy?
I have decided to look into getting a therapist to deal with issues of depression and anxiety. I'm still on my parents insurance plan which should cover most of the cost. However, I've heard it can be a bad idea to use insurance to pay for therapy as insurance companies can audit your sessions to see if you still require them to keep paying for it. I am concerned about privacy and having trouble getting insured in the future with mental health issues on my record, but paying out of pocket is not a great option either as I'm currently a broke college student. Anyone have a similar situation?
