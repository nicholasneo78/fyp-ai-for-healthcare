I feel as though eventually I am going to kill myself
I’ve told a couple friends this. They’ve told me that I need to see my therapist more, and that I need to get back on my meds. But what if I’m content with this thought? I don’t remember the last time I was truly happy. At best I’m content. Most of the time though I’m in a shitty mood.

I don’t really give a fuck anymore that people might be upset that I’d commit suicide. I definitely don’t give a fuck when people get worried when I say that I’m gonna do it eventually. It is what is. I’m not happy, I never will be. When I tell my therapist that I’ll never be happy he asks me if I can predict the future. Obviously I fucking can’t but if the last 15 years have been any indication of what my happiness is gonna be then it ain’t gonna get any better

With all of that said, and here I go contradicting myself, but all of what I’ve just previously wrote scares the absolute shit out of me. I’m terrified that I’m starting to give less of a fuck. Also, while I don’t think I’ll ever truly be happy, I still have hope that I will be one day. But it’s not looking good
