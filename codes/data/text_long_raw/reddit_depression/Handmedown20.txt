Do you ever?
Do you ever sit there and go "what the fuck is wrong with me" because obviously something must be wrong with me for people to not want to talk to me. I know I'm not the most emotionally upbeat person but it's hard to hide how you feel all the time and sometimes I just want to be able to tell someone.
