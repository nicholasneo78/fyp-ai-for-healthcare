Work
I have a problem with always assuming everyone thinks Im terrible worker(well outside of work i just assume people think bad of me and i try so hard to prove im worthy). Im not a bad worker. Im an awesome worker. I do good work and never spend time on my phone or anything like that. But when im working on a job I feel as if my boss is watching me thinking to himself. "Fucking that guy needs to get a move on" or something like that. Im constantly asking my boss " So we have a good week? Anything you want to tell me" he says no but I still feel he talks shit in his mind or behind my back. Its alot of wasted stress I wish I could stop putting myself through. Thanks for reading. And i know its a me problem just need to vent. Thank you.
