Should I go to the hospital? [please respond]
Minor living with adult sibling right now. Idk whether I should go to the hospital. I’ve had suicidal urges surface recently and I’m afraid that I’ll succumb to the temptations and kill myself. 


But the hospital just seems so miserable, and my psychologist told me if I wanted to go I’d stay until my parents arrived (2 weeks). Also do you get to use your phone and computer in the hospital?



Idk what to do. I’m trying to find reasons to live but am falling short. Help.
