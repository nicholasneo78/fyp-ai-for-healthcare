I can't stop dreaming about having friends.
I don't know why I use this daydreaming technique every single day. I can't trust real people because they always seem selfish to me. I have that weird, twisted image of having a best friend who doesn't judge me and enjoys spending time with me, but it's not real. 

People are not perfect and I push them away or worse, I don't and they use me or tease me forever because apparently I'm too kind and I act like a stray animal. What should I do? I'm so lost. How can I escape my dreams? I'm 26 and I don't have any close friends and I end up talking to my cats or my plushy because interacting with humans makes me incredibly tense. I'm on meds. I was beaten, I sometimes talk too loudly or too quietly because I was a shut-in for a year and I can't control my voice sometimes, maybe that's the problem? 

How to quit chatting with my imaginary friends so I'm less lonely and depressed?
