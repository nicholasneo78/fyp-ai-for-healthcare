Can't relate or make friends with anyone my age
19 years old, just got out of highschool. Anyways, I'm a chill dude, good looking, and sociable. Anyways, I have trouble making any fucking friends with dudes my age (no trouble with girls). I'll vibe with them really well at first and play sports or whatever with a few of them. They seem pretty friendly but at the same time some of their other friends seem to kind of hate me even though they act polite when interacting with me. I can even hear them talk shit sometimes from a distance even tho there's no personal beef and most of them haven't spoken more than a sentence to me b4? however they won't directly confront me and at least be upfront. Literally even in highschool I'd have dudes try to test me and start shit with me though I didnt even know them lol fuck this shit, is every kid my age a fuck boy? I met a few chill ppl, but damn most of them seem like insecure cunts...it's just making me hate ppl more and myself more.
