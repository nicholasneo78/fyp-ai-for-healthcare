When people say dont quit SSRIs, listen to them
I was put on 20mg Lexapro through my university's health center, but summer rolled around and since I wasnt taking a physical class (online ones dont qualify you for student insurance apparently) I had to pay ~$400 for coverage in the summer in addition to actually paying for my prescriptions. I thought I was in a good enough place (not financially though, obviously) that I didnt even need Lexapro anymore so I started using my remaining bottle and taking smaller doses every day. I went from about 20mg to 5mg a day for a week or two and then I ran out. Fast forward to today (several weeks without) and I feel like i'm having a mental breakdown over every single thing, i'm a 22 year old man and have broken down crying multiple times in the past 2 weeks and have been getting increasingly angry and even violent in some cases. I was kept waiting too long in a lobby at my apartment for mail and I ended up telling the employees to go fuck themselves and ended up throwing a chair. This is all very interesting considering I got on this and xanax because i couldnt even order food wothout having a nervous breakdown. Another instance is when I stubbed my toe and proceeded to trash my entire fucking apartment and even took a machete to my fridge

Dont fucking quit cold turkey. I thought I could handle it but I definitely cant. I just hope this ends soon. I honestly feel like i'm losing it entirely
