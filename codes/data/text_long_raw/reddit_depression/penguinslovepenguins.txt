Some days I function fine and everything seems "normal", other days everything feels foreign.
Sometimes I can do whatever and it just feels like any other day. On other days, I'm freaking the fuck out. It feels like I don't know how to do anything because everything seems so unfamiliar. From walking down the road to the grocery store to brushing my teeth. It's funny now when I think about it because it's all so easy :D
