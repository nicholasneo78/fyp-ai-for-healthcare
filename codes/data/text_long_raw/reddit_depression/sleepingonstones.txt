Why depression is, and isn't like a skinned knee: Some thoughts I had that I wanted to share
I was just pondering depression, and I decided to jot down what I was thinking. It's sort of a good way to put words to what it feels like to suffer from depression.

Why it IS like a skinned knee:


Depression usually comes in episodes for me, and a lot of people I've talked to. Sometimes I'll be doing okay, and then have a really bad day, or even a bad week. 

These episodes are sort of like skinning your knee. When you were little, skinning your knee feels like the absolute worst thing in the world. You think, "OW, THIS HURTS SO MUCH! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?!" 

You feel so helpless. 

When you're an adult and skin your knee, you know what to do. You know that you're supposed to clean it, and put a bandage on it. And that's exactly what you do; you don't make a fuss. 

But, even though you clean it and bandage it, it's of course still going to hurt. It's a cut. You just ignore the pain, though, because you've already taken care of it, and there's not much else you can do beyond that. You just have to live with the fact that it's going to hurt for a while.


Depression is the exact same way. When it happens, you know what you should do to handle it. The best way, backed by science and research, is what we've all heard countless times: Exercise, eat healthy, do something nice for yourself, clean your living space, listen to happy music, watch TV shows that make you happy, etc.


So you know to do this stuff. But of course, it's not going to magically feel 100% better right off the bat. There's still that emotional pain there, just like the way a skinned knee stings. But you've already done everything you can to take care of it, so you have to live with it and wait patiently for the pain to go away.

Why depression ISN'T like a skinned knee:


Most people know that depression has a way of demotivating sufferers. Things you once enjoyed no longer interest you. Nothing seems like it has a point.


But this also affects your drive to treat your depression. When you skin your knee, you just take care of it right away, you don't give any second thought to it. It's just what you do. With depression, you know that you should be exercising, eating healthy, listening to happy music, cleaning, etc. But you don't. What's the point? 


The difference is, that depression makes you NOT want to get better, or more accurately, not care about getting better. Sometimes, you're just apathetic and nihilistic, "What's the point? I don't care. Getting better is too much effort."
Sometimes, you just want to wallow in your own despair. For me, when I feel this way, it's because I feel worthless and self-loathing. I think, "I deserve to feel this way. I deserve this emotional pain that I'm going through. I don't deserve to feel better, or to be happy."


That's the vicious cycle that depression uses to keep you down.


If you are reading this and have depression, I hope this helps you understand your own illness a little more clearly. If you're reading this and you don't have depression, I hope this gives you a good account of what it's like, so you can empathize with people who have depression.


Stay safe, everyone.
