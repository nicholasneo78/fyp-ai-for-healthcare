My new kitten disapeared this night and i can't help feeling like trash.
Last year I adopted a kitty to help me through my depression, we lived a year together. She ran away after I had to move back to my father's house back this april.

Last week i finally decided to adopt a new cat after so much time and she just disapeared while I was out of the house. My father says he just turned his head for a while and she was gone. I've been searching for her all day. Feeling hopeless, lonely and useless. I shouldn't have left the house yesterday.

I miss the little girl so much. She was the best companion i could have had.
