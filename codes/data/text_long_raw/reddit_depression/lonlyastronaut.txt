My struggle
I barely get out of bed, I lost my job because I got to depressed to go in, My family don’t speak to me because they don’t believe in how depressed I am, I’ve distanced myself from all my friends they don’t even check up on me anymore. 

I just feel like I’ve been forgotten and it hurts so, so much
