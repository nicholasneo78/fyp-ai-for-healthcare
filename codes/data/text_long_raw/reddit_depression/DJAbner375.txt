My brother has depression and I need help
I’ll start off by saying I’m not sure if this is the right place to say this and if it isn’t, I’d love if you could point me in the right direction. My brother has a multitude of things such as depression, anxiety and anger issues. Recently he has been going to IOP (can’t exactly remember the name, but it’s a step below inpatient care) at a facility and he has shown some progress. I feel like he’s more in touch with how he feels and is working on coping mechanisms better. However he did not go to his session today and that caused problems. He got his check from work today and it would not get deposited, and that set him off into a fit. He started breaking things and getting in both mine and my parents faces, cussing and attacking us. We had a conversation after and he said he tells himself the thing we tell him, such as how he needs to be more rational and more committed to getting better. He also eats unhealthy and is overweight, and I’ve attempted to help him get healthier about a month ago, but he stopped listening to me about. I love and care for him deeply but our family is at our wits end with what to do. I would want to leave him be and let him sort his issues out without us harassing him about it but when he gets violent and angry around the house we can’t sit idly. I’m not sure what the next step is but I’d love to hear advice from anyone. Thanks for listening.
