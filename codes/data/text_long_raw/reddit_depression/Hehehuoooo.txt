Do you ever feel like why bother we’re all going to die anyhow and all we’ve accomplished and done will be forgotten?
I enjoy art, but I often think why bother. I’ll die one day and all my art work will be thrown away. There’s a lot I do enjoy but none of it serves any purpose. After you go on vacation for example you’re just left with the memories, until you get old and forget it all. Sure it was fun at the moment but serves no long term purpose and one day even the memories will be gone. They say enjoy life but why? Animals don’t. They just do what they do. They’re only purpose is to keep their species alive and technically that’s our only purpose in life to keep our species going. Maybe if we didn’t spend so much time focusing on life and enjoying it we’d actually be happier people and more accepting of pending doom. I don’t know, that’s just how I feel most of the time. Why I even bother to write this or anything else on Reddit I don’t know.
