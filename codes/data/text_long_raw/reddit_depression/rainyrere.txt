Does anybody feel like their life is meaningless if they don’t have a relationship or crush
In my opinion it feels like love is the only medicine strong enough to cure my depression. Whenever I’m in love or lust I’m on top of the world I feel so good everything feels great, but once something happens to it I fall down this hole and my depression comes back even stronger. I need to learn to be their for me to grow love for myself. That almost seems impossible but I won’t give up and I’m going to work on becoming a better me. Better for myself, better for my life, and kicking my depression away once and for all.
