Currently waiting at the hospital to be seen
If I don't get treatment I am going to kill myself.  No one in my daily life cares. My sister and my mom didn't give a shit. My abusive boyfriend dumped me today and told me never to contact him again. 
I feel broken. 
I don't want to live in society anymore. I want to live in a hospital ward and not have to think. I don't want to live at all
