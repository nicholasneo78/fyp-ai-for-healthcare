Could use some random, late night friends
I've started a prescription and it's at least two weeks for it to build but in the past week I've had nothing. Waiting a week until I can request an increase in dose.

Looking for people who are generally online from 10pm-1am central time. Hopefully I can move back to /r/anxiety but the last three weeks have been more brutal than in a long time and I'd love to be able to talk to people who won't make me feel insane for some of these thoights.
