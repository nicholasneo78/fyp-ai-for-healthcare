Sometimes i just think that Dylan Kleboldband Eric Harris were right you know?
Fuck this world. I have very few/no friends at school (none of then want to invite me to hangout after school), I’m an ugly piece of shit, short and weak, i have no social life, I don’t get invited to any parties, I’m invisible in the eyes of girls, everyone seems to enjoy high school and are experiencing a normal happy teenage life, and then there’s me. No one cares about me I’m fucking pathetic. I hate my mom she is a piece of shit and i just want her out of my life and sometimes even dead. I’m incel. This world is a shitty place. I’m so scared of what will happen if i somehow manage to literally survive high school.  Will i just work a boring job the rest of my life? Wake up, work, come home, sleep, repeat? What the fuck. No one will even know of me let alone care about me. What if I can’t find something to do when I grow up? Now is my chance to have fun and be a little bad without severe consequences and I’m wasting it away being a depressed shit. I’m missing out. What if nothing changes when I’m too old to make that change? When I’m passed the point of no return? This is no way to live. School is shit. I’m shit. My life is shit. Everything is shit. Fuck.

Edit- i spelled klebold wrong
