I'm Weakest At Night...
I don't understand the reason for this, but for as long as I can remember I've always been weakest during the night time. I feel weak mentally, emotionally, physically, internally... I feel like I can't go on, like I can't keep fighting, like I've had enough... I freeze over, my body locks up, my fear paralyzes me, and my mind becomes my enemy... 



Night seems endless because I can't see much of anything no matter where I try to look. From minor fears to worst nightmares stalk me like I'm nothing but an insignificant prey who's time has come. I'm exhausted and need sleep, but only nightmares haunt me or the fear of being attacked while I'm immobile by unconsciousness...



And yet, though a part of me yearns for light, for the warm comfort of the sun, it only depresses me. In the light I can see what I truly am, I can see a reflection of something I've grown to hate. When I look at my reflection I want to smash the mirror so I can no longer see the truth of my insignificant existence. In the light I can see everyone else, either continuing on with their lives without a thought of me or a second glance. Or I see other people like me suffering and it both hurts and gives me a strange, and possibly, a cruel comfort. I hate seeing other's suffer, but I'm so insignificant I am helpless that I might as well be dead... 



I need the light and yet it hurts me...
