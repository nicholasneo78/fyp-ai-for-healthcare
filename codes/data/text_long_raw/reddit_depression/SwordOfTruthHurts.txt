Love is what makes the ride worthwhile
Without love, why suffer through anything at all? For what gain? 

I've had love, and I lost love. Love is so powerful a feeling, its a state of being. A person always has within him to very different personalities. That's you without love and you while in love. 

In love, I'm full of goals, ideas, glass half full, my bank account may be low, but it doesn't effect me. I can deal with anything while in love. I'm more confident while in love. I loved to buy her little gifts, make desserts for her, clean the room so she can relax after a long day, shower with her and wash her body, and of course fuck.

Out of love... I'm still in love with her, but we can no longer be together. I'm scared of the world now. Constantly battling anxious thoughts and worries. I spend my days now trying to stay above water, to not drown in the depression. But no matter how well I swim that day, the pull is still my depressive state. Everyday it's like I'm staring into a black abyss that probably goes down infinitely. It's hypnotic and my main goal for the day is to pretend that this gaping exist actually doesn't exist within me. 

So that's just what's been on my mind lately. My new normal.
