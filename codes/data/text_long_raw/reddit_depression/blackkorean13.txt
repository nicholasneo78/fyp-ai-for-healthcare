lonely
Despite having great family that thinks the world of me, I just feel so damn alone all the time. I have great friends that reassure me that I'm not alone, but I struggle forcing myself to believe that. I hate this about myself because I'm grateful to have what I have, and I am god awful at showing my appreciation for this. A lot of the time I'm mentally just not here at all. Most days I can't stop feeling so shitty to the point where some days I'll take 5 hour naps throughout the day just to avoid any shallow conversation with other people. I've tried going into things with a positive mindset, but I still just felt distant.

Any advice?
