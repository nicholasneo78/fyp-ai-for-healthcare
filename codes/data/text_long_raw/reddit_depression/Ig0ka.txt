Can anyone cheer me up?
Apparently, my dad used to work in another country. While he was away, my mom allegedly cheated on him several times. The only source of mine is my cousin, who gets the info from my sister. So I guess it is true. And to think about it, she did wear a lot of makeup back then. Not the normal amount I mean. To keep it short, when this hit me, I could not imagine her cheating on my dad. I’ve also heard that they are not divorcing because of me, which is plain stupid. All in all, I am pretty much down, I’ve never thought that she would be capable of doing such a thing.
