Law of Attraction is bullshit. Also hard work doesn't pay off.
Everything in life is based on chance and luck only. 

Our society preaches the fiction of hard work paying off because we need most expandable people to work hard, so that the rest can just chill and live off their backs.

Also every fucking motivational coach and self-help guide is a fucking scam. Focusing your goals, working hard and putting effort in to achieve them? Yeah, tell that to people with terminal diseases or people living in poverty without the chance to ever get better, people dying of famine or living in war zones. 

Tell that to the legions of people who didn't make the cut and never will. Yeah, tell them they just "didn't work hard enough", "didn't want it enough" while you completely ignore how fucking lucky you got to be in the privileged position you are in. 

This world makes me fucking sick and I get sicker every day.
