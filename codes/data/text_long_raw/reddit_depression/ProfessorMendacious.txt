I can't handle this anymore
I have no perspective in life. I am 19 but I feel like a 50 year old alcoholic. When I drink, I can't stop. Just for your information: I am "only" a social drinker. But the thing is, I am done. I don't know how I could get old. I can't handle life now even though I get everything spoonfed by my parents. I don't know how I could handle it later. I'm at that point where I don't even care if a car hits me. The thought of death is just so relieving. Btw I'm incredibly drunk (again) right now and I just wanted to share this.
