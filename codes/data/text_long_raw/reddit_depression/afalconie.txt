My family underestimate my depression and say it's just me following other depressed teens.
It frustrates me that no one takes my feelings seriously. I don't want to talk to anyone, I isolate myself but deep down I just want to be normal again. I failed my SAT's and that was my only way out of my situation. I feel guilty that my mood and my sadness affects my family but I can't help it. And not being able to control it just makes it worse. I can't make connections with anyone. Everyone my age is traveling or in relationships and here I am, sad and crying myself to sleep at night. I feel hopeless and stupid. I'm 18. I should be out there living my best life but I'm just wasting away in my bed.
