Why?
Why do I feel this way? Why am I always tired all the time? Why can't I get out of bed in the morning, take a shower, and be productive? I want to do so much but I just don't seem to care, or have the motivation anymore. A year has passed and everything is the same, I'm living the same day over and over again and I don't know how much longer it will last. Why am I always in my own head? I'm always thinking about the past, just wishing I've done things differently or even did things at all. If only I made other decisions in life maybe I wouldn't be where I am now, tired and alone. Why am I like this? Why was I put into this life of emptiness and failure? I just want it to stop, but at the same time this is all I know, and I just have to except it I guess.
