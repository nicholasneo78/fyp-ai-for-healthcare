My boring sob story
Family members told me all the time that being an adult is shit and I should make the most of being a kid. So when depression hit me I thought it was normal, but it didn’t feel “right.” I wasn’t upset all the time, it was just like a flat misery sort of feeling.

Things started to feel odd for me, certain sounds and smells and silly things like the wind of my face felt wrong. Like they’d be toned down somehow. Eventually I became completely disconnected from my emotions, save for the occasional moment when I actually find something funny. I’ve been on two types of medication and had therapy too, neither of which did anything for me. 

I didn’t notice myself become so gradually withdrawn from everything. Now going to the shop or getting the bus is something I’d rather not do. Things I’d do every day. My social life went backwards as well as my social skills. Now I’m afraid to talk to people. I literally reject girls I’m interested in on the spot, before I even have chance to fuck it up myself. Things that I would do without thinking now take encouragement and energy. 

Then came the cynicism. Belief that nobody out there was pure and everything they did was for their own personal gain. Suppose it’s true in a sense but I wish I didn’t have this “paint everybody with the same brush” mindset.
It’s hard to believe I’m the same person at times. It’s been 7 years now and I’ve had enough. Just dunno what to do. I feel like I’ve tried everything. Can’t help but feel I’m partly responsible, for buying into the shit I told myself.
