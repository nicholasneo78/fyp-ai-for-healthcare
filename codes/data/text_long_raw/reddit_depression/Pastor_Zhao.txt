In the mood to vent
So I'm gonna make this self deprivating post quick. I was a sick child. Shit was fucked. Too young to understand what was going on and had lots of surgeries and what not. I possibly have autism, I was diagnosed with sensory processing disorder to get O.T. however I think they gave me that so I wasn't stuck with the label of autism. I think they believed I was too young to be diagnosed and so I never got a checkup from a psychiatrist after O.T. . So it's possible I'm autistic but idk. Anyway my childhood was shit. Absolute fucking garbage. I was the loser kid. Had physical issues so I never left the house. I was ugly and fat. My entire childhood was just a big fucking waste of time. Anyway I become 16 and start hanging around bad kids. At this point I lost all fucks to give about my schooling. My social skills were finally developed enough so I can make friends but I didn't really like any of them. I started getting a prescription for drugs. It wasn't very difficult given my medical history. Started taking Adderall daily. And my mom would occasionally give me some Xanax she had. Also started drinking. I guess some warning signs for a shitty life but idk. I'm not entirely sure what to do at this point. I plan on going to community college since I'm probably gonna drop out of HS soon. I just don't think I'm ready for the real world. I always feel like I'm that one person who just can't adapt to things.
