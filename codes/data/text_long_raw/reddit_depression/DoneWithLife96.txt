Its enough to finish this, i cant move out and im everyday keeping my anger in myself to dont hurt anyone

I need 3-4 months of working to even earn enough money for one month of living, i dont have enough willpower for it.

When you listen everyday how useless, bad you're its really pushing me on the edge everyday, 600$ is a threshhold between life and death, i will be able to deal with my 600$ debt i guess in this month, but i dont have enough to rent a room and buy food

And i dont have enough willpower to handle her anymore, i was called "shit", "useless", "egoist"  yesterday, i just can only stare on her and be treated like she wants because i cant do anything.Total helplessness and i only have girlfriend who is helpful but she doesnt have her own place and she is in another country now


Im done, its over
