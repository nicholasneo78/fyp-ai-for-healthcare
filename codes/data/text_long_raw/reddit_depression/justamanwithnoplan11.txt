I feel like I’m spiraling downwards. I’m losing people and can’t do anything about it or do the wrong things. I’m just searching desperately for someone to care before it’s too late.
This summer has just flown by. I work so much and made the mistake of taking multiple summer classes. I spend every moment I can trying to do fun things with my friends but many times it’s not as much as I’d like.

My best friend is stationed overseas, and while I have a close group of friends I’ve known for years, literally all of them are doing something this fall that takes them elsewhere. When they are gone, I’m going to be all by myself. 

I’ve been so lonely lately too. Just wanting someone to care about me. I had it and fucked it all up at the beginning of the year, and I just regret it all the time. I drink by myself a lot at night to deal with the loneliness, but it makes it worse.

This summer has already just been shitty, but at least my friends are around. It’s like fall is just a ticking time bomb at this point. No matter how hard I try to talk to someone new it never goes my way and I’m always left on read or stood up on plans.

The other night, I got drunk and did something I’ve never done before, and that was cut myself. Honestly, I feel like I did it to see if I could, and how it would make me feel. I guess I still don’t know how it does, but I was disappointed in myself I let it get so far.

I don’t know. I just feel like this year has just been me slowly losing the only things that make me happy.
