Everyday I wake up and get into character
Do any of y’all ever feel like you get up and get into character? Like the real you isn’t conscious? I get up go to work, talk to people and say what is expected to be heard but I never say what I’m truly thinking. They ask me “how are you?” I answer back “good” quickly but don’t really think about it. I smile when I lock eyes with someone, I greet everyone enthusiastically, on the outside looking in people think I’m the happiest person but really I’m not at all. 

Idek if this makes sense but basically I’m just wondering if any of y’all go through or have gone through this as well?
