Pretending I don't exist is the only way I can feel better...
 I like to pretend that nothing I do affects anybody. I wish that I could just do whatever and not worry about how the world around me is impacted by it, but I know that isn't true. Everybody acts like I don't exist anyway so might as well embrace it. 

 -&gt; Go to school

 -&gt; Be a zombie at school while pretending my feelings don't exist

 -&gt; Don't cry don't cry don't cry...

 -&gt; Fail math

 -&gt; Go home

 -&gt; Pretend everything is just peachy

 -&gt; Apply headphones

 -&gt; Turn volume up to ear killing levels

 -&gt; Try not to worry about the neighbour kids and how they are probably getting abused

 -&gt; Lay down, and now...

 -&gt; I do not exist.
