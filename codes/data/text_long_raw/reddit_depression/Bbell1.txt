Post-Graduation Depression
I recently graduated from college, and over the past couple of months I’ve grown increasingly depressed. I feel this profound sense of loss and it feels as if the color has drained from the world. What’s shocking to me is that I honestly hated college - I was either working or studying 24x7. I rarely had a single moment for myself or friends and was constantly exhausted and anxious. Now, I have a great job, live with my girlfriend, have almost no debt (thanks to working so much in college), and live in my ideal area. My life is comparatively so much better, but I feel this knot in my stomach as if I just finished a good book or beat the story of a video game and now I’m finally seeing how much of myself I’ve given up to get to where I am. Life feels devoid of adventure and I feel like I have no passion left. I’ve struggled with depression for a long time, but it’s weird to have it catch up with me at the point in my life where past sacrifices were meant to mitigate it.
