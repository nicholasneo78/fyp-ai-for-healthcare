Hitting a rough patch-any words of encouragement or friendship would be helpful.
Hey all, I’m having a really rough time-I’m confused, sad, and afraid. I’ve had anxiety and depression for years, but had some very good months until recently things have gotten very bad. My thoughts are dark and I feel trapped. I have close friends and family but I just can’t get the words out to describe how I’m feeling. I feel numb, dissociated from reality, easily fatigued, and just very sad. I don’t believe I will get better or my future is bright. I am convinced I’m destined to be unhappy and that I will not find love. I want to scream out with how awful I feel. I just want someone to understand, someone to tell me it’s going to be ok :(
