Getting over a girl
Hello everyone, I’ve been subscribed to this sub for a while now but always been a lurker and never posted anything. I feel that this is the best place to get advice and help for what I’m going through right now...

So I’m a 19 year old guy, I’ve never had a serious relationship with a girl before. 

I met this girl a few weeks ago and I instantly liked her. She’s the most amazing girl I’ve ever met. She’s funny, smart and so beautiful. We started texting/snapchatting. I told her I liked her and she said she felt the same about me. We started “talking” and we met a few times and things were going really well. Last weekend she stopped over at my house and we watched some Netflix and had such a good night with each other. I knew I was in love with this girl and I could honestly see us getting in a relationship in the future. After she left my house the following morning she started acting weird. I asked her what was wrong and she said her ex boyfriend was going crazy because she stayed over at my house. She then said she just needed to be alone for a while and that we should stop seeing each other because she still hasn’t properly got over her ex. It was so horrible, I started crying for ages and I couldn’t stop. I still feel so upset about it and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get over her. How can I get over her? I can’t stop reading our texts messaging of us saying we love each other. This is so hard. I’m crying again.
