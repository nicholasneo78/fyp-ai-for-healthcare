I want give up
I'm 17 years old, I live in Brazil.
So how could I explain my history?
Well, I was born in 2000 and I never knew my real father.
my mother worked a lot and I spent my day at school and in my grandma's house with my cousins what was very nice, I had a happy childhood.
when I was 4 my mom meet a guy who was very nice and I had a huge connection with him, calling him of dad and that's stuff, so they married and I have had a little sister which I loved at the first time I saw her, everything was good.
Then when I was 13 my parents got divorce, and me and my sister decided to stay with dad.
I met some awesome friends, the best people I ever met, but we are sorting out..
Now dad is getting married again, my mom is pregnant and is a risc pregnancy, she can lose the baby and her life... And I have to study for exames If want to do a college (is very hard in Brazil) but I don't know what I want to do, and I don't want live in Brazil anymore, but I need money to travel, even if I won a scholarship... And I've got depression for 2 years now... Is hard to keep alive for me...
