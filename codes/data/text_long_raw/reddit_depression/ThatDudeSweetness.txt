Things not funny anymore?
Not sure if anyone else can relate to this but it seems as of late I don't laugh anymore. When I watch my favorite channels on YouTube I just sit there silently, not laughing like I used to. It's weird because these videos used to be my release but now it's a chore to just get through them.
