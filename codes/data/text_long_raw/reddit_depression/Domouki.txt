I always try to be friendly with people
I tired of pretending I'm so happy and giddy but I don't know how to stop, my family notices the change of personality when I'm talking to someone outside the family.

I try to make people smile because I don't like feeling like shit

I try to help people with their problems because I want someone to help with me

I try and try but in honesty I don't think there's anyone who would look out for me

I feel I like I can't talk to anyone and it's suffocating

I feel fucking trapped.
