My SO has panic disorder and it’s making me depressed.
My SO has been diagnosed for now with panic disorder (waiting on health monitor results to check to see if it’s not something else)

The last couple of months have been really hard. He has overtime gotten more worried about his health and every time is convinced that it’s cancer or something else deadly. 

He can spend hours on google about a discomfort he feels and freaks out because webmd says it one thing and another site says something else. He checks his heart rate every 15 minutes because he downloaded an app on his phone. 

I have taken him to the er multiple times in the past couple of months and each time they say that’s nothing is wrong he’s just having bad panic attacks. He won’t believe them because then he’ll go on reddit and see stories of people being misdiagnosed. I’m convinced he’s a hypochondriac.

We can’t go about one day without him saying he doesn’t feel good. It’s hard to enjoy myself whenever we go out because I’m just waiting for him to say something about not feeling good so we can just leave wherever we’re at.

I don’t know how to fully support him through this.  When he freaks out and wants to call the ambulance I don’t know if I should let him knowing that they’re just gonna say he’s fine or tell him that it’s in his head and make him feel like I’m not taking him seriously.

I feel bad for feeling this way. But it’s making me depressed. I don’t know how to go about this.
