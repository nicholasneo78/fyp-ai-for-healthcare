I'm afraid to be in a relationship
I say this because every guy who has asked me out. I just say no. I just panic and say no but I become friends with them. Then when our friendship ends because I ruined it. I feel so alone and depressed for days. Just from me writing this. It shows I'm not fit to be in a relationship with anyone or my depression will make me feel like I'm in so much pain. 
Then I also hate being alone like it would just be nice for one day to be hugged all day by a guy. I would feel more relaxed and just forget about so many things.
