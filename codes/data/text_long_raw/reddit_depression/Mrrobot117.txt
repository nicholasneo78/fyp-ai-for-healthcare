Functional depression??
Is anyone here in a similar boat? I have a bachelor degree, girlfriend, am athletic although exercise on and off. Having trouble finding a stable career but i’m optimistic. Tried getting a masters degree but it’s not working out so far. Anyways what i’m trying to say is that on paper my life seems ok, but i’ve tried a few therapists, medications and nothing is getting me out of this hole of low mood, motivation, and occasional thoughts. I still skip meals, eat junk, sleep inconsistently, have days where i’m ready to quit everything. I do have little people to talk to and feel connected with even though i have parents, and some friends. It’s been several years now like this. Does it get better? That’s what people say, am i missing something? Am i overthinking everything? Anyways thanks for reading.
