Sigh.
Sometimes I just want to fall asleep peacefully to my music, and never wake up. Sometimes I just want someone to talk to and get my mind off things. I complain too much, and I feel like a burden to them. There's only one person who understands, but he will forget me. Once that happens Ill be back to living my pathetic life again.
