I hate the way I look
I've pretty much always hated the way I looked. I just recently got a really bad haircut and I'm considering shaving my head. I'll be ugly no matter what so I guess hair or no hair won't really make a difference. I can't afford plastic surgery or else I would. It sucks being an ugly girl.
