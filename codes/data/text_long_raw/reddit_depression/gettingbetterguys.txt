Loneliness is just so crippling
I just can't handle it myself, and there's no one I can realistically ask for help because I just need so much more help than anyone can give. And I don't have nearly enough people to spread out the burden. I just don't seem capable of finding anyone who actually wants to be a real friend to me. I just feel so incredibly sad because I feel alone and I can't do anything about it.
