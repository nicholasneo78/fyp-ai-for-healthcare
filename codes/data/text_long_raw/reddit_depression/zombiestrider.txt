Been independent since 17
I have been living with my girlfriend since I was 18 and 1 year a lone. It's so discouraging to see your friends live at home, go to school, and have a chance to fail or make mistakes. I resent them almost.  I work 6 days a week and I can still bearly pay my bills. I don't get to mess up. If I fucked up I'm on the street or out of of the job. Everything is just toil toil toil, work, sleep, work. I just want a chance to be my age... I'm so tired...
