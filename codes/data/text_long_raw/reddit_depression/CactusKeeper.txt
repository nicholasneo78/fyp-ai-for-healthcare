Poem about mental illness I wrote
When you ask if I'm okay Of course I am okay. I am alive, But not quite living. I am okay but I am trapped, Watching those around me Live their lives. I am okay but I feel lost, Or rather I cannot feel at all. I am okay but I am screaming As loud as I can inside my head. I want to be heard But suffer in silence. I am okay but other's are not I make them feel helpless As they watch me sway Between okay and isolation. Isolation from others From myself From my passions. Isolated from my own feelings Sometimes there's nothing left but the dark. You feel helpless? I am helpless I am drowning in the darkness. I am okay But I'm not really here Here or there I'm everywhere My brain can't straighten up. I'm okay but I'm not living I feel trapped within myself. I am not okay.
