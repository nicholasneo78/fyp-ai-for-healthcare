The days are manageable; it's the years that get me
Day to day, aside from the struggle with getting out of bed, I can do OK. Put the mask on, survive the day, go home, go back to sleep (I guess I'm what they call high-functioning). The idea that I'm going to have to do this forever until I die makes me want to move that date up a bit.
