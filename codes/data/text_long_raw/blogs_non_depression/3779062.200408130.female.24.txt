 So, Friday the 13. Hmmmmm. Either something good will happen or something bad will happen. Or maybe it will be like the rest of my life and nothing at all will happen. I have rediscovered why I don't stage manage any more. I am so bored watching this show. And I would feel bad about sitting there and reading. Grrrr. Well, only 4 more. And if one more actor comes to me with a brilliant idea, I am going to have to kill them. Maybe if they knew all there lines or all there songs or didn't goof things up every night, I would listen to them. But I wonder why they are worried about other peoples blocking, but don't seem to care that they have no idea what they are doing.
