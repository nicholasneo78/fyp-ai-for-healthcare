 Joel, Scott, Jeremy, Graham, and I built up my new SpecialEdlized frame Saturday night. Becky and Matt brought by their fit-stick and it made things a ton easier. Special crit gorilla thanks to them for sitting through our antics....I'm just glad they left before the slap fight.   McDaniels won, hands down...or up...well, actually perpendicular. Joel's neck was the biggest casualty our unit suffered.  I wish I had more seatpost showing. My compact frame looks like a semi-sloping Mercxk. At least the top tube fits me.  A long time ago, when I rode for Chisholm, a team-mate told me I had a gorilla body and I really only race criteriums, so I'll call this blog crit gorilla.   A great friend of mine, Shawn Moore, is blogging his trip with his wife out west at moorewest.blogspot.com. I was confused and inadvertently opened a blog account when I tried to post a comment. I figured I'd write a little while I was here. Thanks for the idea Shawn.
