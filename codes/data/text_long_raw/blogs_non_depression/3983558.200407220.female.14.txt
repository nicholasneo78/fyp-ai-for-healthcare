 hey ya'all. how are you doing? i am fine today. well i just wanted to tell everyone i talk to at least that i am leaving to go to wyoming. i might of told some of you and some of you might of already knew, but it was great telling you, cuz i hope my cousins think it's kinda cool that i'm coming up to visit. some of them do but i hope the others do. also i hope they don't mind me visiting and if they do then sorry.  i really hope it will be fun when i get there; i haven't seen my cousins in at leat three years. it would break my heart if they didn't even say hi to me. but it is up to them if they want to be nice or be mean. well hope to see you or talk to you soon, or later.    ~littlebear200~
