 My internship will start tomorrow.  It sounds like a really intense place, so i'm nervous about the whole thing.  i've always fit in in office enviros really well, and i've tended to do well in those places.  i think i'll be sucessful.  i also don't think its going to be very hard at all.  i'll post tomorrow to let everyone know how it went.
