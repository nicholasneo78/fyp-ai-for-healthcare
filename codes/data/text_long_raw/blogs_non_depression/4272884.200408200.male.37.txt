 I'm not a Kerry fan. I hate Bush. I will vote for Kerry.  There, I've said it.  Kerry is not the do-all and end-all of the Alternatives to Bush.  The fact is, he is the Current Alternative to Bush. I would prefer to be passionate about who I vote FOR, as opposed to being passionate about who I'll vote AGAINST.  Unfortuately, the person who stirs emotion in me for this election is Bush, and that is who I will be voting against.  The War in Iraq has a little to do with my opinion, but truth be told, I liked Bush less than I liked Gore, so Gore got my vote.  Gore stirred zero emotion/feeling in my bones, while Bush made my skin crawl.  The little scumbag liar gave me the creeps.  From the day the Republican 'Party' announced him as their candidate, I was not going to vote for him.  That being said, the party that puts a STRONG candidate in the running will get my vote.  As it stands, the parties are putting candidates out who they feel will offend the least.  That's crap.  We don't need products who are easy to advertise.  We need leaders who will do the best for America.  Bush's entire tenure can be shown in a PowerPoint presentation.   That fucker is on vacation more than anything else.  Too bad the Democrats can't come up with a candidate who stirs more emotion than 'He's got to be better than Bush'.
