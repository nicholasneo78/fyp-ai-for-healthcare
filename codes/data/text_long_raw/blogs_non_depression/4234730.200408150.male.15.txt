 Well right now I am about to eat (yum) so I will make this a bit shorter than normal especially becauce I had a boring day. I woke up at 6:30 am :( and I at some breakfast and started to fiddle with my computer trying to get the network/internet in our new house to work. I had to work till noon cutting up the hundreds of boxes we used to move which is ok because I love my sharp knife :P The rest of the day I spent trouble shooting my home network trying to get it working with WEP encryption which most people will not know...
