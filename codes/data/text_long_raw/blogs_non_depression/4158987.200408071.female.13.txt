 Hi, I'm Tash and this is my random blog which I created for two reasons. One is because I was bored, two because I wanted a gmail account and three because I decided the world needed to hear the random Ponderings of a Nutcase. So thats me. The nutcase. I live in New Zealand in a house with a cat and a dog. And I like to be random. And my pet peeves are French keyboards, the sounds MSN makes and jingle singers. I mean who really puts on their CV, 'Ah yes, that's me. I sang in the Felix Catfood jingle.' ??? Also, I don't like Bush. At all. And I don't like Micheal Jackson because he has a dead nose and sings like a sick hippo. There are lots of things I do like though. I like melted mozerella, the number 666 - just a random thought but if there is an apocolypse, wouldn't it happen on 06/06/06? Just a random vibe - and I like redheads. I love shopping. Shoe shopping. But I hate French keyboards and porridge. I think that is enough randomness for now. More later. Tash P.S. If anyone has a gmail account they don't want well... lets just say I know a taker...
