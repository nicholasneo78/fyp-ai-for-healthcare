 For the last few days, I have had some interviews to work as a teacher in a new school still under construction.   I would love to do so. I am awaiting answer as for a second interview.    I think I can be able to do so. It's just that I don't know whether the girls I had contact with are serious or not. I told them about the salary I would like to have (the regular one for a foreign language teacher in HK) and I understand that it might not be possible.   I am already disppointed before the answer because I feel like it will be "no".
