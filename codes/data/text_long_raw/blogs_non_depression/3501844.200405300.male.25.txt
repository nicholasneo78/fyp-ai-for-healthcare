 So alot of weird shit has been happening to me lately. For some reason, a reason which ill-ludes me, I can not seem to have a normal everyday boring relationship. There always seems to be some kind of drama or opstical. One of my more intelligent female friends seems to think it's because I don't choose the right kind of women, i should remind her that there aren't many women out in the world like her. Well if anyone has any tips on what is the right kind of women, I'm open to suggestions. Maybe it's that I just don't know what I want. I suppose when one thinks about it, my issues aren't that different then anyone elses but that doesn't help me feel like i'm not alone in this deal. I guess when it comes to these situations, in the end we are all really just alone in a crowd...
