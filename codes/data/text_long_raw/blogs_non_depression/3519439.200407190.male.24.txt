 Heather and I have spent the last two weekends at weddings and over 27 hours in the car. Suprisingly we did not kill each other and got along fine.  It was a little nerve racking to perform Jessica' s wedding but it was an honor to do it. I just didn't want to screw up the day she would remember forever.      Heather is doing well since she has moved here. She has already found a job that I think she will enjoy. She is going through training right now so she is not really getting to do her actual thing yet. She is working at Church's Home for Children and will be working with kids around the 8-12 age.  She will do and excellent job.   We have officially started the wedding plans. This past Sunday we went to Guest Island Ranch in Ames to see if we could have our reception or rehearsal dinner there. It was pretty interesting especially with my overdramatic dad there.   We liked it a lot and to be honest there are not a large number of options.  So we will see on how it goes. Be praying that we can plan a fun wedding but one that is reasonable and cheap. Anyway it will be good to hear how everyone is doing.  Jake  Here is a pic of us in Germany
