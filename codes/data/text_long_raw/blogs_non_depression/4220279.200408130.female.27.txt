 I can't believe how hung over I feel today. Yet, not an ounce of booze has touched these lips. I think that it was the coming off of travel and the lack of sleep. It almost makes me giggle, that this same feeling of apathy, stomach turning and headache can be caused by something other than beer. It's also an emotional hang over of sorts. I suppose it is the factor that I was just feeling so much yesterday...But I did not want to feel...At least not on the inside. I miss sensory feeling. I think that I have closed myself off so much from the world that I have protected myself both emotionaly and physicaly. I think that the phyiscal ramifications come first...it's much easier to lie to your head than to your physical self. I truly don't really know what I'm talking about. But, it seemed to make sense at the moment.
