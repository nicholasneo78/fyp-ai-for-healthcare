 Good day my children. If you are reading this, you already know, I now have a blog.     Well school is almost over. Dear God, if this school year was moving any slower it'd be going backwards. Turns out I'm not getting straight A's, son-of-a-bitch! The end of school makes me think of Dazed and Confused, the best summer movie in the history of the world. But I just can't wait for school to end so I can fill my summer with sleeping until noon and then going outside and falling asleep by the pool. Sleeping is a skill that most don't take seriously, I can sleep whenever, or whereever I want, jealous? Well I've been ranting the whole time, which is good because I need to get it out every now and then. Well on a side note, the Sox won today, 9-0. Did Derek Lowe win a game? Wow, maybe we can keep this going, and I can't wait for the Pedro-Bonds match up. Well now that I'm an Old Navy employee I can use walkie talkies and not be made fun. Ok, I must be going now, I hope you all enjoyed and come back again, peace.
