 Millionaire say Got a big shot deal And thrown it all away but But I'm not too sure How I'm supposed to feel Or what I'm supposed to say But I'm not, not sure, Not too sure how it feels To handle every day And I miss you love  Make room for the prey 'Cause I'm coming in With what I wanna say but It's gonna hurt And I love the pain A breeding ground for hate but...  I'm not, not sure, Not too sure how it feels To handle everyday Like the one that just past In the crowds of all the people  Remember today I've no respect for you And I miss you love And I miss use love  I love the way you love But I hate the way I'm supposed to love you back  It's just a fad Part of the teenage angst brigade and I'm not, not sure, Not too sure how it feels To handle everyday Like the one that just past In the crowds of all the people  Remember today I've no respect for you And I miss you love And I miss use love  Remember two days I've no respect for you And I miss you love And I miss use love  I love the way you love But I hate the way I'm supposed to love you back
