 This is my first blog ever!! woohooo! I guess your supposed to blab about random topics that enter your head around the time you actually are sitting and have nothing better to do. I guess this is one of those times... Ummmmm... I don't like Eggplant. Yup, eggplant.  Reason you may ask? Well, it tastes bad. Um, yeah. Its just bad. I mean it starts out all purple and ends up all white and squishy. Bleh. Uhh... I just realized that maybe this isn't the best topic for a first blog post, and that it is probably a bad topic all together. Soo... let talk about you! Wait, never mind. Thats worse then eggplant.  Well, if your actually reading this then... you should write a blog because you obviosly have nothing better to do.  Errrm... Bye?
