 Ahhh, So after a talk with a friend and a weekend in the country I'm much calmer. Saturday was absolutely wonderful. JB and I went to a farmer's market, went swimming then fell asleep on the grass in the shade. The relaxation was much needed and I feel soo great. Oh, we went shopping on Friday and I spent way too much money. I got some supper cute heels though. I've always been into girlie things. I love pink but this season is making it sooo much easier to be into pink. I love it. I bought little pink heels with wonderful tiny black bows on the side. I also bought a bunch of "work" clothes. I'm soo happy!
