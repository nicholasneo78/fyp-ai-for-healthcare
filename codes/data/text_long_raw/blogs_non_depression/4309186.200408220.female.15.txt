 Acts 20:24--  But my life is worthless unless I use it for doing the work addignes me by the Lord Jesus--the work of telling others the Good News about God's wonderful kindess and love.        Unless I am living my life to do the    work of God  ,    then my life is  worthless.  Not sharing  Christ 's  love  with anyone and everyone is something that should make me feel   guilty  . And I can honestly say that it does. Living 4 Christ    24/7  is my title because I feel like I am supposed to live for Him  24/7 !      Galations 2:20--  I myself no longer live, but Christ lives in me. So I live my life in this earthly body by trusting in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.       Like what I said in the first one, my life is  worthless  unless I use it to share God's love. Well, I cannot do it alone, so Christ lives in me to   help   me and to   guide   me. Allowing  God to live inside of me , gives me a great deal of  comfort.  How else could you feel more comfortable? Having the Son of God inside your  heart  and knowing that He loves you and would do   anything   for you...that's and   amazing   feeling! And I'm so glad that I get to experience it   everyday!
