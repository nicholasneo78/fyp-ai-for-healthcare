 Pretty uneventful week, but I am starting my own RPG  using RPG maker 2003. The title is Seal of the  Ancients: A Hero is Born. I am currently working on  the plot and characters and I have a good bit of  graphics for it. I will post news on it as I get more  done on it. I will also include screenshots and parts  of the story. Thats all that really happened. I also  have a lot of energy all of a sudden. I feel like  getting outside and doing all kinds of things. But  it's getting late so I'll do stuff tommorrow. I write  whenever I can/feel like it/have the time.
