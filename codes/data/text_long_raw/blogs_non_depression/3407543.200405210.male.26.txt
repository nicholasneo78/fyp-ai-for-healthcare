 So, it is Friday. I am at work hoping that I am successfully pretending to be working. I do hope it works. My current job is easy to spot. Just go to  urlLink Pravda.sk  and a lot of what you see is a result of my clicking and typing. Yes, you've guessed it right. I am an online journalist surfing the news agencies for the fresh news that I may together with my co-workers offer to the hungry Slovak online audience.   Today is one especially dull day as Fridays often are. So I watch the bubbles bubbling in my mineral water bottle on my desk. It is quite relaxing, but it makes me want to pee too often. That is the price you pay.  Fridays are often filled with expectations of the coming weekend, but not today. See the rason:  The forecast forecasts forbiddingly nasty stormy rainy ugly weather.   That would not worry me too much, but it has been so nice and hot during the working days when I just had to sit here and satisfy the hunger for the news of several thousands of people. Oh well, I should better be going... read you later.
