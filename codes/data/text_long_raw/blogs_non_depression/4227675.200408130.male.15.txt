 Well, there's nobody online to talk to. So I figure, mise well talk to myself. I've seen a few of these things around and It's always interesting to see what other people do. Not saying that I'm all that interesting, but, oh well.       Today not alot happend. Woke up, played Nascar Thunder 2004 for a few minutes. Short attention span, so that didnt last long. Me and phish went outside and I threw the ball for him for about an hour. Then Ralph called and I went to his house and we just fucked around. We walked up to spads and hung out with Brady Crights and Eric...uhh I forgot his last name. Oh well. Went to McDonalds for dinner cuz dad was to lazy to make something....Now I'm here. Sitting on the computer...Talking to myself. Anyways, I guess that's all for now. Peace.      Casey~
