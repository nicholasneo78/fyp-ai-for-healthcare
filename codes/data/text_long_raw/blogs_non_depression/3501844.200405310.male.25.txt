 car shopping today went well. i'm really looking at two cars, the nissan spectra and the a saturn coupe. both have the basics that i want, sporty look, power everything, sunroof, standard transmission etc. the spectra has got more balls than the saturn but i think i'll get a better deal with the saturn. this is my first experiance buying a NEW car. soo many choices, i feel like a kid in a candy store..hehe  still no real resolution on the female issue. seems as though it get more complicated whichever way i go, so i think my plan is going to be to just ride out the storm and hope for a better days in the future. i know i know not a very creative solution but i honestly can't think of anything else.  on a different note i was thinking about the relationship my generation has with their work. my parents worked three jobs when they were younger and to this day i haven't know them to complain about it. they saw it as a chance to make money and as simply doing what you needed to do. it's strange that just one generation later we see people who can barely handle working one fulltime job and endlessly complain about how much they do. i really believe if we worked harder as a generation we would not only do better personally but do more for each other. not to get too religious but catholics believe that forgiveness/redemption is not based on faith alone but also on good deeds. maybe if we did more for each other on a regular basis we would all be better off, then again that's just my opinion...
