 Ahhh... This is my first time writing a blog and I am happy that i am. What an interesting name. BLOG. I spent the night at my friends house and we had a lot of fun playing Counter- Strike. He's so happy that Im getting him an airsoft gun for his birthday.  I cant wait for my friend Mike to come back from piano camp.  I also cant believe that he got wasted up there in Stockton, CA. I need to do more exploring on this website.
