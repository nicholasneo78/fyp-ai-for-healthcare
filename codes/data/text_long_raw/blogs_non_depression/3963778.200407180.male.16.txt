 So, the story goes something like this:     It was 3pm on a sunday afternoon. I was bored and couldnt think of anything to do. "I know! Google!"     Well, I couldnt find anything very interesting on google, so i decided to setup a blog. And then I started typing stuff, and well, you can read that here... wait, you already have.     Anyways, this is out of pure boredom and does not in anyways reflect my beleifs or sexuality. So get a life and stop reading peoples blogs.     Yah, thats what I said, GO AWAY!
