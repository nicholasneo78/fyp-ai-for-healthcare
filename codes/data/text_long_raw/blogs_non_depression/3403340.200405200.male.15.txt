 O.K.  It looks as though i have a blog.  WHat i mean to say is... this is my blog, or the blog that is this, belongs to me.  After an excrutiating million trillion billion hours of trying to find an adress that wasnt taken, i got one. It's something like: arg stop being unavailable, and, LO AND BEHOLD.... (success).  THus begins my journey into blogging and being blogged in return... I wonder if when you say "blogging" it has the double consanant, or if it just holds its own against the common rules of the english language and presents itself as a non-double consanant word.  Whew... I'm spent, time to get off to my REAL friends, Zola on aol... shes a blast. She calls me jesus or satan or even calafornia (that is if i wanted her to.)  I;m refering to a computer as if it were a person. Now i really need to go.
