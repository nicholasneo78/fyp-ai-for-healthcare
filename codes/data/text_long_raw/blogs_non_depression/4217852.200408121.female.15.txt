 You meet a man   And realize he's been in your dreams   Although you've never seen him before   He stands in front of you now   And yet   He doesn't see you the way you see him      You seem invisible   You check to see if you're still there   You see a motionless body and a sad face   You see pain and you know you're there   And yet   You still seem invisible      You talk to this dream man   Is he listening?   What are you saying?   The salty wetness runs down your face   And yet   Your skin is dry      He opens his mouth   Is he going to say something?   Does he know you're there?   You become eager for what happens next   And yet   He just yawns      You turn around and begin to walk away   Your face is red and embarrassed   Your heart is full of shame   Your dreams are shattered   And yet   He follows you      Where are you going?   Why is he following you?   You look behind you   He turns around and walks the other away   And yet   You can't move      You watch him walk away   He becomes out of sight   You can move again like a bird   You walk in the opposite direction of him   And yet   You can only dream
