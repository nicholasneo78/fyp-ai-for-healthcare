 Okay, folks. Raise your hands if you think it'd take two days to clean a one bedroom apartment from top to bottom. No hands? Well, join the club. Unfortunately, that's how long it took me to get this lovely place I call home clean. But now I look around, and it's great, cleaner than it's ever been. So all that hard work paid off in the end.  The weather outside is gorgeous, and I'm listening to music on my computer as I type this. Why did I just tell you that? Well, that's what it's like here right now. I'm also waiting for Kristen to get home, so we can go out and have fun. So drop me a line sometime, any of y'all who might read this. Lookin' forward to hearin' from you soon.
