 Hi there, my name as you can see, is Brock.  I've been looking everywhere for a place for me to express myself, Thank you blogger.com.  I'm starting this school year as a junior, just turned sixteen, not looking for a girlfriend, because i've found one...she doesn't know it yet though...well, i guess i'll create a profile now...if you want to know more about me, head there.  ps, this is what part of the alphabet would look like if q and r were eliminated.
