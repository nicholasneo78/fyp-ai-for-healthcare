 yeah so tonight i went to the movies with chris, erin and adrienne...and see the problem is this...i really like erin, and i havent really told her, because i know she'd think i was a little rapist since we've only talked online and a little bit in person haha, but what i have seen of her i like a lot, and besides, shes likes nirvana and alcohol..god she is def the one for me haha..back to my problem tho, i dont know if she likes me or not..i mean online shes not very enthusiastic, but its not just to me, and when i see her in person she seems cool, and she leaned against me kinad in the movies, but idk if any of that was just coincidence or what..cuz obviously rejection blows, and idk if i should wait later to tell her or ask her out for that matter lol..because also i gave her a comment about her skin earlier tonight online and she was like "yeah i went to flordia" and then was like buuut im gunna go watch tv then sleep..later...and i was like wait r u comming back or passing out? and she was like "out"...then "gnight" after i said it, then got off??..idk if thats just the way she is online or if she was sketched about the comment or what ahhh! but god...i like that girl so much she seems so awesome
