 Church was so much fun last night especially when we had the banana and orange eating contest.  You might be asking why it was so much fun, well the reason why is because you could only use one hand to eat both of them and I beat 4 other people!   Levi, Jessi, Joni, AJ, and everyone else knows how fun that was.  After church I went to one of bestest friends house, we ended up staying up until like 5 in the morning!  We ate Burger King for dinner and had Taco Bell at like 2am.  When we got to the window at Taco Bell we could not stop laughing, I wonder if the guy thought we were high (Levi knows what I'm like at 2am lol).  That's about all that we did.   Hey Sarah!  It was so good to see you at church, since I haven't seen you your graduation party.  Next time that I talk to you I will tell you who the peom is about.   Sorry that I don't have any more wonderful writings for you, Sarah and Levi, but I will try and write something later, so that way you will really know how I feel!  Love ya! ~Chel'C
