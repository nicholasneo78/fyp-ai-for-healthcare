 so this weekend, my husband and i are heading to oklahoma so he can scuba in a lake it should be interesting. I will be watching from the land.  he is going to be a "body" for scuba people to "find" as part of a search and rescue class.  He used to scuba dive a lot in the past - he swears he saw a shark while diving in Hawaii, though couldn't take a picture of it underwater- guess he was too freaked out or something.  we'll see how it goes.
