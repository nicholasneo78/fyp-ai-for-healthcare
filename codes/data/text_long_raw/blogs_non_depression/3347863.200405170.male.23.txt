 That's Right, my site Http://www.geocties.com/twisted_balloons/  will be updated soon and the new improved version should be on-lined by tuesday or wensday at the latest. preferablly tonight, but realistically, it will be up tommorow night, as it will take me time and I have to be off-line during the day due to phone constrants.  When it is updated let me know what you think of the new look, go ahead and check it out now and let me know what you think of the current, very basic look as well.  TwistBs Signing off for another night.
