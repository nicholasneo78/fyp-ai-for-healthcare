 Adventures always start in the most unlikely ways. A random email from someone with the courage to think outside the box ( thanks Si!) has tempted me to dip my toes in the world of the weblog. I don't know where this will lead, if anywhere, but a chance to unjumble some of the thoughts racing round my head can only be a good thing! I think everyone reaches a point where they have to stop and say, is this really the life that God has mapped out for me or am I just imposing his hand on my own faltering steps down the expected path. It's not that I think I'm in the wrong place physically, I just think maybe I'm on the wrong level. I think the catalyst has been the birth of my daughter. Two big blue eyes watch every move I make with unnerving concentration, taking in the things other people may have glossed over in the past. Suddenly I realise that what I say may count for very little as, seeing everything, she's going to see the truth. Don't get me wrong, there are lots of positives, I'm just ready for more. I suppose I'm just looking for a way to let my mind spill on to the screen and see if what lands there starts to make some sense!
