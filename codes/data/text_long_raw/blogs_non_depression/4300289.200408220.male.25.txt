 Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh man, I always hate Sunday mornings because of what I do on Saturday nights!  I really should be working on the new  urlLink Urban Boy of the Week  page, because a few of you guys have e-mailed me about it.  I'm not sure that's gonna happen today, though, because I am really HUNG (over) ... haha.  I think today may be a day of rest!  BTW, if you want to be the VERY FIRST featured hottie for Urban Boy of the Week, now is a good time to let me know!  E-mail me at:  urbanboys AT hotmail DOT com
