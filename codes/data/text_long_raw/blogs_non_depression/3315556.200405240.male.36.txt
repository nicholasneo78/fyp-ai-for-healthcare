 The purpose of this blog is to track my progress as my life takes a new direction.  After a few years of drifting I've set a new path; new life goals.  I will also use this blog to reflect on current events and my reaction to them.  I've been reading blogs for a couple of years now so it I've decided to take the plunge.  Hopefully I will not bore anyone to tears.
