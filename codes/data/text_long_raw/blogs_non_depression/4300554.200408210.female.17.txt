 Our car is broken, my computer is broken, the kitchen is broken, the little oven is broken, I have a bird with a broken wing.  I guess it was broken week and nobody told me.  So, yeah, my first post here starts with some complaingin words, like always.  And expect a lot more, complaining is my mid name after all. :P
