 I finally gave in. I spent six years in a Theatre department (I wasn't the most devoted student) and somehow avoided Karaoke, but last night I made my way down to the Bandana Brewery in lovely Mankato for Tuesday night karaoke. It was just as bad as I thought it would be. I know some people go for the comedy aspect, but to me it just seemed sad, not to mention new-countryish. I mean, I don't want to hear the Dixie Chicks sing a Dixie Chicks song; why would I want to hear tone-deaf drunkards sing a Dixie Chicks song. The one bright spot was the older couple who sang classic country. They had pipes. The guy did a nicely phrased version of  Folsom Prison Blues , and the woman did a sweet and sad  Crazy.  It almost made it worth sitting through the 5'6" cat in shades who jerked his shoulders through Metallica.
