 Well its back to work today, ugh! I had such a nice weekend, I really dont feel like putting in 12 hours today. We put the new awning up, painted the shed floor and installed a new security light, and still had time to watch a movie : Talking Lives.........a very scarey movie with alot of twists, needless to say I liked it.
