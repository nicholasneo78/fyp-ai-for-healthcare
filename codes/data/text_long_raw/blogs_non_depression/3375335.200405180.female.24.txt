 so my friend debbie does this and I thought that it could be good for me. Sometimes I feel like I have to be a certain way for certain people and I thinkt that I need some place that I can just be myself. With no one judging or telling me what to say or what not to say. Today the 3 year old was really cranky and all I wanted to do was go back to bed. It drives me nuts when the parents are here and just don't do anything. I mean what is the point? well I am going to go get some stuff ready.. yea later
