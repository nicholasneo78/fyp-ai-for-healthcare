 Here it is the beginning of the third week of my shortened Summer Semester at City College of San Francisco.  I am taking Physiology as the first of 2 prerequisites I need to apply for a Masters of Nursing program.  If anyone reading this blog does NOT find this interesting I don't blame you.  But for me, out of school for over 10 years its a HUGE shock to my system.  I'll reflect more on this tomorrow and start working in some politics!
