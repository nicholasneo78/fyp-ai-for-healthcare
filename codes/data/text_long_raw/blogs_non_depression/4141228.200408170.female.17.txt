 Wow, yep I havent written in here in like two weeks atleast, but I'm not gonna try to put a shitload of stuff in here. I got my senior pictures back yesterday, and they're actually pretty good. Or atleast like 4 of em are... I'm hoping that I'll still be able to get professional ones, even though I don't really need them haha it's just fun to have your picture taken man.  I've still got to read this god-awful book for English ...Heart of Darkness... one kid put it very nicely:     "This is one of the most poorly and confusingly done novels ever written. With such an interesting plot, I was amazed at how utterly boring and clouded the novel became, the only reason this novel is still in print is because english teachers get hard-ons through mental masturbation trying to analyze this overly ambiguous work."
