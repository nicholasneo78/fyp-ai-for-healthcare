 Today i got my streamyx done. So happy about it and i've been downloading mp3s since i came back from work hehe... Ergh but kinda sad because all my cdrom are with my bf. I want to install ragnarok malay version at my pc. Oh well , i just have to wait for him to send it over... Still can't forget him.., tho kodok have make my feelings towards HH fading.. hmm but i hate to know that so many girls call up my bf even tho when we're dating. They really have no manners.. MF !! I think si kodok also layan them all,if not how come they want to call him? Erghh when i think of all that, i feel like i wanna clash. But erm.. like i said.. what i am now.., preventing me to go much further or making any quick decision. Even when it comes to HH, i'm restricted.., i can't go much further.. to know him or whatsoever. But deep down inside... i really really want to see him again and again..Err adios !
