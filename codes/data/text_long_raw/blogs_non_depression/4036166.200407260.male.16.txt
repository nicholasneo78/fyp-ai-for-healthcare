 I decided to make my own blog today.  I might have fun with it, editing the the template and all to the best of my abilities. (I don't know much HTML)    Yeah, yesterday was my birthday.  I turned 16.  I don't have a car, I'll be getting my license soon, though.  I went to Benihana's to eat.  It's a japanese restaurant where they prepare the food right in front of you with these cooking tables.  The food was really good, especially the fried rice.     A list of everything I got from friends and family:   - Kodak EasyShareCX7300 digital camera -Computer/desk chair -The Bourne Identity DVD -Hot Shots DVD -Naked Gun DVD -$60 -$22 -$20 gift card to the local media store (FYE) -A cut rock, it's really beautiful.  Came with a stand. -Two "hoodies".  I love "hoodies".   With the money I had I purchased:  -The Matrix: Revolutions DVD -Sealab 2021: Season 1 DVD -Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Volume 2 DVD -Snowboard Kids (video game) -Gun Valkyrie (video game) -Mad Maestro (video game)  That's about it for my birthday, oh yeah there was a good cake.  It's half yellow cake and half chocolate cake.  It's covered with vanilla icing, and there are some balloons.  It's really good.  Wow I just realized how dull this must be for people.  Well I thank anyone who takes time to read this stuff.
