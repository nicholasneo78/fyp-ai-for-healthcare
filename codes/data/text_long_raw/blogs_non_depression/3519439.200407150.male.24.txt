 Hey how is everyone. Heather has moved here and we are doing really well. We  spent 17 hours in the car this past weekend going to my friend Jared's  wedding and we will be going to Jessica's wedding theis weekend. we haven't  killed each other so that is really impressive. I am a little tense about  the wedding but I guess that is good otherwise I would probably be terrible.  I guess I still might.  Heather is doing really well.  She has been handling the move well even though I know she misses her  friends back in Colorado.  I am considering taking a Youth Ministry position at Fellowship of the  Metroplex. It is a fairly large church wich I am not a big fan of but I am  praying over with Heather and we need your prayers to help us with the  decision. We are also considering some other options of ministry and would  appreciate your prayers. Thanks for everyone's help and support.  Jake
