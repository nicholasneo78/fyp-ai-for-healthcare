 i was just watching apocalypse now and ive realised that napalm is your friend, your very best friend, and she will care for you- she just wants your soul first, here's how to make her:  the last time i made it, mine was very basic- 1 part gasoline to 2 parts animal blood. This solidified into a type of gel, not very stable ( a bit like me) but lethally flammable and sticky.  But a revised method is to pour some gasoline into an old container and force it to eat up styrofoam-you can even use the little white balls from the inside of a bean bag- untill it wont take anymore, this dries into a form of foam itself, with a wet slice at the bottom, tie some into a soggy ball and wrap with cling film to seal it and you have a perfect pocket rocket for throwing into a car window or something else that wants to burn, you could even hook up a basic fuse into it and run away, very fast indeed, because if you have tied the cling film on tightly enough it will just explode big time, superb.
