 Well I spent time with some of my many friends.  The people I hang out with most are Richard, Matt, and Zach.  Well they were over today, so we decided to go to the mall.  I LOVE music video games.  And I had been looking for a PS2 game called "Rez" for awhile.  Well, I found it today.  I found Rez at the mall media store called FYE.  It was $31.99 but it was well worth it, since it's an awesome and very rare game.  I also purchased a CD at FYE.  It's "The Best of, The Church".  I love the band, The Church, and this CD is great.  It has 17 songs on it, and I love all of them.  After the mall, we all came back to my house and played video games/watched funny things on the internet/listened to music.  I love spending time with my friends.
