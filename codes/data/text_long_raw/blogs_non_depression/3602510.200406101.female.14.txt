 Looks like an other boring summer.  But this time I am with out my two best friends. Well they used to be my best friends.  I don't think I did anything but we more have just grown apart.  I have just completed my first year of high school.  Now I am really wondering where the time went. I can't even remember what I did most of this year.  But I guess that is just high school.   right now my life is kinda a mess. For starters my parents are ganging up on me and it is getting really old. And my sister is being a real bitch to me.  When he bf gets back from Hawaii she will be back to normal...I hope.  Then there is my love life.  Right now it is taking a break because my bf is working at a summer camp and I can only see him when he comes home on Saturdays. Which really sucks.  He is a junior, my parents hate that I am dating him. They would rather have me date someone my own age.  But if you know me you know that telling me not to do something will make me want it more. Some of my guy friends were upset when I told them about my bf.  They are a bit protective of me. And they are all like brothers to me except for one...
