I’m so alone...
I’m almost 20 and I’ve never been in a relationship before. I’ve only been rejected by 4 guys and 2 girls. One of them is my closest friend. He says that if I was a girl he would be with me. This makes me feel like I have to change myself in order to be his. Even then I still don’t think he’ll be with me. I’m in love with him because he’s one of the only people who makes me feel like I matter. I just wonder if I’m even going to have anyone in the future... Dating websites/apps are also out of the question because no one wants to talk to me no matter how hard I try.
