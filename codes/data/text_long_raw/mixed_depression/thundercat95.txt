I adopted a cat
Ive been suicidal and planning it out. I went with a friend to look at the humane society for dogs and while we were there my friend wanted to look at cats. 

One named frankie took a liking to me and was super affectionate. I ended up taking him home today. He meows a ton and im thinling of naming him meowskers (dont judge me)

Update - to people asking for a pic i dont really have a good photo yet but i posted on my page a quick clip of me meeting him. I look like shit cause ive been depressed but the clip cheers me up so oh well.
