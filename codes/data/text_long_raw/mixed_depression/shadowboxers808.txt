Coping With Depression with False Laughter
Does anyone here try to combat their depression with laughter and jokes when dealing with people?

I've been known by my friends to be the jokester, the guy that makes people laugh.  What none of them know is that I do it because I'm trying hard to not to feel depressed, and I'll try to make a joke out of a lot of stuff.  Sarcasm is my friend.  It makes me feel good for a little while, but eventually the happy feeling from laughter returns to feeling like crap.
