A poem to vent
So lately I've been unable to write at all. So I decided that if I can't get the inspiration, I'm writing about why I can't get this inspiration, and instead of writing another dadaistic poem I tried to do something you guys might like, so I want to share it.

 inb4: This is the first poem I'm writing in english so yeah. I hope you enjoy it, even though I couldn't think of a title


**Goddamn Shit**

No Focus on Nothing  
Nothing stays in Focus  
Why the fuck can't I be  
somebody else's Focus  


***



When I start to write  
My whole mind goes white  
"You wann' cry tonight?"  
I wish I could tonight  


***


I can't wait to sleep  
But I'm afraid of dreams  
The thought of morrow  
makes my mind go scream  


***


Cold sheets, I wait to sleep   
Everyday, everyday, repeat.  


***



So that's it, I hope you've enjoyed it, I'd reeeaaally appreciate any feedback on it, and I hope that you're having a great week!

EDIT: Formatting is hard ok
