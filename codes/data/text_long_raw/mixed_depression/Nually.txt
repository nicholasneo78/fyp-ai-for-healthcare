Why would people keep telling me “you’re a good person”, I don’t feel like I’m a good person.
Yesterday my best friend sent me a text telling me “you’re a good person, you’ll find someone.” 
All I could think was no I don’t want to find just someone, I wanna be with someone who resembles the guy I can’t forget. Not anybody will do and if I’m such a good person he would have stayed friends with me.

My mother said everyone I’m close with or knows me well including my aunt, relatives all of them wants me to take care of someone either their own daughter meaning my aunts and then other cases my elder sister because they could see I have a good heart but then she ended the conversation with when you have a lover/boyfriend you’ll forget about me, about us. Which judging by past experiences her words has some truth in it. 

In my mind all of this is some kind of a cosmic joke because I don’t think I would find someone like him who’d be interested in me. This leads to nowhere, I feel so sick and tired of it all already their expectations and my lack of motivation to improve myself and poor sense of self-worth.
