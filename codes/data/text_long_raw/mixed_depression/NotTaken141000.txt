Working 9-5 ain't no way to make a living.
So ignoring the pun, I seriously have no interests in what carreer I want when I'm older (im 17, kicked out of collage) I don't know if this is he depression but after working overtime on my shitty Saturday job I have had 5days work in a row and without sounding like a lazy cunt who has never worked. I genuinely have never been so fucking depressed, all I have done is wake up at 8. Work all day, not said a word to anyone been depressed all day, got in, all my mates are out enjoying summer and don't speak to me or anything. I usually get in at about 6pm I eat tea then shower then do nothing for a few hours until I go to bed and repeat. Without sounding too dramatic, I can't do this for the rest of my life. I don't want to work. I know you have to but why? I don't want to do something I don't want to do, I don't understand why the world is this way and it makes me super fucking depressed. I have no hobbies and I just feel like pure shit.
