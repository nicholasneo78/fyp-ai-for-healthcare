Why is life horrible to me and only me
It just seems like one bad thing after another.  Every time I try to reach out and open up to people it just goes down in flames. They always be like , no your not depressed , its your fault that your this way and only you can helped yourself. Always shunning me away and ignoring me. Then its always my fault. You didn't help with the decorations its your fault it failed.
