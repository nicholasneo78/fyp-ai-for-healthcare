I'm having a good day.
Taking the advice of others in this sub, I'm going to try to remember how this feels. And try to remember that it is possible to not feel sad, even if it's just for a day and the happiness is slight. I hope to remember this so that when I'm down the sadness tunnel again, things won't look completely hopeless.

I hope you guys get to feel it too. At least a small breather from drowning in sadness.
