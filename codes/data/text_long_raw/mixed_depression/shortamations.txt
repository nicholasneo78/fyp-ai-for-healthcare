Does anyone want to just exchange some compliments?
Hey! I know a lot of you are having a rough time out there, and some of you are having one of those nights where things aren't looking too good. I'm having one of those right now. I think we can all benefit from just a session of telling each other the truth, that we all matter. We are all beautiful. We are all worth it. 

I'm going to post this and go to sleep, but I promise you all that I will respond to each and every person who comments when I wake up. I love you guys! Feel free to start without me :p
