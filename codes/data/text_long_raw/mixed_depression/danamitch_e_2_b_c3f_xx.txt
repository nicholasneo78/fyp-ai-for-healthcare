I am 43 years old and I still feel that I'm dealing with my parents' terrible marriage.  I feel like I don't know anyone else who is in this situation.  I have teenage children and have found that I can't just move away because they are so embedded in their school and friends, but sometimes, just once and for all, I want to live away from my folks. Their marriage has always been terribly dysfunctional and now it is much worse as they are older. When I was young, it was awful, but I still felt like there was some love there. Now, I fell like I witness nothing but hatred between them.  I have confronted them many times - but, there is a strong sense of manipulation whenever this happens and I am left feeling that it is somehow my fault that I don't want to be around miserable people - Any suggestions? How can I finally live my own life?  I'm really depressed tonight. I feel like I can't continue living like this. I am a grown women and I'm still living around and letting my parents' miserable marriage effect me.
