Starting antipressants
Hi, I'm a male in my early 30's and going to meet with an intake doctor tomorrow. I will probably wind up on antidepressants, so I have been looking up the side effects, and REALLY don't want to have erectile dysfunction and gain weight. 

Do any males have experience with taking medicine and their effects?
