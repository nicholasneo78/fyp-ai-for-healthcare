Two things kept me alive today
Firstly, I have not yet hiked across Iceland. 

Secondly, if I were to be gone, who would feed my fish? Nobody would, they’re like dollar fish. They’d die and then thirteen other lives would be on me. 

So here I am. I don’t know if it’s sad that literally those two things are about all that keep me here or good that I can still find humor in all this.
