I feel like I'm a terrible person for being sad
My life is going fine: I have solid grades, I hardly have to study, and I'm financially stable. However, even though everything is going great I'm still sad every day, and spend a lot of time thinking about how to kill myself.
No one notices that I'm sad, and everyone thinks I must be really happy about how everything is going, and it just makes me feel worse that I can't be happy even when I have everything: every victory is hollow and ever action feels pointless.

I don't even know who to talk to about this because I don't want to bother anyone, people have enough to worry about without me involving them in my problems, especially small ones like my feelings.
