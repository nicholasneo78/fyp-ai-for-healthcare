fuck.
so my ex who I miss like a lot and who moved away because she hated me so much is apparently coming back next year and...

I just want to die. I really just want to kill myself this summer or at least move away.

I don't think I can handle that.

I just don't want to live anymore it's killing me why does she have to come back why can't she just let me be alone and forget that I ever wasn't

aaaaahhhhhhhhh

now I'm going to have to look over my fucking shoulder every five seconds when I'm in the hallways and just fuck me straight to hell if we end up having any classes together I can't fucking stand myself so I know she can't aaahhh

I don't want to make her angry but I know just my presence in general will fuck

I dunno I finally got people to forget about it and stop asking about what happened and I don't want it to start again I just wish I could forget everything or die 

I wish we could both forget and not know each other I think she'd be a lot happier she used to say she was happy she knew me but now knowing me makes her absolutely miserable and I think she'd be a lot happier overall if she never did.

I hope I die I can't handle this well I don't want to I'm so fucking pathetic I hope I die she does too so I should I'm sooooo tired I just want to die I don't think I can stand seeing her face in the halls every day again I just can't
