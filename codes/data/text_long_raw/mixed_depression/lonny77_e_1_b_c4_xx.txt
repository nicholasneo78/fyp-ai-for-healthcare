I'm a single white gentleman, 27. I've dealt with depression since the age of 7, and it has gotten worse over the years. Not having any family / friends is not helping any (it's been this way for years now). My depression got really bad when I graduated from high school and my parents turned their backs on me. While everyone else was looking forward to a bright future, my parents had the attitude of "screw you, you're on your own". They refuse to help me in any way, which has caused unbelievable problems for me (unemployment being the biggest thing). Having a friend is not the cure - all, but it would definitely help a lot. I feel so hopeless and alone. I tried other internet groups, but found them to be nothing but a waste of time. Just looking for someone who can relate, and won't judge me. I am fully aware that this is not a dating site, but I would prefer to find a female friend. If anyone is interested and / or has any questions about me, feel free to contact me.
