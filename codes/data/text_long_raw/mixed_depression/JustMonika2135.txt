Why does anyone care?
Its not like my life can get any better it doesn't do no good talking to anybody either because I just end up turning them against me my best friend a guy that I look up to as a brother doesn't even want anything to do with me anymore. I'm just absolutely pathetic just absolutely pathetic even if I can't join back with them I would at least like to talk to them and help them out if I could if not then what's the point I know they're tired of seeing me post about them and I can't help it they're my friends whether they want to admit it or not and I care about them very much. :(
