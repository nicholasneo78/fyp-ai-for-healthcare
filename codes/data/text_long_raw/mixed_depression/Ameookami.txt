All I've wanted for years is to die. Idk how to want anything else anymore
I'm not even that stick anymore. I just don't feel like life is worth living at least not my life. I don't want to do anything. Its all just effort. And for what?  It never makes me happy. I might as well climb in bed and never get out of it. I'm not happy anyway what difference if other people aren't happy with me. Whats the point? Nothing is happy in my life and I don't care enough to change that.
