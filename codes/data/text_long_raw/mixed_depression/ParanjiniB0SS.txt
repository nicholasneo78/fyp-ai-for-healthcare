Embarrassing myself at volleyball tryouts
I'm a freshman in high school and we just did volleyball tryouts and they were fucking horrible. I had to wake up at 5:30 to go to them because they started at 6. Literally everyone there was better than me. I fucking hate everything. I'm such a failure. Like everyone was doing actual spikes and sets and shit and I was just there. They probably thought I was in special ed. At least if I had a mental disability I would have an excuse to be so shit at volleyball. I'm probably gonna quit tbh. I've never wanted to die more in my life. And I know you're probably gonna say do your best and I am but my best isn't good enough. This is what I get for trying to be less depressed using a sport. I don't even look like I'm in high school,I'm just a short 5'0 Indian kid
