So tired of thinking about suicide and being sad I feel I want to die to rest
I wait and wait and wait but this time my sadness and anxiety doesn't go away. It physichaly pains. I hate myself for crying publicly every day at the street or caf√©s. Sometimes I think that an angel will appear to help me for being crying so much. Writing it here is the only thing that helps
