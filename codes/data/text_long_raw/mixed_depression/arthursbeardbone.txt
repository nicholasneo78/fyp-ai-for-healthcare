I am so fucking unbearably lonely
I have no job, no friends. and nothing even close to an SO. I've never even been on a date. That's a pipe dream of course I wouldn't date someone as disgusting as me so why should anyone else in the first place. But I can't stop desperately wanting to be loved, to be touched. not even sexually necessarily tho that too, but just be held, kissed. Anyone, I don't give a fuck anymore boy or girl just someone anyone please It's never happened and it feels like it never will. I feel like I'm starving to death. I can't shake this need I've never really felt before and it's every damn minute. it's so damn funny though I shrink away from even the slightest of contact with another human, in the rare occasion I'm in public I bury myself in my phone and hope desperately no one acknowledges me. no one ever does but I'm always still afraid they will. how fucking pathetic, isn't it. add this to the list of things that make me wanna rip my skin open
