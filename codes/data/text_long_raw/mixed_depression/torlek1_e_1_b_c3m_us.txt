My weight is ballooning out of control.

I take daily:

40 MG of Prozac (in the morning);  1 MG Klonopin (same time): 1 MG Klonopin (5 PM) 1 MG Klonopin (bedtime), prescribed by a psychiatrist.

I also take 1000 MG Keppra at bedtime for migraine prevention (prescribed by a neurologist).

I've been on various combinations of these for a couple of years.

The psychiatrist is doggedly insistent that the medications I'm on shouldn't be making me gain weight - but nonetheless they are.  I've had other medications that have given me side effects that I "shouldn't" have had - but nonetheless I do.

I have read many, many stories on the internet and through direct conversation with others that say they have had exactly the same things happen with SSRI's.

When I've asked him to change the medication, he keeps preaching "diet and exercise".  It hasn't worked.  I'm now down to the point where I eat virtually nothing and today I exercised to the point where I nearly blacked out.

This is causing problems between my wife and I (she also sees the same psychiatrist and takes Klonopin and Effexor), not least because I have no sexual desire.  None.

She sees him (the psychiatrist) tomorrow but I don't see him until April 6.

Yesterday in my therapy session I had an angry outburst that maybe I should just quit taking all the medication (because maybe I'm over medicated) and she didn't like that too much.

Am I going to have to die of obesity or over exercise to get his attention?  What do I have to do to convince them?

This is not helping my depression any when I can't stand to even look at myself in the mirror.
