Depression and grief
I am a 28 yr old M, who has been diagnosed with treatment resistant MDD from the age of 16.

Recently, I was attempting to get into a ketamine study in a NYC hospital and was asked a number of questions about my background. One item which came up that I have not thought about in a while was the specifics of my uncles suicide when I was around 13. 

My uncle was a 28 yr old gay M, developed HIV and killed himself. Though this is not what I was initially told. It took around 10 years with every year or so getting a new piece of information. Initially I was told he had cancer and died. Then I was told he had cancer and my grandparents "pulled the plug". Then I was told he was gay, had cancer, and my grandparents "pulled the plug". Then I was told he was gay, had HIV, and my grandparents "pulled the plug". Then, finally, I was told he was gay, had HIV and killed himself.

I think I secretly had an understanding of how he had killed himself even when I was a kid and was not told due to subtle hints that kids will typically pick up on. Even if I did not, I always had the feeling that something was wrong and that my parents were not truthful.

After discussing his death for two hours for the study, I realized that the depression I have been feeling for over 12 years is so similar to the feeling I get when I think of my uncle. Intense grief. I delved into the feeling more and have not been able to stop crying for the past few days about my uncle. 

Does this make sense from a psychological stand point to be greiving for this long? I know there is no time limit on emotions but does it make sense for my depression to be as a result of shoving down his death and holding onto it for all this time? I would love to hear some thoughts and opinions.

I dont know exactly what I am looking for by posting this but I have really been struggling with the emotions I have been having and would appreciate some guidance and if not, some affirmation.
