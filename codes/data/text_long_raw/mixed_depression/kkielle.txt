i’m so tired
i don’t know what i’m doing in life or where i’m going and i know i’m young and have “plenty of time to figure it out” but that doesn’t make life any less intimidating. after i graduated hs my parents told me to wait to go to college because we couldn’t afford it. understandable, we’ve always been poor, just barely making ends meet. that was two years ago. i’ve watched all my friends go away to college, move out, become functioning adults and completely forget about me. and i’m living with my parents getting maybe $20 a month in allowance. sad, i know. but i’ve applied for jobs. everyday i look for a new place to send my pathetic résumé. been doing that for a while now. no calls back. my parents are overworked and stressed and they take it out on me. i don’t blame them, if they hadn’t had me they’d be doing pretty good in life. i just want to become something, really anything at this point, i just want them to be proud of me for once and i don’t fucking know how. i’m so fucking stuck and tired. it took me 18 years to grow into the useless worthless piece of garbage i am today and i couldn’t be more over it. just want to sleep forever. 18 years was way too long for me and i’m done now
