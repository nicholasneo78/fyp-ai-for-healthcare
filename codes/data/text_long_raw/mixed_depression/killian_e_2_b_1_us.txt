I have just now realized now, after 24+ years of experiencing it, that what I've suffered from is depression. Soon after that, I spoke to my dad about it, and learned he'd been on AD's for over 10 years now, and he said he probably could have used them from the time he was about 15 years old on. He also said my paternal grandmother's side of the family was all just like us (my dad and I are almost carbon copies of each other, except he's always seemed much more "perfect" to me than I am.  ) He also said my oldest half brother is also on AD's. I also talked to my oldest daughter (who's 21 year-old), and she said she's been on AD's a few times too. I can say also that I learned many years after his death that my maternal grandfather experienced severe depression before I was born. He had shock therapy multiple times it seems...but I don't know if his problems were entirely from the extreme horrors he experienced in WWII, or a combination of that plus other problems. When I knew him he was always a sweet loving, rather quiet, man (and my favorite person in the world other than my dad.) My dad said he never associated my problems with depression (of course, neither did I), but now it all clicks. I wish I'd known all this when I was younger, that depression hadn't had the stigma it had back in the 1970s & 80s, and that I could have gotten treatment back then. Of course, if I had, I wouldn't have the same life I have now, so I guess I can't complain about that (and honestly wouldn't change a thing...I wouldn't risk losing my kids or what I've accomplished, no matter how crooked and difficult the path as been). But I will definitely watch my young kids now for signs of depression (especially my 4 year-old daughter, since she seems to have a similar personality to my dad and I). If I see it, they will get the treatment they need immediately! So in that sense I think this is a blessing...knowledge is power.
