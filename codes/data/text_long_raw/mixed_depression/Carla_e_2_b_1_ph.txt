Messed up right now...not drunk or anything. Bt I feel like my brain has abandoned me these past few days. Can't think straight...Too disoriented. What was I thinking....?! Maybe it worked out before because we never went that far...But now... Fate's dropping me far too many signs that this isn't going to work out the way I expected it to. I remember how I told Freida how I hate set-ups like that because I get attached too quickly. That it's never just... never just that. My stupid heart confuses intimacy for affection too many damned times. No, don't freak out. It's not love that I'm going crazy about. It's our friendship. And you said we weren't compromising anything. I can't believe I agreed when in truth my whole brain was flashing the word "FRIENDSHIP" in font number 40, red fill with ten thousand exclamation points. I can't lose you as a friend. It's happened too many times to me and... No, not again. Not you. We've known each other for what? 17 years? Losing you once was enough. Damn it. How stupid of me. And they say sex is the quickest way to ruin a friendship. Damn.
