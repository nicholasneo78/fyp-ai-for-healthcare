I want to open up and talk to you, but my brain tells me it will just make it worse if I do...
That's my life in a nutshell, unfortunately. 


I know I need to open up and talk through any issue that may come up but in the back of my head there's a voice telling me that if I do, it will only make it worse. And the fucked up thing about it is that the voice is right 90% of the time because most people in my life don't percieve the things that bother me as actual issues. Fuck everything about communication, it only makes things worse. I honestly don't need anything else adding to the massive weight I bear.
