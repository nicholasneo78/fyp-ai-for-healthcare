Is anyone taking Lamictal?  After trying almost every available antidepressant through the years, my psychiatrist is having me try Lamictal.  (I'm 34, started taking medications when I was 18 -- haven't really taking anything for about five years, with the exception of Zoloft back in January, which had terrible side effects.) 

Right now I'm using the starter pack of Lamictal.  I took 25 mg for two weeks, and now I'm taking 50 mg for two weeks (I'm on my 17th day) -- working my way up to 200 mg.  I don't know if I really like this medication.  It gives me headaches and affects my sleep.  I think it also increases my anxiety, but maybe that's in my head?  I suppose the side effects aren't "terrible" but I still feel somewhat drugged.

Has anyone else had success with Lamictal?  I really don't like being on medication at all and can't believe I'm going to end up taking 200 mg when right now I'm only taking 50 mg and feel as if I'm "on" something.
