Just wanted to let it out
I wanna kill myself. I'm seriously depressed and I can't bring myself to trust in others and tell them. Maybe because I can leave myself the option if no one knows to stop me if I want to go. But for now, I guess I'll keep hiding it. It's nice to be able to say it though, even if no one on here sees it.
