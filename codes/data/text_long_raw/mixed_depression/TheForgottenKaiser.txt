Does anyone else have friends that act like they like you but never text you to hang out or see how you’re doing?
I don’t have a single friend who will text me to hang out. I always have to start the conversation. Every time we hang out though people seem to enjoy my presence. I don’t get it why does no one like me, it feels like everyone is just acting nice but secretly hates me.

I try and tell my friends to hang out after a rough week and a breakup, and I just got blown off entirely. I’m really at a loss because no one gives a shit. 

Edit: For example I texted a friend of mine i’ve known since elementary school if he wanted to hang out. He said sure and he would text me later. He never did. I told literally one of my best friends I’d been having a rough week and wanted to hang out. He blew me off to hang out with someone else. I really can’t handle it.
