Does anyone else get very angry at just stupid little things?  It seems like over the last few months everyone around me is getting all they want out of life, and I am suffering with depression.  Which, of course, makes me feel worse and then I feel guilty for not being happy for them.  BUT, I also get angry when they "flaunt" their happiness around me.  My roommate just started seeing someone she met off eharmony.  We both signed up at the same time for fun, and while I was rejected time and time again, she was SO picky and then started seeing the first guy she went out with.  I am happy that she found someone and she really deserves it, but I get so ANGRY that she is constantly doing things with him.  It's like I've been replaced.  I feel like a 5 year old for thinking that, but I just can't help how I feel.  Today, for example, I asked her if she wanted to watch a movie I had gotten off our digital cable.  We have it until 9 tonight and she said she'd like to.  I was pretty excited seeing as how I hadn't been invited to a couple of events this weekend in lieu of ZACH going.  Well, she just came down stairs and said that Zach is going to be  coming over now.  This ticks me off because she broke our plans, and I don't have a way to "escape" when they are here.  I'm sure she's going to want to watch that movie with Zach, and, I know I'm being selfish, but I don't WANT him here tonight.  I haven't gotten to see Angela all weekend and the one night we have before going back to work HE is going to be here.  So I have to put on my happy face and pretend that I am glad for her and happy that she has someone and engage him in conversation when all I will feel like doing is crying.  It's unfair!  Why does it seem like when you are depressed, everyone around you has these GREAT things happening in their life.  Angela just got a promotion, a new car, and now a new boyfriend.  I am stuck in the same job, same crushing car payment, and I haven't dated anyone in over 6 years.
