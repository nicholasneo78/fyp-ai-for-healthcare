struggling to plug back in
throwaway. anyway.

i feel incredibly distant from everything. i feel like everyone is at the party, laughing and having a good time, and i'm stood outside watching. everyone just seems to be able to connect to one another. people seem to feel what i don't. i've gone through a tough part of life recently, and i feel nothing about it.

i feel like i'm too analytical and critical. everything i look at, it's fake. cheap. nothing complicated. just crap. everything just feels fake.

i went to the doctors about this. they gave me sertaline. it made me feel really shitty in the morning. and made me suicidal. they then put me citalopram. that just felt like nothing. no differences.

i never feel really happy. am i doing something wrong? am i to be like this forever? why would i continue if this were the case?
