Have you ever been told you're cold but in reality you are the opposite?
I've been told I am cold and emotionless but that's just what they see. I cry frecuently at home and feel that if someone would see me crying, I would feel completely voulnerable. Same happens with expressing how I feel. If anyone knew how I really feel, I would think they would use it against me or take advantage. Maybe they would think less of me, as someone weak and fragile.
