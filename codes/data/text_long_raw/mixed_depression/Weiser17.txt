First instinct when I wake up is to immediately try to go back to sleep to avoid the crushing anxiety and depression
Anyone else immediately try to go back to sleep as they are conscious? I'm like "no, Not this fucking shit agin" sleep is the only relief I get but that's obviously not sustainable. I really don't know what to do anymore, don't even know how I'm alive at this point.
