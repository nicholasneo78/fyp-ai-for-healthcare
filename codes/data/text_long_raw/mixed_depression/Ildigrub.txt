I ruined all four of my friendships in one stupid move
Fucking siblings. Every only child thinks they want one. Everyone with a sibling is annoyed by them, but secretly loves them. Not me. My brother makes me want to kill myself. He's one of the two reasons I'm as fucked up as I am today. And he knows that. That's why he does it. Well, one day, he was being nice to me. It was a less depressing time for me. I was bored. Thought, ya know, why not add my brother to the group chat. Big. Fucking. Mistake. He took the pettiness level through the roof and convinced my friends everything I ever do is a fucking lie. He convinced my friends I'm an asshole who does nothing but pick at him and make up problems all day. I have no friends now I feel so betrayed. Alone. I don't really care about that though. I've realized I'll never be happy. Not while he lives. Any chance I have at happiness he can rip away from me just as easily. What the fuck is the point in living??? I don't think I can do this much longer.
