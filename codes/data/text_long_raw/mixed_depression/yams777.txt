I miss my mom...
Ever since I was put into foster care, all I ever wanted was to bring my family together again. I wanted to build a future good enough to stay with my mother again.  


Instead I graduated with a shitty degree, no future, more debt than I can handle, and no real way to start improving this future. I'm 30 years old and I still cry myself to sleep thinking about my mom and all the pain she is in. I think about how much of a failure I've become and I wish I had never existed.  


She had a choice to get rid of me and choose not to thinking something good might come of this. My very existence not only ruined her life but gave myself no future or desire to live in the first place. So why am I still here? I just want it to end. I just want to see her one more time and then let it all end.
