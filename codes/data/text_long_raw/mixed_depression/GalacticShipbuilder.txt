Why does depression do this
It's destroyed my ability to properly feel love or empathy with those closest to me.


It's driving me insane and making me feel like I don't care about them anymore. But before depression I would have laughed if you'd told me I didn't care about my family. I've always been full of love and empathy. Now I'm just angry and snappy with them. I feel like a monster.
