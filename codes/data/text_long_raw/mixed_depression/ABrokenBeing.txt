Being an adult fucking blows, working a shit job that keeps me poor making me want to just jump in front of a bus
Seriously struggling to see why I would want to engage in living when it's so menial and relatively pointless.

Can't see any friends as I live so far away and my family simply don't know how to support me.


Working at a shit paying job with zero prospects and massive student debt, how can I possibly look forward to anything in the future when the present is always painful.


Mental illness is just poisoning every aspect of my world and I can't be fucked to fight it i just wish I could live more on my own terms but apparently that's selfish and naive
