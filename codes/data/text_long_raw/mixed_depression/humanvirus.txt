So tired
I lost my job in Feb. of this year. I have been on unemployment since and watching my son while i look for work. 
Well, thats about exhausted, then my water heater broke, then my only grandpa passed away suddenly. I thought i had something good going with a little media company with my long time friend, but that fell through. Now the engine in my care is locked up because of an oil leak i apparently didnt know about. If i dont find something soon it will all be up to my wife and she simply cant do it on her paycheck alone. It is all so tiring. Anytime i get a step ahead i cant help but get knocked back a dozen. I dont know what im doing anymore. I dont even know why im doing this right now. i fucking hate money.
