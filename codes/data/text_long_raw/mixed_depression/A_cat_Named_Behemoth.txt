Anxiety and Depression make you contradict and lose yourself
I've had enough. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for months and the whole situation is fucking my mind up.

I know I should face my problems but I don't want to and that amplifies my anxiety.

I just wish people ignored me and yet I feel lonely. I don't want to be hurt and yet I am the one hurting myself.

There is so many things I'd like to do but in the end I end up wasting time on the bed.

There is many things I want and yet I can't bring myself to work and get them.

If I oversleep I feel like shit, If I sleep too little I feel like shit.

I've talked about my situation with my family and they are trying to support me (I'll start therapy in September) but I can't help  feeling like a burden... 

My motto has always been "The truth is in the middle" but I've completely lost any direction and orientation. I've been costantly questioning myself and I don't even know what I want nor who I am anymore.

I apoligize if this doesn't make sense but I just needed to let it out a bit.
