My goal in life is to finally feel safe
I'm at my boyfriends house. Been here a few days. I stay here every so often to escape my unstable home life, and hes all I have.

I got a call from my dad. My childhood dog had to be putdown. Bone issues.

Everytime I think of anything that gives me anxiety I feel the need to pick at my skin. My face is red and scabbed.

I dissapoint everyone because I was the one destined to be smart and be the first (family name) with a degree and stable job.

I turn 18 next month. No job experience. I get my photo id next week. Its very late because my parents lost my birth certificate. Set me back a lot.

My mum is suddenly rushing for me to get Centrelink (welfare), so she can take half of each payment. We barely have food in the house most days because she uses her welfare on cigs and bills.

I feel like I do nothing. Everyday is just nothing. In bed, video games, browsing internet, sex, video games, sad music and alcohol. Rinse and repeat. No joy. 
I want a social life and a hobby. I want a job. I want to not feel like im just laying down while everything falls apart on top of me. 

I want to feel safe and happy and like I give back and help people. I dont want to waste my life. I dont know why but I keep feeling like I'm going to die soon. I dont want to but its in my head.

I dont want anxiety and i dont want to be pathetic and i dont want to be scared and i dont want to be bored and i dont want people hate me and i want to know what to do
