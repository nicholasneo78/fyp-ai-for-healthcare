Anyone feel like they’ve disappointed there parents?
When I was younger my parents always had high hopes and believed in me. As I got older however, I realized that I completely let my parents down. I’m a chump with a low paying job, no SO, few to little friends, and I haven’t contributed to society in a helpful way. My parents try not to show it, but I can tell I’ve failed to even come close to there expectations.
