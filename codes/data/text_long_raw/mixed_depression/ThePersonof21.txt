Do you use nostalgia to escape the present or uncertainty of the future?
I have been on a nostalgic trip for awhile and it makes me feel better, but then sad again when I come back to the present.

I have had quite an uncertain year since graduating, so maybe it is that quarter-life crisis.

Have you been through this phase?
