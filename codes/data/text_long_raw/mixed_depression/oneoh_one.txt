Had a good dream, then I woke up
Last night I had a really good dream. The type of dream that makes you think “fuck it, maybe I won’t kill myself.” I was with someone, probably an s/o, and there wasn’t anything going on but everything was at peace. Then my grandmother woke me up for a breakfast that everyone argued over, even with a goddamn three year old. Nothing changed, I just had a bullshit dream that’ll never really happen. Small rant, but the friend I normally talk to is asleep or busy.
