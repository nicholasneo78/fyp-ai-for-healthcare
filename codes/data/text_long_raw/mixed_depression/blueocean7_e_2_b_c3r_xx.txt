Whatever happened to Doctor - patient confidentiality???  I applied for short term disability because depression is affecting my job and I am barely function - able at work. The insurance company made me sign a waiver of privacy to both my therapist and psychiatrist.  Now they can call them up and ask anything they want!!

The insurance company called me yesterday for a telephone "interview"! They wanted me to explain why I needed the time off, what my symptoms are, how long have I been like this, really personal questions .......  They are going to be the ones who determine whether I can get disability pay or not! Whatever happened to just taking the word of the doctor??

I wonder who the insurance company can tell? I forgot to ask them if this is going to be kept confidential.  They also asked how this is affecting my job, I felt if I gave the "wrong" answer, they will decide not to pay me.

I wonder what they are going to ask my shrinks, and how much info the shrinks can give them.

Also, I understand that the shrinks / therapists can break the confidentiality rule if you threaten to hurt yourself or another --- that I can understand, but if you are ever on trial for something they can subpoena the doctors and they have to tell ALL!  That is ridiculous!  What happens if I am just a witness to some crime, but did not do the crime.  What happens if the lawyers want to discredit me so they put my shrink on the stand to ask what a nut I am?

Just ranting, but opinions, feedback would be appreciated.
