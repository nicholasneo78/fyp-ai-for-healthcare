Hi all, I'm Jason. I'm 29 and married. I was divorced once and have two children from a previous marriage. My wife is 5 months pregnant. I'm happy sometimes then other times i feel like dying. I'm not sure what's wrong with me but my depression keeps getting worse. I'm taking lexapro currently. I've been on paxil before. I get easily frustrated and get pissed off at everyone around me sometimes. Then I feel really bad about it .I usually beat myself up for a day or two after that. I feel like everyone wants me to do too many things at once. I just want some rest and peace. I've had lots of thoughts of suicide. The people I know bother me with the way they talk. I wish I was by myself .Only my family on an island away from all the peopleHi all, I'm Jason. I'm 29 and married. I was divorced once and have two children from a previous marriage.
