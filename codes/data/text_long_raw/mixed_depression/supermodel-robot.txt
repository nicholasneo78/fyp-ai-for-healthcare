is there a comfort in sadness?
my therapist, my psychiatrist, and my parents all say i’m “so much better” than i used to be. and i am. i know that. i don’t even think about suicide anymore and i haven’t self harmed in a few years. 

but my brain is still fucked up and it always will be. i can live with that. but not when all these people around me are telling me how happy i am. 

just because i’m better than i was a few years ago doesn’t mean i’m good. i’m better by comparison. but that’s it. and i hate being told how “great” i’m doing. 

but then i think maybe i’m just overreacting to the word “happy” because i’m more comfortable being sad. i’ve been sad for so long that there’s a certain comfort in it. sad is familiar. happy is unknown and risky. 

can anyone relate to this or am i alone?
