I wish people that have never experienced depression could still understand.
There are those who might really care about you and want to help but they have zero clue how depression works and their mindset is basically to tell you to get over it because that's what they do. It's so fucking shit. I should be grateful I have people that care about me I know, but its genuinely not that helpful when they brush aside how shit I really feel because they don't see a reason for me to feel like this other than just being weak. It's not even their fault it's just actually uncomprehendable to some people that you would rather not exist sometimes for reasons beyond your control. Why is it that any physical illness gets so much sympathy and empathy from everyone but the second it's a mental issue theres no excuse for it.
