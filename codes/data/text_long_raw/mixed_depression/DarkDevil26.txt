Eating meals alone at college has to be one of the single worst feelings one can experience at college
I feel awful right now, orientation was okay i guess, made a few acquaintances but thats it, i feel i dont really have any friends yet, i just transferred to this school, living on my own for the first time, and ive always struggled making friends, and just sitting here in the dining hall by myself just makes me want to burst into tears, maybe going away isnt and never will be for me :/, sucks how my whole life i cant seem to make friends, then finally i make 2 really good friends and i move away and im back to square one, fuck me seriously, i just cant win
