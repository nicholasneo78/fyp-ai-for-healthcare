Social media makes me want to kill myself
Constant updates, seeing everything in the world that you're not even close to a part of, seeing wealth, friends, family, your ex who has moved well on, friends who have done u wrong but seem to get an upper hand always out of an unfair situation, and laughs all around with everything just looking perfect. I've been sick of it.. since 2012. I deleted facebook and twitter in 2012 (the worst ones imo) BUTtt.. I kept instagram since then and added snapchat all so that society and my friends and people I would meet in the future would not judge me for not having any social media.. hah. It still fucking sucks. I'll never be able to escape it. I'll always see people I dislike even if I block them because a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend always pops up with them on my feed :) Absolutely hate this shit now. I was thinking back to myspace, one of the first social media sites, and it was different bc people didnt have it on their phones really.. now all social media is mobile af. You see it in groups, you see it at restaurants, you see it at work, fuck you see it everywhere. Like I mentioned, I can't escape this anymore. If I delete it all, I'm a loser lol. i'm weird, I'm this, I'm that, I'm somehow maybe creepy. shut up. This shit is a plague. No wonder I want to leave this stupid fucking earth
