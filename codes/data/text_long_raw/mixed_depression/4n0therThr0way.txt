I don't like when people ask "How are you?"
Because instead of saying: 

"I googled the prices of veterinary xanax this morning because I'm seeking any kind of relief from this inescapable malaise and self-worthlessness I've been battling for the last 14 years." 

I have remind myself that they're not actually asking how I am, and that it's just a greeting and that I have to say "Ahh, y'know, just living." so they don't worry.

I wish someone would ask how I am and actually care about the answer.
