My roommate asked me move. My car died. And I put myself in the hospital.
Girlfriend is over it and wants me to get my life together. With out without her. She doesn't want to be around me.

I'm ubering to my job at the moment. I just basically shut down at the start of sundown. Shut down and drank for 4 or 5 days with the last one with me on the phone with a rope on my neck.

I feel absolutely help less. Don't have money to pay rent. Don't have enough money to Uber to work. 

My next logical step is to move back to my mother's. Which is not only depressing. She's just 40 minutes from everything. 

I'm not even thinking suicide. I'm just thinking like life pretty much has a depressed shade over it. Probably from me recovering from withdrawal.

I don't want to move back to my mom's. To sit there away from everything I want to do. And now I gotta start over.

Fuck this is why I drank. the panick begins to consume me.
