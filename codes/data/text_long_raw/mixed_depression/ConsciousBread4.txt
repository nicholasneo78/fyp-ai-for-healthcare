Advice on dating someone with ADHD
Has anyone dated someone with ADHD? I have depression and anxiety and have been going to therapy and taking antidepressants to try to overcome it. Whenever he becomes inattentive or hyper focused on something else, it makes me feel alone and unwanted. I'm trying to be understanding of what he's going through but it's hard not having negative thoughts running through my mind.
