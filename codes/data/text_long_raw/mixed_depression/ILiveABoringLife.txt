Do you feel the same?
After seeing many of my classmates being successful in their lifes, I felt terrible… the trouble inside me just rooted even deeper. I don’t feel productive as I should be. I feel like I just want to sleep forever, not having to care about anything. I texted so many people that says to text them when I need them, but none of them replied. Maybe it is because of me who scared them away? Maybe it is because I’m an introvert who hates interacting with people? I just want someone who really cares about me, who will cheer me up when I’m sad. Right now, I’m just wondering why they have lifes that are so easy when compared to me? I have problem both physically and emotionally. I have been in the situation caused trauma and still haunt me every night. I’m jealous of them. Not having any emotional pains, can someone just tell me something that will give me hope to live on? We all probably need it.

Thanks in advance,
