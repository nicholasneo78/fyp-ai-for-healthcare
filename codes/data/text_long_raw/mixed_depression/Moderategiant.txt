Am I depressed? Or is this just my personality?
The littlest things get to me. A small criticism here, a misread facial cue there. Most likely I'm reading too much into things but idk how to change my way of thinking. I dwell on them. I can't let them go. I can sulk for weeks on what a regular person would forget in an hour. Does this sound like depression? Or has my confidence been so damaged that this is just how I percieve the world now? Because of these percieved inadequacies, my thoughts have begun to worry me. I don't want to hurt myself but I feel like I'm teetering on the precipice of having one bad enough day to push me over the edge. Therapy scares me as it puts a giant "DAMAGED" stamp on your forehead but at the same time, I can't do this on my own anymore. I'm not really looking for a fix, I just want to know I'm not alone.
