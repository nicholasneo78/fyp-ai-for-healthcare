Does anybody else go for late night walks hoping you'll walk into someone who's also feeling the same ways?
I don't know why it's never even had any romantic thoughts but it's always been a female, i always get a sense i will walk into someone going through the same things and somehow we'd know and just walk together without even talking but feel okay. Maybe its just a way to cope with feeling alone, but I haven't seen daylight in a week so whether its loneliness or a sense of something to come I'll continue. See you out there
