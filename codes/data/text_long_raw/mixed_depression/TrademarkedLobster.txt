Do you ever go to bed planning on losing the next few days?
Im about to fire up some South Park and go to sleep.  I've already planned on being useless, despondent, and out-of-touch until at least Tuesday.  I will be dead to the world.  I will not answer your calls/texts.  I will not leave my couch. I plan on hiding from everything and avoiding everyone for at least 72 hours.  I'm shutting down intentionally.  I'm making it a plan.  Fuck you, bye.
