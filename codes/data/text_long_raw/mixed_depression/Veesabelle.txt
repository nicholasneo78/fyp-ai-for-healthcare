I don't care about anything.
I have been really trying to figure how to stop feeling this way and I've seen a pattern which is just do something. Be create. Do something you like. Shit like that. I don't think people understand that I don't care about anything. I don't care. I don't like anything. I tolerate it. I don't like my favorite shows. I don't my old hobbies. I don't like the people I used to like. I don't like anything. I don't care about anything. I feel empty. Like all the things that made me who I am is gone. I don't care. How is "doing I like" helpful when I don't like anything? When I don't about anything I am doing? That is the reason I stopped doing first place. How is doing those things again going help me? This is like the biggest suggestion I have seen and I think pretty unhelpful. I can't just make myself care. I've tried. I wish I could care about those things again but I can't so suggesting to do those things, as if I wanted to stop, is like a punch to the face. "Oh your depressed? Just do what you like." No. I don't want to. I don't want things I loved and feel nothing. It hurts to want to enjoy life and can't. To want to care and you just can't. I've tried medication and therapy. I've tried giving so many fucks and I can't. I can't even fake it anymore. I wish I could. How do I care again? Do I just wait? I don't think much longer.
