I love life, but having to work and waste my life makes me suicidal.
I just dont understand, i tell people the way i feel and they say shit like "well you have the weekend at least" AT LEAST?! what the fuck. my life is being drained away one day at a time, i have all these hobbies and interests that make life worth it and i just dont get to enjoy them instead i just sit inside at a desk all day doing things i hate. 

I spoken to therapists and friends, and anyone i can. I just dont know what to do, no matter what i have to work. its just the way it is. but every single day i wake up and think why stick around, why be here doing things i hate 90% of the time just so i can complain about not getting a life for the other 10%. I just cant believe people are okay going into work everyday. its like being pecked to death by a duck. I have all these things i love, that make me happy and i just dont get to do them, and everyone acts fucking beffudeled that i feel this way. i do not get to have a life. no one does. we work for other people who are working for other people and it goes all the way up like that untill you get to the donald trumps of the world who where born with a silver spoon shoved sideways up there ass. How can people feel okay about this. ive taken drugs ive worked out everyday ive followed all the advice but it just doesnt change reality. I dont even know why im posting ill just get the same "try going back to college" bullshit, i know exactly what i want, it is simply unobtainable.
