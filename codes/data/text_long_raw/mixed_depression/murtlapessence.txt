Struggled with depression and anxiety for 3 years and made it through
Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my experiences with depression and anxiety in the hope it might give someone else a reason to keep going. I’m new to reddit, so I hope this is okay!

I’ve struggled with severe depression and anxiety for the past three years and it’s honestly been the most difficult thing I’ve ever dealt with. Mental illness is silently crippling. I’ve spent more nights than I can remember wracked with sobs, feeling incredibly alone, and fantasizing about suicide. I’ve spent more days than I can remember feeling hollow, being apathetic, and not caring about what happened to me. 

Depression is a fucking bitch, and even now, when I actually feel happy and loved and excited for my future, I’m not naive enough to think that I’ll never have to struggle with my mental health again. But I think I have learned how to best cope with it. Medication didn’t work for me, and while I do believe that professional therapy can be invaluable to people struggling with mental illness, it didn’t make a big difference in my case. But I learned to focus on the present, to rely on loved ones I’m lucky enough to have, and to forgive myself. Take it one small step at a time. So what if you couldn’t leave your room today? That shit’s fucking hard! You got up and you got out of bed, that’s the first step. Learn to love yourself even through the despair and self-loathing.

There is no one path to overcoming depression, and sometimes it’s not exactly the cure-all you envisioned but rather learning to live with it. But I promise you all that one day, it will be better. You will be happy again. And until then, I’m happy to listen to you if you ever need anyone to talk to or have any questions.
