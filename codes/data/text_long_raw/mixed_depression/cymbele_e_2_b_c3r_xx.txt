Now this stupid posting thing is screwed up - I can't do anything right

    Got the old depressed suicide bug again.

    It's funny because last night i read some articles I had written  regarding death and suicide, many about saving other depressed persons from killing themselves, recognizing the pain that the survivors go through, and not wanting it to happen to my family. And then the thought rears its ugly head, it would be so easy to let myself go, go into that peaceful night, waiting until my mom dies first (soon - natural causes) and then doing it. Because I am a failure, I can't do anything else but fail at my job. I used to write in a cave type place - a place where my writings would be secure and it's going away. That's how come I looked at my writings.

    I had told my therapist that it seems sometimes I feel angry and selfish and that's one of the triggers that trigger the thoughts of suicide. I have run out of visits covered by insurance I could pay for more but there is no need for visits - I've almost stopped talking. I feel like going home, crawling up on my bed with the teddy bear my husband hates and crying. At the cave web site, the others don't like to hear about suicide so I've stopped writing there (it's another site for depression type people - no one goes there now). I keep talking about death and suicide to my husband and my kid - and I feel guilty but the words and my thoughts are obsessed with death. I can make the decisions about my mom and my kid, but this halfway limbo concerning my states sucks. 

    I guess this is just venting. My mom has at least another week to live ....
