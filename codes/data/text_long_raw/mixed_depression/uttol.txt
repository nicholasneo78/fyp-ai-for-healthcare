I don't think who try to kill themselves actually want to die
From my experience and one of a close friend who almost died in a car accident, I think people don't really want to die. We just want the pain to go away. All the shit we take  and all the heavy baggage we have to carry, just makes us tired and lose hope

When we ponder on death, we see an easy way out, so as to get rid of the unbearable agony we suffer. 

Moreover, I watched a video of suicide survivors. About those 7% who survived suicide, claimed that in their final moments, when they were throwing themselves from a high place, they said they'd regret everything and wanted to live. Now imagine all those who died and regretted in the last moments.

Personally, I've been close to do it, but my online friends gave me so much support and so much love that I noticed that it's not worth it. I still have things I want to do. Sure getting out of bed is still a huge task. Today it took me 2 hours just to do it, but I did it. 

I'm not sure if I should have posted this in suicide or here as it has to do with both. 
Depression sucks, that's a fact we all know, but suicide is not the way to go. There is always another way, at least that is what I like to think
