How would you describe your life at this point?
I literally feel like my life is a complete crap! I’ve been holding my feelings in(self doubt, emotionally unstable) it’s been rough! I just quit my job because it was causing more panic attacks ...so now I’m without a job and still depressed! Basically life sucks for me!!!!
