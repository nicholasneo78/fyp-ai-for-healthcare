Work
I like to stay at work for long hours because it seems to be the only place where someone is glad to see me. I get to help my team members and we all laugh with each other. I almost hate to go home to someone reminding me of what I haven't done yet. At the same time, my coworkers don't really see me as a friend. I'm constantly on the outside of the conversations taking place. I'm often left behind during break and if a coworker shows or shares something with the other while I'm there,I will be ignored. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm cool enough to laugh and joke with but not cool enough for anything else.
