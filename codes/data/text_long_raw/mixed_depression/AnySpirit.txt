Maybe They are Wrong About It All
We are always told "when you are depressed, your brain is lying to you about how bad everything is". 

What if they are wrong?

If someone is piss poor and starving, can't pay their bills, replace their moth-eaten clothes or go out to do interesting things, surely their money situation really IS as bad as all that.

If someone has no family, no friends and has been bullied/abused by everyone they've met in life, perhaps their social situation really IS as bad as all that.

If someone has had lots of physical health issues like cancer, chronic pain, obesity etc, maybe their physical woes really ARE as bad as all that.

Some people go through all of the above, all at once. So maybe life IS as bad as all that for them.

The whole "your brain is lying about how bad things are" thing often just feels like "you're just imagining your problems". Like, I know depression etc make your brain incapable of dealing with them properly, but it doesn't mean legitimate problems don't exist and that some people's lives aren't thoroughly worthless all the same.
