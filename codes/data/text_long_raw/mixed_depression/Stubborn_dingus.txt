Wish I could simultaneously apologize to, and forgive, everyone I've hurt and that have hurt me
Unfortunately most of those people have cut ties. Guess I'll need to work on apologizing and forgiving myself instead.

Yikes..  :/

Wish that guilt/shame didn't effect me so much.  Much worse people are unhindered by it each day.
