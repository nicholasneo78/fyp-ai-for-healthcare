Is it possible to fake depression?
I have been feeling bad for about 7 months now.
There are periods where I cry on a daily basis, I never feel like talking, I struggle concentrating and collecting thoughts, I feel such an extreme sadness inside of me also in happy situations, I am exhausted all the time even if I sleep 10 hours straight, I often have headaches, I am completely alone and I find it difficult to do anything.
There are nights where it’s unbearable. I think about my situation: I am completely alone, I am failing at anything because I am so weak I can’t handle my feelings, I feel guilt for everything that happens around me, I can’t carry on anymore, I am always here in this dark place and I feel that I have no right to be like this. I used to self harm and I still have many scars on my skin, but I think to be disrespectful to those who truly struggle then I promised to cut never again. I shouldn’t have the right to do so.
My life is void, I am void, and I can’t get the energy to do anything ever. I do not get pleasure from what I used to love, nothing seems to make me feel something good. I can enjoy no series, no book, no videogame like I used to.
I think I don’t even deserve to eat.
I am just trying to pity myself giving myself depression, but I don’t have it.
Is it possible to fake depression?
Could it actually be an excuse for me to not take responsibility of the failure that I am?
