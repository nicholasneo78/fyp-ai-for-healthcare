I wish I was 15 again, when nothing really mattered
I'm 21 now and all I want is to be 15 again, when I didn't have any worries,  when I didn't know what depression was, when I had interests, when I didn't have existential crisis, when I didn't question every little thing about myself, I was just able to BE. Not to say everything was perfect back then, but every year it starts feeling emptier and emptier. Even though my life has technically better, I feel so empty and dead.
 I don't even want to know what my brain will be like in 10 years. Even though realistically my life is better off now. I still want to die. My god, I just want to die
