Did your mental health get worse post secondary?
So I’m in grade 12 right now and I’ll probably be moving out and onto a uni campus (if they accept me hopefully) and I’m honestly pretty nervous. I’ve been clean for a little over a year now and I’m terrified I’ll relapse and without my parents and dog with me it’ll be even tougher. 
So yeah how do you guys cope with a whole new environment and being away from home? (Also any advice on uni in general would be helpful)
