Am I Depressed?
While I've been distraught and suicidal on and off since age fifteen, I've never been formally diagnosed with anything because I don't trust the mental-health establishment. I've only visited a shrink twice: once when forced by parents, a second time when pressured by a partner.

Because of this, I'm reluctant to claim I'm depressed except in the loose, colloquial sense. Instead, I feel my rage and despair flow quite appropriately from my failure to fulfill my desires, achieve my dreams, and so on. I hate being alive and would adore a sudden death, sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm depressed, right?

I don't experience many of the symptoms of formal depression: I sleep pretty well most of the time, I eat okay, and I'm socially active. (I feel abjectly isolated, but empirically I spend a fair amount of time with friendly acquaintances at events and so on.)

I resist the medical model of my mental state because it assumes the problem's with me rather than with the world. I figure I'd be okay if I had the basic level of social success normal folks have: a number of close friends and a healthy romantic/sexual relationship with one or more partners.

I'm becoming increasingly confident my genetics and values combine to make forming meaningful connections with other humans effectively impossible. Because I yearn for such connections intensely, it's only rational that this dynamic would make my life unlivable.

I'm not depressed. My brain ain't malfunctioning; it's as valid a pattern as any. The uncaring universe approves of my mind as much as anyone's. I'm just not biologically equipped to thrive in the environments I find myself in.
