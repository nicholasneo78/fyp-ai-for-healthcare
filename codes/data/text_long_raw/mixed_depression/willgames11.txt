Whats the point anymore with love
After nearly a year of struggling to stay happy from what happened between my ex and I and trying not to do relationships anymore, i let myself slip and gave myself a chance with this one girl who is amazing and nice and kind and such just to be thrown away after one fucken week. We work together and she liked me alot but since im a manager and shes an employee, we had to keep it a secret but people were already starting to spread rumors about us and my GM who wasntnearly as suspicious about it cut her hours and days for this week and i asked why. His response was that she was flirting with alot of other guys and it was becoming a problem so he cut her days to just 1 this week. When she saw the schedule she thought about us and how it was a bad idea to date and it wouldnt be a good idea anymore since she doesnt want to lose her job. Exactly one week of dating and I already lost someone that i didnt want to go away just like that. Like yeah im a bit sad but not enough to cry or anything but it just like, i was so fucken happy again i started to smile, something i havent done in months and it just felt nice but now im back to my depressed state of being lonely as usual and just play games, work and goto sleep and repeat that day after day until i end it all. This is why i try my best not to date or get attached to anyone because if i try to date, it will just end badly for me. I just want to be happy and have someone close.
