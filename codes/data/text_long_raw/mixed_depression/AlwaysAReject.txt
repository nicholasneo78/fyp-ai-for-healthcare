I'm not dead. I'm trying my best now to get a full recovery
First off sorry to anyone in this sub who messaged me or was worried about what I posted before. I haven't even come on here besides to see the front page. I didn't hang myself although I was really close too. It would've been my third attempt and even though shit sucks right now I'm trying my best not to. Thank you for whoever attempted to talk me out of it, I read them all. Here's to all of us getting better and living our lives to the fullest
