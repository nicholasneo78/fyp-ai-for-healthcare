Fuck you for being happy around me
Goddamn it, I can't even think straight. I hate the people who make me happy because they choose not to. I'm completely alone, and the worst thimg was thinking for a day or two that wouldn't last forever.

Except I don't think that, I know that its bot like I have a bad fate, I'm not destined to never have any friends and feel this way my whole life. Its stupid to say that I am.

Except I am.
