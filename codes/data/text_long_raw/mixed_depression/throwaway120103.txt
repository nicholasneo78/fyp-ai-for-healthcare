It's hard to keep standing up, keep fighting, and get down each time. I just want it to end
I’m done. Hard work doesn’t pay off. Ever since I was 14 I felt depressed and like I’m not good enough. I felt like it was my own fault that I felt so sad and angry and that I wasn’t good enough for other people. One day I decided that if it we’re my own fault I felt that way then I could also improve my situation. Al my negative emotions went into working hard. 

I finished my studies (not by working hard, but because I was good at it) and put all negative emotions into working out. I got accepted into a difficult job at the Army. Now I quit the Army because of an injury in my knees. At the same time I lost a girl, even though we only went on one date, I thought she could be the one positive thing to take from the Army and all the hard work I put in to get into the Army. 

So what’s my situation now? Jobless, girls still despise me, have a degree with which I can’t find a job with and all the work I put into improving my situation was for nothing. 

While trying to improvie myself and during my studies and time at the Army I still had periods where I felt very down. It just becomes harder and harder and harder to crawl out of it every time. The negative voices and feelings are too much and getting up to fight just becomes impossible.

I had the power once to get up and try to fight. Now I don’t even have the power to suicide. But I just wish it was all over. 

Eventhough it feels useless I might go to a psychologist. How has it helped you guys? I wan’t to end it all but I don’t want to end it all. I don’t know. I feel lost and sinking deeper every damn time.
