My mom mocks my depression to her friends
My mom doesn’t believe I’m depressed even though all the psychologists I’ve been to so far tell her I am - and i KNOW myself that feeling like I want to kill myself all the time isn’t a healthy mindset. I’ve tried to off myself a few times to no avail (without her knowing) and narrowly escaped inpatient.
She calls me lazy and ungrateful, complains about how I don’t do anything productive and sit around all day, I don’t eat much if anything. She treats me so awfully and if I retaliate in the same way all of a sudden I’m the bad person.
And here’s the worst of it: I heard her talking about me to her friend, laughing and mocking me, saying stuff like ‘oh everything is always wrong for her, poor girl! she says shes depressed but i know she’s making it up for attention so she doesnt have to do work around the house like the lazy bitch she is’
It crushes me even further and at this point I don’t know what to do. I want to kill myself but I have so many goals and aspirations for the future. I’m stuck in this position between so badly wanting to live and so badly wanting to die.
