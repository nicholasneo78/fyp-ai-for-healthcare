I find it very hard to make decisions. I know there's a little bit of anxiety behind every decision, but it's starting to control my life. I'm trying to find a new job and a new home. I'm also always thinking about a breakup with my girlfriend of 4.5 years. I know these are big things in my life, which lately has been causing a tremendous amount of anxiety/depression/panic. I'm 32 and I don't think I was raised with the correct tools for dealing with life sometimes. For others it seams so much easier. I'm depressed at my current job/home. I need to change. I'm afraid of change. It's a vicious cycle. Can anyone relate? What works for others?
