I'm a 33 year old man with a history of depression (I was diagnosed when I was 10) and of "standing apart" -- not refusing to fit in out of some sense of rebellion, but not fitting in simply because I couldn't. I have never been married. I've had only one long term relationship -- it was long - distance and very turbulent for both my partner and I (the relationship ended three years ago). To this day I wonder why I don't "measure up", why I can't seem to find my place in life. While not physically stunning by any means, I never thought I was hideous, either -- though my looks have most often been pointed out to me as a shortcoming, so that's the explanation I tend to go with most of the time. When I hit my teenage years, panic disorder became a problem, too (as I realized how little control I had over my life and the way it was going to turn out).
At the beginning of each year, I stand back and take stock of my situation, asking myself: where am I right now? Which direction am I headed in from here? What are my options? Up until now, I could always find some reason to be at least a little hopeful, to keep going -- but this year I can't. I've been out of work for a long time, the panic attacks are getting bad again, I've had a number of relatively minor but still worrisome health problems in the last few months -- and worst of all, after so many years, I'm still alone. There are no prospects out there; no one wants to be with me.
I'm in a lot of pain and I don't know how to make it better. This is not just a temporary slump, it's my whole life, but it hurts even worse now than it used to.
