I have really been trying to 'control' my rage while driving. Since being medicated it's not as bad, but I can't stop. Today this guy chased me, forced me to pull over and started yelling, I thought he would hit me. I was surprisingly calm, not even afraid. I guess I just didn't care what happened to me at that point I hate when I get so angry, go into road rage mode, because I feel like crap afterwards, I don't like myself, I usually cry. I can't talk to my husband especially about this. I feel very isolated. All he does is get mad, lecture me, tell me to stop, don't you know it's dangerous, etc. He judges and blames me. He has no idea how I feel and I doubt he ever will. I feel better now that I can come here and talk to people who will understand my feelings (even if what I did is wrong, I hope???). It's very easy to say you'll change, you'll calm down. Easier said than done. I feel like I have to hide the fact that I'm in this forum from my husband, I have to hide a lot from him. I just hope that raving lunatic doesn't come after me if he finds out where I live. I have talked to my therapist about this but not in any depth, I only get 45 minutes of her time per session. I'd need hours. Thanks for listening, I feel a little better
