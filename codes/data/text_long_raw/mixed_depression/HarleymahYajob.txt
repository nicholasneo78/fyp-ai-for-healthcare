I think about multiple ways of killing myself everyday but I can't bring myself to do it.
I'm so done feeling so so alone. I have friends who I can talk to, but I feel like I'm burdening them everytime. I'm pretty much done with my life. my studies are going nowhere, and I have no motivation in life.

I thought of running into the road, but I wouldn't want to be that selfish and traumatise some innocent driver. I thought of throwing myself off the building, but I wouldn't want my family to be burdened with that gruesome image.
