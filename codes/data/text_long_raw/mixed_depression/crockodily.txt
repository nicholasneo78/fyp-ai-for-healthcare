I'm so tired.
So tired of everything.

I lost mostly everything I've cared about in such a short timeframe. My father went from cancer diagnosis to dead in a 3 month time span.

 My friends don't deserve to deal with me so I've isolated myself. They just enjoy shitposting and memeing, not a pathetic emo child who is literally incapable of being happy right now.

One of my closest friends and unfortunately now ex-gf, not only do I still hate myself for how I was but I can't even bring myself to talk to her, I'm just a pathetic waste of a human.

All notifications on everything have been off for nearly a week, I don't get on discord anymore. I just feel so alone, so helpless, so very tired both physically and mentally.

Even something as simple as having to raid on WoW, my anxiety is horrible with dealing currently and I constantly stress out about people finding out that I'm unhappy because I don't want anyone to see me like this. It's pathetic. It's the only 'social' thing I do anymore and I don't even want to do that. Playing a videogame is too stressful. P a t h e t i c.

There is no fixing me I've come to realize, I just accept what is going to happen to me since I know I don't deserve to be happy.

Just needed to get some thoughts out, I've gotten about 2 hours of sleep in the last 3 days and it's not for the lack of trying. I just wish I knew how to fix myself when I was still fixable.
