I'm afraid to be alone.
People are a distraction but once they're all gone I can't help but get anxious of the idea that I am here in my room by myself with my thoughts and there is no one out there that I want to give me some closure. There is no one out there that I want because the conversations with them feel so meaningless and unhelpful. I feel aware of my mind and feel like this whole world is a distraction of some dark shit that's happening behind it all and it freaks me out and I don't know what do, I'm afraid.
