Okay, here's the deal. I'm 17, and I have been depressed and suicidal for as long as i can remember. (See the post "God Hates Me") I just want to die. I hate living. It feels like no one cares. In order to combat my depression I write. To date I have written four major writings (50,000- 200  pages -  words or more) and am on my fifth. Last year, when I was on my first major writing one of my friends asked me if she could read it. I was hesitant because it's my soul. I take everything I feel and put it down on the page. It's all I do. i don't go out or have any kind of social life. Writing is my life.

But, I eventually let her read it. She liked it and read that whole writing. Since then she has become my editor of sorts. There's just one problem - she's not editing.

You see, she's a drama geek - in plays and everything - and doesn't have a whole lot of free time so I understand a slow pace, but lately I've had to prod her to do anything. Even over Christmas break she didn't do anything. Now, I have to call her on the weekends (which is the only time she'll even do it now) to get her to do anything. If I don't she'll forget she even has it. Every time I ask her about it, she just tells me how busy she is and I end up feeling guilty. I feel like she's rejecting me as a person, like she's saying "i just don't care about you." It hurts me so bad. It makes me feel like the one thing keeping me alive is stupid. It makes me want to kill myself. I feel like it's a burden to her. It hurts me so bad. It makes me go home and cut myself.
I have no idea how to handle the situation. I want her to do it, but I don't want it to seem like i'm pestering her. I understand she's busy, but she makes time to go out with her other friends. Couldn't she make a little time for me?

Am I being unreasonable here? What should I do? Please help.
