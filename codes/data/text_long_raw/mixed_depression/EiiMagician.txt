I hate myself so much
I’m self centred, I’m selfish, I’m weak, I’m annoying, I’m an idiot and I can’t do anything right. I can’t tell how people manage to put up with me. I’m so fucking useless. I’m getting tired of bashing myself up like this. Do I deserve it? Yes, I do. It’s so hard trying not to hurt myself in the worst way possible. I’m unloveable. I miss being happy with the way I am. Why does god hate me so much? It’s tiring.
