Why am I an idiot?
I always feel the need to be loved by someone else. So I am constantly trying to talk to a girl and get a date. I actually went on a date recently. A couple weeks ago I hit it off with this girl from another school nearby and we had a lot in common. We vibed really well and seemed to have similar feelings for each other. We talked for a couple of weeks and then we went on a date. I think we both enjoyed ourselves but we didn’t talk as often afterwards. I blame myself for that because I feel like I should have been more social with her. We don’t talk anymore and I wish I still talked to her but it has been a weird amount of time since our date and I don’t know how to go about it. When I finally get a chance to have a girlfriend like I feel I need, I fuck it up. Does anybody have any idea of what I can do with this situation?
