Why is it so hard to just be empathetic?
Today, I failed miserably at baking a key lime pie. Filling was way too loose, meringue wouldn't whip, crust cracked, just a terrible time overall. And then my mom comes over and instead of comforting me or something a normal human being would do, says "Better luck next time," with the tone of a carny trying to get a six year old away from his ring toss booth. I got even more upset, and that seemed to genuinely confuse her.

All I wanted in that moment was for her to say "I'm sorry your pie didn't turn out, it'll be okay." Or just something a human being with emotions would say to their upset daughter.

This even just kind of exemplified what I get sick of in people. Even if you don't "get it" why is it so hard to realize that people have different priorities from you? Especially people who are depressed or have other mental illnesses. It can be a triumph for us to get out of bed some days. If we share an achievement or (more rarely) a failure with you, be with us in that emotion for a moment. Why is that so hard for "normal" people?

Oh yeah. Because all the empathetic people are depressed.
