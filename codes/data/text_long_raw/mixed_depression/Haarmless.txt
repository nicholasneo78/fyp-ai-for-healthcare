Do you ever feel you're not cut out for society?
I recently got a job working graveyard shift at a grocery store, it's not "hard" work per say it's just tedious as fuck. Shifts are 8hrs long and I'm making minimum wage. Most people would like to have my job it's relatively simple and easy but I feel like shit every time I come home from a shift.

Society "requires" us as citizens to go to work pretty much every day to pay for living expenses and food. It's a fucking bitch and I don't feel like I'm cut out for it, It's fucking hard for me and I have absolutely no motivation to go to work everyday just to survive

Sorry for the rant haven't taken my antidepressants today yet.
