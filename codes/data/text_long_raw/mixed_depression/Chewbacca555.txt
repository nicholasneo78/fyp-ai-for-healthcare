Music has a huge effect on my moods
Music has a huge effect on my moods. I have been having an okay day with a good amount of anxiety and my depression hasn't been so strong. The depression is not of course gone. It's just not as bad today. I was listening to this song that I like which is ironic but it's a pretty sad song. It triggered me and made me really sad and made my depression worse. I was thinking of my abuse, my relationship with my girlfriend and other things during it. I was thinking of a lot of things and then my mood flipped. 

Is anyone okay messaging me to talk? I can support you too if you want.
