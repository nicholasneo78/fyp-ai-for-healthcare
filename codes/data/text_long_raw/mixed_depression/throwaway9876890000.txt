Feeling drugged and crushing anxiety
This post is not unlike the others in this sub. Today im struggling, ive been struggling for years but today its worse. The depression is so bad that i feel drugged. My head feels too heavy for my neck to carry. My anxiety is crushing my chest. How much longer will this continue? Where do i get the energy to keep going?
