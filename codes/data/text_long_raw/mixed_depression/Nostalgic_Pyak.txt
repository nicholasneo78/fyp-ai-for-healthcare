Something i wrote during one of crying fits
Bridges were burned

Yet my heart it still yearns

Lessons were learned

Inside I still burn 

Not a flame of love, nor an ember of passion

A blue flame lit, reminiscent of what I'm lacking

A lonely lit candle that pains my insides

Those tears of mine dried up, no longer can I cry

New year, I'm out of luck, anxious and somber here I lie

I scratch and I scratch, yet numbness blocks out the feeling

There's no way to patch up, I'm broken glass I'm far from healing

Empty conversations with people I could not care less about

I envy healthy relationships, ones that I could not have, no doubt

Eyeballs that cannot weep and screams without sounds

I'm still depressed when people are around

Yet I'm hard to read, I'm one to bleed

Waste time as I scroll through my social feeds

Waste hours as thoughts take over and I can't sleep

I cannot compete

Yet I cannot accept

Looping like a gif in my head

The words you said

Up until now

And from the day that we met.

If you read this thanks for reading.
