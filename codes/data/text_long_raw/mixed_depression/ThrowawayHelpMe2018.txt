[Need Advice] Need anti depressants but I don't want my mum to know about it.
Hello guys, I am 17 and I live in Singapore with my Mum. I have been depressed on and off for the past 5 years with serious suicidal thoughts for the last 4. 

I really think that it's time that I start anti depressants because I reckon it would help me tons. The problem is, I don't want my mum to know because the last time I opened up about being slightly suicidal and very depressed, she freaked out on me (don't need to get into details.) She has had a history with it herself and I know that if i ever took my life, it would permanently ruin her. 

At this point, medication is my last resort. I've had a girlfriend and it made no difference whatsoever, I still feel empty most of the time and would rather die than anything else.

I know that in Singapore you're able to consent medically when you're 16, but I'm not sure if i can possible get around her for meds like this without her knowledge/consent. Any help for my situation would be fantastic :) Thanks everyone
