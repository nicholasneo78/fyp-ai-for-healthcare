Exercise will make you feel better!
Is what everyone says. So I listened and signed up for a gym membership. Fast forward one year later, I've become *so* obsessed with the image of my body and being as thin as possible, I overexercised and underate, so on top of my depression, I messed up my health and I developed an eating disorder which is making me far more depressed. It wasn't supposed to be this way. 

I think I'm about to lose my mind.
