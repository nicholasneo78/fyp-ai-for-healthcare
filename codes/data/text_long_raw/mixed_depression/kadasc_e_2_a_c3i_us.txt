I am 17 and am going through some really hard times. My close friend died in a car accident last may, I am going through relationship problems, my body isn't fighting disease off very well, I am looking for where i belong in life / school, I was sexually abused by my boss and have a trial coming up the first of march, I have classes like physics and calculus to look forward to, my father and i haven't gotten along very well which is really hard because we were very close, my mother is pushing me very hard especially since i have interests in becoming a doctor, my job barely pays for my gas, my school told me i would be able to attend a seminar in Wisconsin and recently told me somebody else got to go instead, my friends are few and of lately not very true, and sadly that is the start of it ... i was hoping that i would be able to find somebody that could lend an ear since i have trouble finding anybody that cares much here.  i need a friend ...
