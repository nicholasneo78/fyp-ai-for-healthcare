Self-care tips?
Hi Reddit,

So where I am at today is the episode I've been in is decreasing in severity.  I've been having some success with (through?) adding some structure to my day-to-day.  Using checklists and schedules and other work tools seem to be helping with the mental health work I have to do.  What are some daily/weekly/monthly 'tasks' you find help your health?
