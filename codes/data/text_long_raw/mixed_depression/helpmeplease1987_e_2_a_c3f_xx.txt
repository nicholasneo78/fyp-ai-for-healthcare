Do good guys actually exist, because i'm beginning to lose faith. Every guy i have taken an interest in has been bad for me. I'm only 18, but i have slept with 7 people, which i think is a lot and makes me a slag. I started dating at the age of 10, and was with that guy until 15.  I've done the whole dating thing now, i just want someone to take care of me and try to understand me. I've only ever been a sex toy to men ... and i hate it. Not one guy has actually wanted me ... they just wanted sex.

Everyone keeps telling me that i need to have fun, go out, get laid. But that isn't my style ... i want someone to hold me tight and tell me everything will be okay ... but i fear good guys don't actually exist for people like me.
