Just feeling very isolated right now.
It's one of those situations where all I want is for someone to realize I'm drowning. All I want is to be offered a hand up... To feel like I actually matter to someone. I recently lost what I would consider to be my last friend IRL and haven't been out of the house for any reason other than work in weeks. 
The person I call a best friend is a person I've known less than six months who lives half way across the country. I've been waiting around hours hoping he will ask me for a phone call. He hasn't. And I don't want to continually pester him since he hasn't offered me a phone call tonight.
I don't really know why I'm posting in this group. I guess so maybe I can imagine that someone somewhere will read my current thoughts and maybe I won't feel quite so alone.
Thanks for reading if you made it this far.
