Lately i have been having some very vivid story - like dreams, normally i can't follow my dreams because they switch too quickly. i had a dream where i took my grandmother's large knife and a permanent marker and wrote my signature on it. Then later my mother found out about what i had done and became so angry with what i had done, that she made me cry, and i actually woke up crying. Then later that day i took a nap and i dreamt that i was being seduced by Tom Cruise, (who had gained a lot of weight), and when things began to heat up i rejected him, and he became very angry at me. He then later came to the house where i was, and began trying to hurt me and the people around me (which was an older lady, a young boy and teenage girl). i could hear him saying "just kill them" and talking about how he was really embarrassed when i rejected him, and he could do so much better than me. i then proceeded to take the young boy into hiding, and while hiding we were found and the boy hurt Tom defensively, but in a very graphic manor. I can't understand why i'm having such negative dreams, why they are so vivid, and what they all mean!
