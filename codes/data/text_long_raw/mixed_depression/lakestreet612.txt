Pristiq (desvenlafaxine er succinate 25 mg) question
So a few days ago my doctor wanted me to try this cause I’ve been having a hard tine in life lately due to several negative things happening pretty much all at once. So I’ve become a little depressed. 

Anyways, does or has anyone taken Pristiq?.... and what are your thoughts, concerns, recommendations, etc.....?


If this matters....

I also take daily:  Adderall 15mg XR, Percocet 40mg, 2700mg Gabapentin and naproxen 500mg. 

When needed I take: baclofen 10-20mg, Xanax up to 2mg, Flexeril 10mg and Zanaflex 4mg.
