Just wanted to share
Hey, first time posting here. Just wanted to talk to someone there since is not really any option irl.

I just kind of threw away all the good prospects in my life over the course of a week and have been feeling like a piece of crap. Probably not news to anyone here, that's how it usually goes. But tonight I feel okay. I recently decided just to drop everything and run away (not the first time I've done it, I've gotten good at it actually) and have been just sitting while I wait for finances to become ready.

This is a record low point in my life, but tonight I changed how I feel about it by just getting some chores done, getting drunk, and treating myself the way I wish other people would treat me. I'm talking booze and watching horrible telivision from the 80's 

And it dawns on me that I'll get another chance. I may have fucked things up this time but I've bounced back from fuckups before by just acting natural so I'm probably going to do so again. There will be more chances to treat people the way I want to be treated no matter what age I get to. I don't need someone to be nice to me, all I have ever needed in life is just to be nice to other people.

It's a silly sentiment but it's all I got right now, I hope it reaches someone else who can benefit from hearing it. If you pray, pray for me in the next three months because it's  all I got. Ask me for some nice nice words and I'll give some to you as personally as I can. Things get better when you're kind to others. No matter what the haters might tell you.
