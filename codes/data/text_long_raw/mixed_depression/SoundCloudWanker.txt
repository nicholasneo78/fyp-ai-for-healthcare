i miss my old self
i remember how easy life was when i was a youth. clubbing, would hang out with mates, went to the gym, had myself a beautiful bird, played football for my school, and made my parents proud. today? im a pathetic sack of shit who does nothing but study for uni all day and I've lost so many mates cause of it. although now that I think abt it, i don't just study all day. in addition, I've also wasted/am wasting two years of my life on this fucking website winding up people on alts on the football forums here and I fucking regret every last second of it.
