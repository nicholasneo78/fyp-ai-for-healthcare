Hi My name is Tracy, I am 44 years old and have three children 4,8 and 11, I've been going through something lately I wake up in the morning and its like I'm in a different world. I cry about everything. I look at pictures of my kids when they were younger and I burst into tears. I have nothing to be depressed about , good wife, good kids ,good job, I don't understand what's going on. This is totally out of my character. Now it's getting to the point to where I don't want to go to work on night shifts because I'm afraid something will happen to them while I'm at work. Also when I have to sleep during the day I have trouble falling to sleep Its like I'm scared to sleep. I have also wake up from a deep sleep with panic attacks, I have learned how to talk myself out of them. Everything is so emotional it's like I'm morning the death of one of my children. Any way its driving me and my wife crazy, Its not all the time it comes and goes, other times I am fine. My wife says I'm so much more loving toward my family when I'm going through this. I am on zoloft per family doctor. But it don't seem to help. I also have sleep apnea which I read can cause depression. Well if anybody Knows what I'm going through please respond, I don't know if its depression or some kind of sleep problem. Thanks for listening
