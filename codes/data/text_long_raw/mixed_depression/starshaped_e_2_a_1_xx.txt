I really don't know what to do. I've suffered with depression for the past 6 years. It comes and goes with treatment. I thought i was over stuff but over the last little while it has got really bad again. I feel so low, so low and i can't pick myself up. I'm drifting away from everyone, they all enjoy going to the pub etc and i hate being with loads of people and i don't drink so i don't go out. They have given up on me now. I hate my job. That brings me down so much. I work for the ambulance service taking 99 calls and i can't deal with the pain and suffering of everyone anymore. A 15 year old girl died the other day whilst i was on the phone and it's just not fair. I just can't deal with stuff anymore. I feel alone, i am dull and boring, in debt and i just cant see the point anymore. The only thing keeping me afloat, and i really feel like I'm hanging on by the skin of my teeth is my boyfriend he is the only thing i live for and he is bound to dump me. It's like a vicious circle. I'm incredibly insecure and he will get fed of it and dump me. If he dumps me that will be it there will be nothing. I think about it all the time. I want time off so i can just be on my own but I'm screwing up my chance of finding another job so i can get away from this one. I don't know what to do. I am seriously thinking about ending it all and i don't know how to pick myself up.
