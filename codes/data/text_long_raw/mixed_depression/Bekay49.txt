Why doesn't the military care
I've been in for almost 3 years now and for the past 2 years I have not been my self. I can't sleep at night, I find no joy and anything at all anymore I literally hate the world all because of the navy. I've asked for help a year or so back and when I got the chance to talk to a chaplin and explain how I just hate the navy and what's it's done for me all he told me was that it's good I'm in and I need to suck it up and move on. 

Now I'm at a new command. Ones that's actually very strict and now with problems like this there's actually bad repercussions for depression and shit so I asked someone I knew from my last command on what to do and he got a hold of someone here and shit blew up. I had chaplins calling me and a bunch of higher ups and I denied the chaplins talk because of my problems with the last one and I just went with a first class instead. Once again all they told me was how great the navy is and how my problems are just me being a pussy pretty much. Why doesn't any care about how we feel or how I feel. My last command we had a person who shot them self and they just swept it under the rug and acted like it never happened. Who can I actually talk to here that can help. All i want is to get out of the shit and be fucking normal again.
