Looking for an opinion
So I have been angry for awhile now, and I feel like my anger is unjustified. A few weeks, I told one of my close friends that I had feelings for her, and I also told her I wanted some space to get over these feelings. This is because I couldn't be with her. She has a significant other. 

Soon after, she wouldn't talk to me at all, and she avoided me. All of her friends told me that I shouldn't have done that because it was a bad thing to do. I just wanted to tell her that I wanted some space from her, so I could no longer have feelings for her. Since then, all of her friends, have treated me with aggression and insults. I get dismissed every time I'm around her and all of her friends. This has launched me into another Depressive episode. 

I was yelled at by other people and ostracized. 

I was thinking that what I did wasn't so bad, but maybe I'm wrong. I feel like a bad person. I know this probably ridiculous, but I've also feel like killing myself because being ostracized and dismissed is one of my fears. I have social phobia.
