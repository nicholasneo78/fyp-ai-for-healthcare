first therapy
I just had my first ever therapy today and im not really shure if i liked it or not. I tried to be really open and talked about everything but she kinda just went over the fact that i mentioned that i sometimes have suicidle thoughts(which is like the only reason i made myselve go in the first place). Dunno why i write this here, maybe i just wanted to tell someone.
