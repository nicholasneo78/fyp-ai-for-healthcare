anyone who can offer me advice on this it would be amazing!
my girlfriend is the greatest girl I've ever met, i love her and want to marry her eventually. Here's my problem though: she's still in high school. and ever since i moved away to university i have been constantly constantly worrying about things i can't control. like when she drinks with her friends, and whether or not I'll still love her in a month, whether or not she's going to suddenly ask herself "what am i doing in a long distance relationship anyway?". these are all ridiculous things to worry about. not only because she loves me to the ends of the earth, but because i have ZERO control over them. these worries are driving me insane and slowly ripping up our relationship. does anyone have any advice to offer?
