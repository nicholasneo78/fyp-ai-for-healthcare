My Story - There is hope.
**TRIGGER WARNING - includes graphic language.**

Hi there, first time posting. I see a lot of posts from high school/college aged people, and being through that myself, all I want to do is reach out and hug them and tell them how special they are. Instead of writing all the typical stuff "you're so young," "you'll grow out of it," "go see a therapist/take medication," etc., I thought I'd share how depression affected me mentally &amp; emotionally and my journey through college. I got to the point where depression was life threatening, and I had given up all hope. I was lucky because my mom (and my dad) were 100% committed to my recovery, even if it meant I deeply hated and resented them at the time. I realize not everyone has that, but in sharing my story, I hope that maybe certain aspects can resonate with people going through the same thing I did and help them not feel so alone.

**How Depression Affected Me**\- trigger warning

It finds a way to connect to memories. To healthy feelings. And twist them into something dark. It craves uncertainty and pain and tells you that you deserve only that. It makes you seek out the deepest crevices of your mind and get lost. To the point where you don’t even know what’s you and what’s the sickness anymore. It almost feels good to indulge because it’s so familiar. We’re taught that enduring pain is somehow one of the most beautiful things a person can do. But what if that pain isn’t real?

In college, I was so afraid of being alone that I wouldn't want guys to leave my room. And there were a fair amount of them. I'd beg them to stay longer and tell them I had separation anxiety. As long as I was focusing on them, I didn't have to focus on me. I justified it by saying that I was 'enjoying' my college experience and 'exploring' my sexuality. 

I thought it was normal to not see color, to not ever be excited, to want to drink until my body was as numb as my mind. I wondered how other people could live life with relative stability and thought I was weak for not knowing what they knew. To me, it seemed like common knowledge that life was pointless and ultimately a waste of time. I didn't understand why I was the only one that couldn't cope with that fact. When I was home over a break, I told my mom that I had accepted I would never be happy. When my mom said she was hurt by that, it didn't even occur to me why. I thought I had learned the secret that everyone else knew, the secret that let them go to class or work or see friends or make friends.

Even though by the end of my freshman year, I was cutting myself and promiscuous and drank with the purpose of blacking out so I could have even just an hour of relief from myself, I couldn't admit that I had depression. I thought I felt and acted like that because I was lazy, stupid, slutty, weak. Every semester, my grades slipped a little (or a lot) at a time, and my parents grew more and more disappointed in me. I had been a star student in elementary school, frequently getting the highest scores in class and got into every top middle &amp; high school. I felt like such a failure. At this point, my parents sent me to a very expensive therapist, which ultimately was a waste of money because all I did was bend the truth to hide every aspect of myself and life. I don't think I could have even been honest even if I wanted to at this point.

The first semester of my junior year, these thoughts grew too heavy. I didn't want to be there anymore. I wanted to be nowhere, not awake, not asleep, not alive, not dead. I spent my time with people that encouraged all my doubts, and I pushed away people that cared. I rarely went to class and even if I did, I scraped by on the assignments. I lived for the moments of escape when I could go to parties and drink and hook up with guys, no matter how repelled I was by them. Outside of those few hours of escape, I couldn't sleep. I never went to the cafeteria with friends or even to get a real meal. I only ate Lean Cuisines that my parents had bought me at the beginning of the year. When I ran out, I ate solely Pizza Rolls and peanut M&amp;Ms. I didn't do laundry once in those few months and barely took showers. The only time I put any effort into my personal appearance was when I went to a party because all I wanted was to be perceived as "carefree" and "sexy," not the lazy slob that I thought I was. Even then, I wore wildly inappropriate clothing compared to what everyone else at my college wore - one time a girl yelled out to me, "You're going to get raped!" Another said judgmentally to a friend, "She's not wearing pants." (I was wearing sequined booty shorts, okay). My only happy moments that semester were with a boy that then tried to sexually assault me with a visiting alumnus. His excuse was that he wanted to get into the alumnus' frat by impressing that brother. When he tried to apologize the next morning, I told him he shouldn't apologize. I was so disconnected from my body, I didn't even view it as mine anymore. After that, I didn't blame him and still spent most of my 'free' time with him. (Free meaning when I wasn't laying on my bed trying to gather enough strength to even leave my room, going to a party or the rare occasion I went to class or very very rarely attended a sorority event.)

My last night at that school, my theory that I had borderline personality disorder was weighing on me. I had been thinking about it for a couple of weeks after I had finally figured out that my behavior and thoughts were not the typical college experience, thanks to my extremely honest roommate &amp; sorority sister. She told me that other girls in the sorority thought I was trying to "fuck with their guy friends" and slept with too many people. I tried to go to the student health center earlier that day. When I stated, "I think I have borderline personality disorder," they just said, "What do you want us to do?" The only action they were equipped to take was to call the on-duty counselor who had to drive 40 minutes to get to campus. When I told her about my self harm and drinking and promiscuity she replied, "How does that make you different than any other student?" This further cemented my past notion that I was just weak: the numbness and loneliness - the desire to feel anything at all - was normal, and I just had a huge character flaw by not having the strength to be 'normal.' 

That night I got wasted and tried to swallow a whole bottle of caffeine pills at my friend's house. My intention was to induce a heart attack. He was one of the only people that I knew understood what I was feeling, but I never got a chance to tell him how close to the edge I was since his freshman girlfriend and two of her friends were with him that night. Not that it was his responsibility, but I just wanted confirmation that something wasn't right with me. While I was at his house, I tried to stay true to my 'carefree,' 'fun' person that I tried so hard portray while his girlfriend and her friends complimented my shirt and hair. It made me feel like such a fraud. Towards the end of the night, after I had swallowed those pills, my friend tried to get me to throw them up and then drove me to my dorm where I couldn't even find my room. I stumbled around and ran into the RA that had just gotten out of the shower and clung to him. I was scared and confused and felt so alone. I eventually got to my room and started cutting my already scarred wrist with baby scissors. I tried to cut into my femoral artery with those scissors as well, which was entirely unsuccessful. I settled for cutting my knee. At that moment, campus safety knocked on the door. I kept calm when they asked their usual questions, "Have you been drinking tonight?," etc., until they asked me to show them my wrists. That's when I panicked. Started screaming and crying uncontrollably. They escorted me to their office. I later learned one of the officers asked my roommate if I slept around. While I was incoherently yelling, an officer handed me a phone. It was my mom, and I cried that a death of a young man I knew in high school was my fault, and that I could have done something. (Background: His death wasn't my fault in any conceivable way. He OD'ed. I barely knew him &amp; didn't even know he was an addict, but I had a huge crush on him at the time and never acted on it. Through my warped logic, if I had been braver and talked to him, I could have 'saved' him.) 

The next day she was at my school ready to pick me up. She had flown on the next available flight to get to me. When I returned home, I went through months of therapy and psychiatry and yoga and meditation all arranged all by my mom. In the beginning, I was okay. Broken down and exhausted but seemingly on the mend. On some level, I was relieved that I had finally been diagnosed with something (went from depression to bipolar II to a depressive mood disorder). I worked really hard with my therapist to understand my guilt, disgust and trauma, which ironically had been entirely driven by ways I tried to cope with my depression. However, fully expecting to go back to college for the next semester, I was informed that I was not allowed to return yet. When I chose to leave in the middle of the semester, the dean didn't share the information that they had never let a student return from health leave until after six months of treatment. I had withdrawn from all my classes and sacrificed a semester's worth of my parents money thinking that I would be returning shortly and only a semester behind.

After that initial blow, my parents eventually gave me more freedom, I met and got involved with a guy that got me more into substances. He was going through issues of his own, which is why I connected with him. One morning, my parents tried to wake me up but couldn't. No need to go into further detail, but it was one step forward and two steps back (I no longer wanted to be 'nowhere' but was now using... alcohol... frequently). Despite alcohol being one of my main coping mechanisms, I was fortunate not to develop any dependencies or addictions.

A handful of months later, after my parents had taken away my phone and forced me to be supervised by them every night, I was accepted into a local university. I had also found a new therapist and psychiatrist. Their words stuck to me: 1) "Depression sucks and it most likely will be with you forever but there are ways of treating it." and 2) "You get to a point in your recovery where you can't blame your depression anymore. You just have to stand up and do your homework/go to your job/go to class." I was also lucky enough to have a couple professors that understood on a basic level what I was going through. One told me to show up to class no matter how miserable I was. I didn't bother to explain that depression wasn't about being miserable, but from there on out I did everything within my emotional power to go to class, even if I had drank before (that happened a couple times) or didn't participate (happened almost every time). I ended up getting a C or D in the class, but I take that as a win since I easily could have failed. Another professor asked student services to reach out to me after I hadn't shown up to class a couple weeks in a row. I learned there will be a lot of people that don't get it and don't want to get it, but the one or two that do make all the difference in the world.

Throughout my time at the new university, there were a lot of ups (meeting a close friend and actually making personal connections with people, excelling at the courses in my major) and downs (failing multiple classes and having to proactively withdraw due to 'special circumstances,' finishing an entire bottle of wine in an hour, crying and writing gibberish about how guilty I felt then inviting some random 30 year old I had met on Tinder over to my dorm room), but slowly I was piecing it together. I eventually got an on-campus job, then a full time internship then a full-time job.

While I'm not perfect these days, I've been at a job I never would have dreamed of for the past two and half years and have gotten a promotion.

Still, sometimes when the depression gets the best of me, I think that’s who I really am. This broken, beaten down person that's ashamed of basically her entire young adulthood. I fear that I don't want anything of substance. That I can’t find anything of substance. That I don't even know what I want. No path. No passion. When it gets that bad, it takes every ounce of strength I have to fight it. 

Even on good days, I can feel like it's in the back my mind. I'm terrified that it will come back, and I won't be able to control it. I'll give in to the thoughts that say I'm not good enough. You'll never be good enough. Everything you've dared to want will slip through your fingers, and you won't even know. All I do is think about how far I've come from that girl who swallowed a dozen caffeine pills. That girl who  thought she'd never be happy. And it gives me just enough strength to deny those feelings and smile.

I hope this wasn't too personal, but I wanted to be as raw and honest as possible. 

Thanks.
