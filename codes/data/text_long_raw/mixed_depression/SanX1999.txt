Not fearing any consequences for our actions?
"Not fearing any consequences or not fearing anything" is one of the feelings I have observed in myself. I am not able to study well, yet when test comes, I have no fear of the consequences of the failing tests, even though I am certainly failing it.

Same with my other habits, I eat like once in a day, which is an obligation I have put on myself to do at least once. Even then its very less than what any normal person of my age eats. I barely get 4-6 hours of sleep due to my schedule and not able to sleep quickly at night.

I know its not healthy, but aren't we supposed to do these things by fearing what will happen to ourselves? I think I have lost the fear of consequences of my actions.

Does anyone have this kind of experience?
