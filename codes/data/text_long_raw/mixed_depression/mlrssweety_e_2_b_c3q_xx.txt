I am a 26 year old married mother of three boys. I was recently diagnosed as having depression. I have noticed it getting a lot worse in just the past week. At first I thought to myself I don't have anything to be depressed about but the more I thought about it the more I realized what it was. Me and my husband used to spend time with our kids and go out and do things on Fridays or the weekends. I can't remember the last time we just went to Walmart as a family for no reason other than to go. My husband doesn't understand what the effect of him not spending that time with me and us has had on me. Just like tonight instead of asking me and the boys to run to town with him, his friend went. I don't care if he is only going for an hour that's an hour we could have his time. I cry all the time when he's not here just because I miss my husband. I'm 26 we should have a healthy active life with our kids but instead I work and come home, and on my days off I sit at home with my kids. When he is off he stays at home. He works and then him and his friend if they get off early go places in town and then he comes home. I don't get to do that. I can't remember the last time I just went window shopping, just running around. My thoughts about not being around have gotten worse and that terrifies me. How can I get my husband to understand that him spending time with me would help this so much. He just thinks it's a joke and that's one reason I think he wouldn't miss me if I'm gone except he would have to find another maid.
