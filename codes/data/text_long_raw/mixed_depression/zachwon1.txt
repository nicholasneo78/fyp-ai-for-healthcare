What’s the point in living?
Obviously with the title you would think I’m sad and hate myself or am severely suicidal. In reality, there’s truth to that, but I seriously do not see a point in living. I’ve tried different things to try and discover myself like spending 1500 dollars on camera equipment thinking maybe photography is my calling only to return it the next week. I’ve bought a jeep thinking maybe overlanding or off-roading is my thing and now I’m in the process of selling it. I have 1 friend that I hang out with once a month. I have 2 real life friends that I text occasionally. I haven’t had a girlfriend in several years now. 

Mind you I turn 20 years old tomorrow.

I don’t know what the next step in my life is? Who am I? Is there something more to me than just working then going home just to sleep all day? I’ve had a small problem with taking pain killers like oxy, vicodin, and codeine. I just don’t find any joy in any part of my life. I don’t want to die, but at the same time I wouldn’t mind not waking up tomorrow. I just want a passion. Something to live for. I don’t want to be like this, but I’ve tried different things all my life and I’ve lost all joy.

Is there a way to discover myself? Is that even an actual thing? What am I missing in my life? I just want to look forward to living another day rather than dreading it. 

To clarify, I don’t consider myself suicidal. I don’t WANT to die. I WANT a reason to be alive.
