No matter how much progress I make, I always fall right back down to rock bottom.
All my friends have forgotten about me, and no one supports my art (writing and music). I can't find bandmates and all I can see myself doing in the future is music, but my talent is mediocre at best. I don't know what else to do with my future and I only see dark days ahead. I fell in love with an exchange student, who's now my boyfriend, but now he's back in his home country and I don't have the money to visit him... and he has strict parents who will only pay for him to visit me once a year.

I'm sick of baggage from my childhood and teen years weighing me down and all this is just adding to it.
