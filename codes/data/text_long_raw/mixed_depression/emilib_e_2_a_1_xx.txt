I can't sleep again. My brain won't shut up. I have class at 9:00 am. I don't know if I am going to make it. When I lay in bed, all I can think about it how horrible I am. I mean, I am ugly, fat, a waste, stupid, worthless. When I talk to my boyfriend about it, he just says that I am great and beautiful. Then I just get mad at him, because I don't want to hear all that. It is not true. I have been trying to lose weight. I gained about 10 lbs over the summer, due to depression. Now all my clothes are really tight. I have been exercising and eating right for about a month, and still nothing has changed. The pants are all still uncomfortably tight, and no weight loss. I try really really hard to stay positive. But late at night, when I am alone and anyone close to me is hundreds of miles away, it is too hard. I end up hating myself. Telling myself horrible things. I hate myself. I want to be someone else. I want to be a better person.
