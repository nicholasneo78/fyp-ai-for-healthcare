Birthday Vent
I haven’t celebrated my birthday for years now. The most i’ve received is a happy birthday from my family, while the rest of my family gets full blown celebrations/dinners, etc. 

So considering everything I went into today expecting just the congratulations and that’s it, turns out my entire family went out to eat and celebrate the birthday of a family friend and left me behind. 

It hurt, but i guess people eventually get used to being ignored.  

Happy 20
