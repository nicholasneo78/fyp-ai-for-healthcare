Anyone get this feeling?
Does anyone else get the feeling like you're waiting for something to happen? Something great that will change your life for the better and make you finally happy. But you realize that there's no "thing", this is it. What is that? I feel like this all the time. Like I'm waiting on that thing to finally happen to fix it all..
