DAE not tell anyone about their depression for fear of being called an attention whore?
When I was a kid I was constantly getting called an attention seeker or an attention whore, mostly by the wonderful folks on r/teenagers, and know I’m not honest to anyone about my depression because I’m afraid I’ll come of as an attention whore and I don’t deserve to get help. DAE relate?
