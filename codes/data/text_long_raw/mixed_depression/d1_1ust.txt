The time is ticking .....
"It's just a matter of time"  ( well everything is a matter of time really )

"It's just a phase " ( it's not =) )

" get off your ass, how much time have you spent like a worthless vegetable " ( no , a lot and thanks )

" good days will come " ( but they never stay )

"Eh, you will grow out of it " ( good to know =)))

" I don't have time for your shit " ( I didn't invite you fam )

" kill yourself already, like what are you waiting for ? " ( the right moment )
