Little sister has depression, what do I do?
As the title says my baby sister has depression and I heard from my boyfriend this subreddit gives him support. I just discover the past summer that my little sister (14) has depression and is now cutting her self with razor blades. I warned my mother that I read her diary and she was counting calories first in September. Earlier this week I told her to keep an eye on her cause I think she is depressed, btw I live in another continent at home and thus have limited access on how much I see them. My mom said she will keep an eye to see if she is cutting herself or not. We recently discovered that she does in deed and her circle of friends have depression too. She is being bullied as well by one guy at school and confidant has depression and is cutting himself as well. 

She opened up to my parents and one of close friends who is a professional who works with children a lot, isnâ€™t a psychologist. 
My mom is very supportive as well as the rest of my family and we just want to help my little sister. My mom is not sure what to do, and neither am I. I suggested to look for professional help for her, as she is harming herself. However, we are not sure what to do about her surroundings. Most of her friends have depression and she is doing badly in school on top of that she is being bullied. What do you guys think? Change her of school and remove her from the toxic environment or leave her there and get her a psychologist?
