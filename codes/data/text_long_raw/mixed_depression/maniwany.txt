It's become a personality trait
Depression has become part of my identity. As much as I'd like to say it doesn't define me, it really does, it controls my life enough to debilitate my every day experiences. I know we have one life and that there's nothing after that but that fact isn't motivating. In many moments like this I'm convinced that this is all life is and can be and the repetitive, short range, unchanging emotions is my proof. Feels completely pointless and childish to even vent, me writing this feels ridiculous.
