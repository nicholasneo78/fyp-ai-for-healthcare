Therapy didn't work for me at all.
As long as I can remember I have been depressed, and have been thinking about killing myself. Last year it got to the point where I decided I needed to try therapy. I went for a while, but there was no improvement. During this period I just got worse and worse until I stopped going. I wish it would have worked, but it didn't. I want to try it again, but since I am unemployed I can't afford it, and even if I could, I don't think I want to spend money on something that I doubt will help. I have no idea what to do. I keep getting worse...
