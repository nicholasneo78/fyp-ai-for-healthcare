You don't have to read this, it's just a short story.

A few years ago i was in love with a guy, we were in the same course at school.  I got so nervous every time I saw him. However, he didn't say a word to me. He ignored me. He didn't even look at me. I didn't want to ignore him, i tried to get his attention, but i just didn't manage. It frustrated me. I just didn't understand why he deliberately ignored me. I was so down, I started cutting again, didn't eat for days, ...

It lasted one year. The whole year he never said a word to me. Not even when my sister died.

I don't understand it today and I never will. I never will forget the pain. However, i don't blame him for ignoring me. Everybody has the right to ignore me. But it hurts me so much.

And today I always get the feeling people ignore me. And when people i care about do so, it's horrible. Maybe they don't deliberately ignore me, but i always think they do. For me it's the worst thing you can do to a person. It's worse than hating somebody.

I wrote a poem for this guy, it's not good, but i want to share it.

Don't blame me

Don't blame me for thinking of you, because you just don't know how i feel

You never knew me and you never will, but i know you so well, yes i do.

Don't blame me for dreaming of you, because you just don't know how much it hurts

You are so far away, but you're in my dreams, there i can reach you, yes i can.

Don't blame me for searching for you because you don't know how much i miss you

You never looked at me like i look at you, I need you, i always will

Don't blame me for loving you, because you just don't know how i feel

You never knew me and you never will, but i love you so much, yes i do.
