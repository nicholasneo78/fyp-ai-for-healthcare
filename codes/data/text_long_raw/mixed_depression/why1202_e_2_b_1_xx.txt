I'm sitting here at what is my 26th or 27th job (I can barely keep count. I'm 27 years old by the way). I already hate it and I've been here one month today. I don't think it's normal to have this many jobs over a lifetime, let alone when you're just in your late 20's. I've applied for disability before but was denied. I don't dispute the fact that I can get a job, I just can't keep a job. I get bored, I get anxiety attacks, I get to the point where I don't want to go outside at all. I'll never be able to work (successfully) with all those things going on. When I went to see an attorney to appeal my disability decision, he said I should find a job with minimal responsibility. What kind of job is that? Don't you have to be responsible enough to at least come to work (and on time)? Don't you have to be responsible to follow the rules of the job? I can't seem to do either one. Each job I get, I think "maybe this can be the job I can stay at" and it never happens. The longest I've ever stayed at a job is 1 year. I just feel like such a loser. Everyone I know always says they'll do whatever kind of job for their kids, or I should be lucky to have a job. I can see their point, but when I feel so miserable I can't see past that. I drag myself to jobs only to end up quitting or getting myself fired. What's wrong with me? Any advice? Anyone?
