I willingly admit that I am a sufferer of depression. But in my case, I think the problem was education more than anything. I recognize that I have been depressed pretty much from as far back as I can remember. I'm not sure where I got the misinformation but I spent most of my life believing that it was just me, just life, you know, the thinking that some people were lucky and happy and I just wasn't. I'm 34 now so it is a wonder that I made it to this point, considering the statistics. I think that I tried to destroy myself in other ways like smoking and minor drugs and not taking care of myself. Basically I was waiting for things to either get better or finish falling apart. About a year ago, my new doctor recognized the symptoms in me and offered me help in the form of Zoloft and some counseling which changed my life. The problem then became that I changed jobs and lost my insurance with no hope of COBRA so I actually went of the drug cold turkey (highly not recommended, believe me) and am now back where I started. Have any of you found yourselves in this situation? What do you do?
