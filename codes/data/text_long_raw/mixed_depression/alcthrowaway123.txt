19 and never had a relationshp
Boys show me attention, but I always deny them and I don't know why. I have never done anything with a guy even though there have been so many opportunities presented to me, but I always say no. I want a boyfriend, I want to have sex. All my friends are in relationships. I think there is something wrong with me because I keep saying no to the things I want. I feel lonely.
