I'm a traitor. I went to check out the other room without anyone knowing that it was me, just to see who was in there. While I saw someone stabbing me in the back, someone else pm'd me. Having a go, blah blah, how I shouldn't discriminate against people and make them leave THIS room.

I was thinking "wtf?" I never made people leave this room. All my problem people are on ignore and are left there *as it is in the rules*

So anyway, I just turns out that someone let this person know that I was a host from this forum masquerading, as if to get information from these people that have "abandoned" this chat. I Don't care about the other chat, other people shouldn't.
You guys are welcome to wherever you want to go. You are banned for putting the link in the room and whispering it to people, which is AGAINST the rules.
I know that the person that pm'd me feels bad, It ISN'T my fault. I didn't yell at her for making the mistake, I was understanding. I've made that mistake, I feel bad for it when I do. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO MESS UP.

So why people must bring stuff from THAT room into THIS room and make me so frigging angry again that I have to leave is beyond me. Why, if there are two separate rooms, can't stuff from the rooms STAY IN THAT ROOM?!?!
It's so much easier. People won't get confused that way.

At this point I would just like to reiterate that I have no problems whatsoever with any of the people that go to either room. Anyone I can't handle talking to, I don't talk to. I just take objection to being asked about it here, where I come to forget about my problems, not be reminded of them.

And now, I've totally lost the thread of where I was going with this post, thanks to a whole bunch of reasons, and I'm getting too stressed to type, and all that's just irritated me further.

When I remember the point, I will add it or post it underneath.

Be strong and stay safe.
