I don't know what to do with myself anymore.
Last year, I met a wonderful friend online. We began dating in February of 2017 and have been inseparable ever since. However, we both have mental illnesses, for me I have PTSD and depression, and for him ADHD and depression. He's being treated for both, I'm untreated because of my family and our financial situation.

I'm afraid I'm frustrating him. I feel like I'm dragging him down. He's tried to get me to take better care of myself, but it's hard, seeing as we're long distance and I always slip back into my bad habits. I feel like I pissed him off tonight and I never understood why he got frustrated, but now I think I do. No matter what, I didn't really listen or heed his advice, and I'm afraid because of that he's going to decide that I'm unmanageable and he'll leave me. I'm terrified I'm going to make him resent me.

I'm at my wit's end, he's my best friend and I'm very in love with him, but I just don't know how to be better for him. I'm up at 3 in the morning, school tomorrow, crying because I'm afraid of losing the one person who hasn't given up yet. I don't know what to do.
