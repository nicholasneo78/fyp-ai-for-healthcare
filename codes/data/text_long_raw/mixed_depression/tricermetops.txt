Need more info about depression and other mental illnesses?
I’m currently watching Kati Morton on YouTube and I always recommend her channel to people who wants to know more about depression or how to deal with it esp if you don’t have any therapist. I don’t know her personally at all! Just sharing this cause there are some things that my therapist and I haven’t discussed yet or some coping methods she haven’t mentioned to me that I found very helpful from Kati’s channel. I hope it helps you too in one way or another!
