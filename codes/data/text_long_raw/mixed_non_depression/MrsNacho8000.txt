What's the deal with my husband's future best friends wife?
Hi everyone, I am having a problem and I'm not sure what to do about it. I am led to believe that my future husband's (married next month) best friend's wife dislikes me, but I'm getting mixed signals. I have always (I thought) been nice to her. 

When we hang out as couples, everything is fine and we get along great. We have a similar education level and both come from a science background, so it's easy for us to talk. We have spent hours hanging out in these situations. We even all took a road trip together this past summer a few states away to attend a very lovely (albeit very strange) wedding of another of their mutual friends, and we went out to dinner and shopping while the boys were at the bachelor party. 

It seems like whenever I try to plan anything though, she isn't available, even if her husband is. I planned a surprise party for my fiances 30th birthday that I had been talking about for months--her husband was there, and at the last minute, she couldn't attend. He didn't even tell me she wasn't coming until he showed up without her. We visited their home on 4th of July weekend and there invited them to my parents house (they have a pool) for the holiday. He showed up, she didn't because she was "sick" (read: hungover.) Her husband showed up for an hour or so and she was continually calling him asking when he was going to come home and take care of her. 

The thing that makes me think this isnt a string of coincidences is my bridal shower. It is tomorrow, and I have found out she will not be attending. She Rsvpd to my mom with just a generic "I can't make it, we're busy" but then a few days later, her husband messaged my fiance asking if he wanted to hang out on the day of my shower.

I have always been nice to her, and I'm not sure whats going on. Anyone in Reddit land have any advice? Her husband and my future husband have been best friends since high school and this is bugging both of us.
