Bad Stepmom?
I was married for 17 years to a man who refused to work and who sat and watched TV all day. I divorced him to find a better situation.
I married my current husband on Sept 1, 2017. On 10/6/17 he lost his job. Now I feel as if I'm back where I started. I have to pay for everything. On top of it, he invited his 18-year-old daughter to move in with us without asking me, even though I'm paying for everything. Suddenly I'm paying for her groceries and everything else on top of his. Then, I'm informed by my husband that his daughter's boyfriend is going to spend every weekend here: Friday night through Sunday afternoon. Now I'm feeding him too. To make matters worse, the daughter and her boyfriend are loud and inconsiderate. They leave messes in the kitchen, living room, her room, etc. I miss my quiet house. Paying for him and I is more than enough. Am I selfish to not want to support her and her boyfriend too? I have a house in a different city but he refused to move there because my young adult kids live there. So I have to pay for 2 households because he refuses to move there, yet I have to live with his daughter. I'm about ready to run back home to my other house and call this quits. I feel used and taken advantage of. Thoughts?
