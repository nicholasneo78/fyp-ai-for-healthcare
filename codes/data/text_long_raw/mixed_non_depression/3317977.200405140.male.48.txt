 Last week it all came to a head after months of holding it in,  I quit my job and this is what happened:  You know how little things can build up and you hold it inside  until you can't take it any more? Well thats what I did.   I came back last week at the end of the day and Jim started on  me about something that was of no big deal but I blew up and started  yelling at him and him at me and the next thing I know I quit.  I stormed out of the office and went home. It hit me what I had  just done about half way home.  I knew I was wrong in geting mad and quiting but what was done was done. I went home and told my wife and she didn't say a word.
