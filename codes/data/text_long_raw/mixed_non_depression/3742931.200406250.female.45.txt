 Let's try this again:)  Life is so wonderful, today I talked to my good friend Becky and she's here for a visit from Florida.  Lucky me!  We're going to get together on Monday night for a visit, and probably again Tuesday.  We've always had such a strong relationship, it doesn't matter how long between our visits they're always fun and she's so easy to be with.  She's a great MOM, and it's all she ever wanted was a family of her own.  Tonight another buddy is on his way to our home for a weekend visit, and tonight we're going out with friends.  Just trying to pack it all in before Mike and Courtney leave for AZ.  Every weekend is going to be full....full with family and friend time.  The biggest surprise is that today the weather actually cooperated, not gorgeous out but nicer than we had had lately.
