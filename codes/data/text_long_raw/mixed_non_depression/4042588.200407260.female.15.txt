 So...I just got back from shopping with Keeley.  It was so much fun because we decided almost everything that we were going to buy for school, but it kind of sucked ass because we only had twenty each.  I still managed to get a really cute shirt from Old Navy.. but it's kind of see through... oh well!  I'm just going to haev to look a little sleazy! Hahaha! Well, yet again, I have nothing more to write.
