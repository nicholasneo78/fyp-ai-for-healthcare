 ok, is this working???? All right, I think I may be doing it right. Is this bold. ?? I don't think bold is working. Let me look in preview. Nope. WTF. I am so glad that no one actually reads this. What a completely frusterating process. I can't figure out how to do anything on this site besides post titles of my current blog, and yes, I AM A LAW STUDENT. Whatever. F off. You would be confused to. It may be b/c it's almost 1:30 in the morning and I shopped like Paris today. Whee! Oh, woe is me, shopped myself delerious. Isn't life grand? I think it is. Shannon thinks it's better. I'll let you ask her why. Okie dokie, absolutely nothing to say, just typing b/c I have obsessive compulsive disorder and no one else is awake to talk to me. No one really is on instant messenger either, so I am sitting here giving myself arthritis b/c I had a diet coke too late and have to do something to keep busy. Some read Shakespeare, I am aimlessly blogging. What is this world coming to? I'm outie.
