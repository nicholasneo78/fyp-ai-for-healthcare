 YAY! We are refinancing our home! I just finished up my first week as a real time graphic designer too. Working at Trinity Lutheran College is really great. I love the fact that I have my own office. I put in a work order to have it painted and have some extra junk hauled out of there! So I can personalize it as I please.   On another note. I can't stand Keith the Freecycle South King County moderator. He is so annoying! It is like he only owns the group to rule over people to build his own ego it is so annoying.   Paul, Riley and I went to the Lincoln Park wading pool after work today. It got up to 92 degrees today so it was nice to get our feet wet. Riley really likes wading pools. We just walked around with her. Then we went and had dinner at Spuds and walked along Alki.
