I'm a soon to be nurse and I'm gathering data on my thesis regarding the effect of divorce on children.
Hello /r/family,

I am graduating this year from my local university and I am gathering data on my thesis which is researching the effects of parents' divorce on their children's personalities and relationships. If your parents divorced, I would be extremely grateful if you could spend a few minutes of your time on completing my survey: 

[Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekRsQyf-6nFtMPvBG0bIR2ytVc_hZGdQ9tvU_u3bcDKYsQhA/viewform)

I welcome answers from those who do not have divorced parents as well, as I have some generic relationship related questions too. And of course I will share the results later on, when enough answers have accumulated that I can make meaningful statistics from them.

Thank you for reading this, and also if you decide to fill the survey!
