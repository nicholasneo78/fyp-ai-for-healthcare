 I'm sitting here at 2:30 A.M. wondering . . . is it possible to fall in love with a place?  Is it possible to want to be somewhere so much that you would forsake everything . . . just to have a moment in that place?  I think that is what Chicago is to me, as corny as that may be.  I'm interviewing for jobs at the moment, and I can't sleep.  Part of me really wants the job, but another part wants to fly on a whim.  I know what I   should   do, but there is a great difference between what you should do and what you want to do.  I am so nervous right now--about the job, about the possibility of moving, about everything.  I'm literally at a time in my life when I am in serious upheaval.  It's a transition period, and I don't like it.  I wish I had a crystal ball that would tell me where I will be in five years, ten, twenty even.  Maybe then I would know the path that I am supposed to take.  But no one can tell you that, can they?  You can only do what you feel you should and hope that it is the right decision.  Jen
