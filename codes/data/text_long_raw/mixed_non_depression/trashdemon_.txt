Should I call my friend out on his bs?
My friend is a guy.
It seems like he wants to be oppressed so badly. It’s kinda funny but mostly insulting. 

A few nights ago he was telling me that he was bi-racial (mix of two races, would happen if Mom and dad were different races) even though both of his parents are white af and he isn’t adopted. 

He told me he has autism and was disabled even though he exhibits 0 autistic traits and I know he hasn’t been diagnosed. When I ask him what his disability is, he always gives shady or different answers. 

He keeps saying he has schizophrenia but when I ask, he is always like “what? ...... oh yea” like he needs to be reminded about an illness that is supposed to seriously impact his life.

He keeps telling me he is gay but after a little drinking he tells be about a girl he has a crush on. 

It is funny seeing min try so hard to be in an oppressed minority when he clearly is not but it is also really insulting because I am in a minority. I am disabled and have to be on a wheelchair, I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and I’m lgbt. 

What should I do?
