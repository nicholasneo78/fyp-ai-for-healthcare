 To whom it may concern, I have been thinking and have concluded that I think too much. Why? My brain hurts almost all the time. The boys that I hang out with all fight at the one time. I get headaches all the time and usually Grenda* comes in to stop them but it is usually carries on out side. At least 2 have crushes on me and one has declared there love for me! HELP if any one can give me advice it is welcomed. regards, Kitty
