 Last night Jerry Douglas came to town and played a free concert. That guy is SO GOOD. He made me want to learn to play the dobro. And the best part was that his fiddle player had a mohawk. It was kind of like the whole band was saying, "Even though we play bluegrass instruments, we're WAY beyond bluegrass." They even had the same bass player as Nickel Creek. I wonder if that guy goes around joining bluegrass bands and then turning them into non-bluegrass bands. Or maybe in this case it was Jerry's idea. Maybe he got too sick of bluegrass from playing with Alison Krauss. Well it was a really great concert, nonetheless.
