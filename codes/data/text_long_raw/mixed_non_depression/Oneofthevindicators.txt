How to deal with indecisive parents?
My parents are unbelievably indecisive. They make every single day about making a big decision about who moves to which country and it’s horrible. 

I’ve lived in New Zealand for almost ten years now, and three years ago my dad moved back to the UK for work. Every single day my mother asks me if she and my brother should go back and join him, and if so where am I going to live?

When I was 15 I was told we were moving to Australia. I had to report this to my dean and even had to say goodbye to all my friends, only to be told (and have to sheepishly tell my friends) it was not happening after all. Now I am 21 and it does not get any easier or less embarrassing. 

I was really excited when they promised to put me in a dorm at uni this year. I went to boarding school and loved it so I was really excited; my mum even took me to Briscoes looking for dorm equipment for me for Christ’s sake. They got me worked up like this for a good three months before telling me it’s not going to happen after all. I mean it would have been fine if they had not got the idea in my head. 

I can not take it any more. It is mentally exhausting and I have spent the past 6-7 years feeling powerless and anxious. 

Does anyone else have such indecisive parents? And if so how do you deal with the 24 hour stress that you find yourself in? 

Sorry for the long post!
