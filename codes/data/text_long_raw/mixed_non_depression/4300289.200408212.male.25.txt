 Hey ... I'm baaaaack ...  Lots of you guys have e-mailed me, asking me to start up the UrbanBoys newsletter again.  I know how much many of you enjoyed it.  Well, how about a compromise?  I'll start this blog, and you can all help me out.  Let me know what you want to see ... it's all yours!  Right now, I'm just getting things set up ... in the next few hours or days, I hope to get the format ready and get started!
