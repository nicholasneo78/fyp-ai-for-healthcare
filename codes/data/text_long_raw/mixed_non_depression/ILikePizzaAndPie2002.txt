Is it normal for a dad to say this to his daughter?
Sorry if this isn’t the right sub. Just need an outsiders opinion on this issue. My dad will often make *jokes* about my weight, for example: Tonight we were having dessert and I didn’t want any, he told me to stuff it in my fat little face. A few days ago, I was eating chips and he said I’m gonna get chubby, before that, he says stuff like “Nobody likes the fat chick” He says I’m gonna “get fat like my mom when I’m older” that’s another thing, my parents are divorced due to my mom cheating and if I’m being sarcastic towards him or anything he says “I’m gonna give you to your mom if you’re not careful.” It’s like I’m an object instead of a person? I do a hell of a lot of housework and all, it hurts to hear him *joke* about that.

I just feel like this isn’t something you should say to your 15 y/o daughter. He’s a great dad besides the comments he makes here and there. I got pretty upset by the comment he made tonight cause I’ve been dealing with weight issues and self esteem. He didn’t understand why I got upset cause it’s a joke to him. I dunno, am I being overly sensitive?
