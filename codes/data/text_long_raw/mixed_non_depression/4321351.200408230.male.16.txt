 Why did I have to be your mistake? Put together with pieces of me and you... You had to change me into something you could never be, I'm not me anymore, I'm just like you, the sad thing is that you knew...  I was never a person in the first place, Just like the rest, there was nothing inside me but dust... You saw potential for an evil heir to your throne, I knew there was something more than hate, but now I'm not so sure just what to trust...  They all point fingers at me and blame, They're just like you, thinking they're perfect... I can see through them, like you saw through me, Just like me, they're all a defect...  Why did I have to be your mistake? Why did you have to make me aware? I wish sometimes that I couldn't see, Cause when I look in the mirror, you're there...
