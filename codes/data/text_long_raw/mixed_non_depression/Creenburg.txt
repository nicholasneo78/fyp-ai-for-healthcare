Today, my mother tried to commit suicide.
Due to recent family events, it awakened childhood feelings of abandonment, inadequacy, and loneliness in my mom. She felt alone. Luckily, she was too coward to utilize her personal firearm. She chose to drink herself into an oblivion and inhale exhaust fumes. 

The exhaust fumes made her tired, and in her tired stupor, she thought she could sit outside and freeze to death. She had a bottle of heart pressure medication as a backup. I thank my lucky stars that she fell asleep in the grass instead. Her attempt was unsuccessful.

Originally I blamed myself for having been hard on her. I have always been honest with my mother, and she has always kept a strong face. But today I learned how fragile she truly is. 

I take it upon myself to protect her, and support her, no matter what. She raised me and continues to raise my younger siblings. It’s time that we give back. 

I have been thankful that I have not suffered the loss of someone I love to suicide. I thought that I would see the signs if it were going to happen. I didn’t. I will be more aware and I will show my love for people I care about. I often think about the ones I love but don’t take the time to reach out. 

That changes today. I refuse to hold back my love for fear of being hurt and pushed away, for the people I love are not hearing it enough but still stay.

I am grateful for the second chance with my mother. I have thought often about missing her someday when she dies. I never thought that it might come so soon. I am renewed and reborn. My goals and ambitions stronger than ever.  My love for my family renewed in the wake of our war. My mother the warrior on the front lines, taking the shots from sibling to sibling and softening the blow so we all can continue the crusade.

This will change. Today I choose to love.
