Fear of leaving
Tl;dr; Sob story. I think i don’t love my mother as much as i should.

I am looking to leave to Australia with my Australian husband.  I have a small family and I am very close to my dad’s side. 

I don’t feel like i have much ties to Canada except for my dad, his wife and my grandmother. I also have a young niece on my mother’s side (me and my brothers don’t have the same father). 

I’m scared of missing out on my niece growing up.

I’m scared my grandmother will get sick and i won’t be there fast enough.

I’m scared of the same thing for my dad. He’s still in a very good shape but i’m his only child.

Most of all, it makes me realise that i won’t really miss my mother. I love her but i am not close to her in any way and we don’t really get along. And i know she will make a big deal about me leaving even though we’ve never had a real relationship. 

I feel bad about this. Anyone else in that kind of boat? Loving one of your parents less?
