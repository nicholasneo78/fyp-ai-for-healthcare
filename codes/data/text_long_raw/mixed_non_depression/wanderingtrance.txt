In law family vacation + newborn
My husband and I have been married since August 2016. I am now pregnant due in April. We have been going on vacation with his parents for the last 3 yrs with his 2 sisters and last year their husband's too. They assume that we will be going on vacation this year too, the baby would be 4 months old I DONT WANT TO GO. FYI, his dad is great and hands off and his mom is very opinionated and gives too much advice but she means well and has been nothing but good to me. 

Reasons I don't want to go

1. We have lived with them for the past 5 months, I need a vacation from THEM. I am used to my own space and being able to retreat, I no longer really have that.

2. It will be a 4 hr car ride with a four month old. It may not be that big a deal but other than the car ride, I just rather be home and comfortable and not in another state staring at a beach for 7 days that I don't even want to be at.

3. My husband's older sister has gone out of her way to make me feel excluded in the past and said borderline mean comments. We made some headway last year but I barely tolerate her and avoid her and really don't want to be stressed out for 7 days because of it plus taking care of My baby. Everyone else doesn't see this, or sees her aggressive behavior as assertive.

4. I don't even know why I've gone the last 3 years as by the 3rd day I am drained. I am trying to better listen to myself instead of forcing myself to endureeat something I don't have to

My question is how do I tell them we are not going (my husband is backing me 100%) specially cause I know my MIL will resist 

Do you guys think it's ok that I don't want to go
