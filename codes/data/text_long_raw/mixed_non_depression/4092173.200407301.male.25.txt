 The typical debate exists between the chicken and the egg. The question I am compelled to ask is on the level of the chick/egg, but has far more substance. So, what came first, the dude or the ness? The chicken does not exist without the egg, nor the egg without the chicken. The dude and the ness however can exist as separate entities, but combined, they are Dudeness. 'nough said.
