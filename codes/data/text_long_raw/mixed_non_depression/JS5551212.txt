Unreturned texts
An old college dorm friend who started organizing reunions I saw twice last year with other former classmates has not responded to my last two texts including a Holiday greeting to him and his family-- which I consider rude. I made it a point to keep in touch with people especially during the holidays. Am tempted to zap this person and drop him but my wife says to let it slide. I would not say we are close but am perplexed at the rudeness of not even mustering a reply to a holiday greeting even if its fake. I've done nothing to this person except it came out during our last group get together that I went on to get a law degree at an elite school. I never even discuss careers or money at these things if that is the reason. Baffling.
