 For the month of August, I have samples of my photography on display at The Coffee House in downtown Lincoln, NE. The majority of the prints are black & white, but there are a few color prints as well.  One thing, however...I stopped in yesterday (8-2-2004) to check things out, and noticed that my photos haven't been hung yet.  I am hoping this will be resolved soon...preferably this week.  If you stop in, you will be able to tell my work, as mine is all framed.  In any case, stop down and check it out, and have a great cup of coffee while you are wandering around!  Knightsabre
