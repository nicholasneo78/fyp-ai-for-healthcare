Young father looking for new pen-friends
Sup guys, not sure that chose correct section.

Two years ago i became husband and father. So since that moment i lost connection with all my friends, cause they still single and all the time hang out in night clubs and also made focus on my career. It's really impossible to find young and maybe successfull fathers like me in offline. Like you know, there are a lot of communities for mothers and nothing for fathers.

So, main idea of this topic is to find people who want talk about fatherhood, cars, work, vacation and so on in chat like whatsapp/telegram etc.
