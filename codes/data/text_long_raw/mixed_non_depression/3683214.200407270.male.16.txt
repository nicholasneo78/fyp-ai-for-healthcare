 This is intense ever since I came to college. Never would have thought it would be this hard. Back when I was in Highschool, I really loved math! I don't know what happened. They just teach very fast in college. Not the usual thing I'm used to. So, wether people liked math or so, I'll find a waay or another to delete math out of my life. Although I know I'm going to need it in the future anyway!
