 So...this is my first entry in my blog.  I've had blogs before, but I seem to never update them...and then I forget what the website is to my blog.  Hopefully I'll update this one.  So, my name is Tiffany, I live in Virginia Beach, and I'm going to be a sophomore at Princess Anne High School in September.  I am a Madrigal in my school's chorus, which is supposed to be an honor, but it really isn't.  My best friend is Keeley.  She is so awesome and is just like me; we met at the beginning of the school year, when she moved here from San Diego.  Which is kind of funny because that is where I was born.  We were very lucky this year to go traveling together with our school.  We are both drama geeks and got to go to a thespian conference at Longwood University and we also got to go to New York City, which was absolutely amazing.  After going to New York I decided that I am going to move there when I get out of high school.     Anyways... I am currently in a production of the play Twelfth Night by Shakespeare.  It has been such an amazing experience and I have made some great friends.  First there's Matt... he is so sexy, talented, and fun to be around, but unfortunately he is gay.  Then there's Sam... he is also sexy, talented, and fun to be with, but he has a girlfriend who he is absolutely in love with.  Rebekkah, who is almost exactly like me, is so much fun to be with..."She kills me!"  Unfortunately, we only have three more performances and then it's all over.    Well that's all I really have to say right now.... but I'll right more later.
