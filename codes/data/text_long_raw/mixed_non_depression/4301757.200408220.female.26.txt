 Yesterday I spent my day playing on the Internet and bummed that Erin has not called me back. I really big crush on her. I really miss being with someone and I am definitely looking for love - which is very unlike me.  Greg and I went out last night. I haven't seen him all summer. He was amazingly beautiful as always. It was the first time my friends were introduced to him. My girlfriends went on and on about how hot he was. Eric, my ex, was actually the first to tell me, "he is a handsome guy," which I thought was really funny. We got extremely drunk and danced all night long. He came home with me, but I puked before anything could happen.  I like Greg. He is smart and he challenges me intellectually. He is also a great dancer and an awesome kisser. I just dont know if I want a man in my life. I've developed this weird fear of men when it comes to intimacy. Things are a bit different with Greg, probably because he's not acting like he is in love with me. I wonder when he will call again....  Other then that, I am actually considering meeting up with Internet friends at the lesbian bar on Saturday. I'll probably chicken at the out last minute.  I'm going to try my best not to over-think the Greg thing. Or the girl thing. Or anything for that matter.
