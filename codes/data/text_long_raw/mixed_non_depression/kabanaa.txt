My dad is dealing with anxiety/depression
Hey,

Im 22 years old and i still live with my parents, recently it was been very hard for everyone of us. My dad suffers from bad anxiety and most likely depression for the past 3 weeks he got some panic attacks one leading to him calling the ambulance (thinking he was getting a heart attack)

I know for a fact that this has been passed down to me to. I also suffer from anxiety  but i learned more to deal with it now. But  times like this it gets a little harder.

We lost our dog 4 weeks ago and just a week after  that my father lost his brother so its most likely that which is causing the high anxiety and depression(?) 

It brings the whole family down and i'm a bit worried about my father but i don't know what to do. We have been talking about this and he is aware that he is suffering from anxiety, but we all do to some extent i guess. But he is in a bad place right now. Maybe i just wanted to get stuff out my chest. 


Any suggestions?
