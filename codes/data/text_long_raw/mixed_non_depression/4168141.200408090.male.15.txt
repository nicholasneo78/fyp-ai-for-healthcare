 I went to the little lockin at Magic Springs last night and we were there from 10 at night till 4 in the morning. It was not worth the money. That's messed up that it cost $17 when I bought a pass. That's why I bought a pass, so I didn't have to pay to get in. I'm really tired today. I'm kind of disapointed that Jaclyn was out of town this weekend. We were supposed to go bowling tonight but she had to go to El Dorado. I would have rather gone bowling than to Magic Springs. I think this chick at the church was stalking me. I was walking alone, thinking about stuff, and she saw me and left her friends to walk with me. I had not even met her before tonight but, it turns out she was one of my ex girlfriends best friends sister. How ironic? Oh well, she was pretty cool. Then when we got back to the church we watched t.v. Well, most everybody slept. Jenna tried but I kept her awake, he he he. Jenna and I finally got to talk, I'm glad I got that stuff off my chest. Thanks Jenna. Jaclyn would be proud of me today, I slept from 6:30 this morning to 3:00 this afternoon. I'm still really tired though so I think all I need to say has been said. L8r.
