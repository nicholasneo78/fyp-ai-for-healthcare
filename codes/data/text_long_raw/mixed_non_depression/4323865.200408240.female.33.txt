 Today was an intresting day to say the least. Sometimes I wonder way the hell things are the way they are. I try to be a nice person but when you are nice, people will run the hell all over you. Today I had to turn in my best friend for getting a traffic ticket and giving the officer my name instead of hers. Did I just call her my best friend?........ With friends like that i'm set for life huh?. Well I bet she wont do it again. I guess I can cross her name off my Christmas list.    On another note my son had a good day in school today. I couldn't be more proud. I was so worried when he started school but I think that he will do fine.    As for my love life, thats not doing fine at all. I am intrested in someone but I just don't think he sees it, or me for that matter. I've done everything possible to get him to notice me.   Don't get me wrong we talk quite often but there is always people around. Hell maybe he just isn't intrested. I could see that as the problem. I'll keep hoping. I have nothing better to do.........
