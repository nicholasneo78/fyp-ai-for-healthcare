How do I know if my friend is sincere?
How do I know that a friend who says that she's my friend is actually sincere? She says things like I'm one of the best people she knows. The enthusiasm is disproportionate to some of the things she's done. She's given me thoughtful gifts like chocolates, books or an adult colouring book (I like art). But when we travelled around together she put up stark boundaries - like she'd not even let me in her room to help her out with a mouse which showed up, even though she complained like she needed the help. Also, she only makes the time to reply to my messages about once per week. I can say that confidently because I know she's online most of the time on Facebook. I can see it. Has anyone got such "friends"? Is this normal?
