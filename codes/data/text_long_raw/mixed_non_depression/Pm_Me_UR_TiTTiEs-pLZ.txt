Moving away from family and the family business
Im 25 and have lived within an hour of my family my whole life. I work for the family business, so Ive seen my dad and brother every day for the last 6 years. I believe it causes me extra stress and when I mess up at work it feels twice as bad. Have any of you been in a similar situation?
