 Hello again my fellow internetites to One Fruit Loop Short of a Cereal Bowl.  Tonight was sparring class in karate and my friend, Kasey came to watch me! I guess I did ok. Who's the Boss is on and its not funny but Alyssa Milano is hottt! I'm reading a book right now called  Kings of Infinite Space  its really good.  It's kinda like Office Space but with zombies. I'm also playin True Crime for the ps2 and I am having problems trailing this bastard but its all good. Two great webcomics im reading are megatokyo.com and rpgworldcomic.com they are very funny if youre an anime/rpg nerd like I am. I cant wait for next week cause I'm gonna go see Spider-Man 2, its gonna be pimp!  See Ya!
