 I've heard about blogs quite a bit and finally decided to test the waters of putting one together.  I'll be curious to see if this changes my life any.  I'm sitting in my recently-painted TV room watching some show about ancient man-made things found off the island of Malta.  It's typical Science Channel stuff.  I love anything like that.  I'm also sitting in various chat rooms right now, but not really monitoring what is going on in them.  But if someone wants to chat me, that's cool.  I'll chat back -- maybe.  The TV room is now Ruby Red.  Or as a friend of mine called it -- "Ho Red".  It was a bitch to paint.  But I did it all myself.  It took one coat of primer and 4 coats of the red.  There is still minor color differentiation, but you can't really see it that much.  I'm probaby the only one that would notice them.
