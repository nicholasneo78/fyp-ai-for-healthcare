 For half the day I practiced a song that my sisters and I are singing at my Dad's 4th wedding Friday night.  The song is a bit ironic considering his track record, but what are you going to do?  I was pleasantly surprised with how well it went.  Now we just have to try it at the church with amplification.  Scary!!  It is mildy terrifying as I haven't sung in public for approx. 11 years.  I figure if I just close my eyes I'll be okay.  I am really dreading the whole weekend.  We have the rehearsal on Thursday night, rehearsal for a wedding my son is in at 3pm on Friday, Dad's wedding at 6:30pm Friday night, than the other wedding at 1pm on Saturday.  I won't have a minutes breathing space until Sunday, on which we are invited to my nephews birthday party.  Bleah!!!!  And sometime in there, B has to fix his bosses car that is apart in our garage.  I really do hate weekends like this almost as bad as Guard weekend.
