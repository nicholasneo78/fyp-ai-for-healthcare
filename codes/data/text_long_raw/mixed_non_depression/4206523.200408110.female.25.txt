 I have always wanted to write a book. Just like I have always wanted to finish college, and be a movie star and get married and have kids and own a trampoline. Ooh, and I wanted to be my own boss and be able to take off work whenever I want and not have to make up a reason for calling in sick.  I have accomplished a couple of those things, but not the book. Not yet. I love to tell stories about the things I saw when I was a child. Most of them are true, and some are simply told through the perspective of a 10 year-old's imagination that has become true to this 25 year-old woman. Do you want to hear them?
