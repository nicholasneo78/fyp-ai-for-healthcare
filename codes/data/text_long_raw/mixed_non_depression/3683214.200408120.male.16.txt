 Speech Communication  is a  GE  course of mine..and one of my favored subjects as well as hated..  I love it because of our  teacher..Mr. Elmer Rufo..a gay..and a funny man..I mean..woman..as he would like to be. He's directing a play called Antigone. Never heard of it's story but we are obliged to watch it..since it's essential part is a review of the play..nice prof..  I hate it on the other hand..because...of my classmates. They're kind of different from the other classmates I have in other subjects. It seems very hard to go and have a bond with them. They seem the hard type of people to get along with. But hey...there's nothing I can do anyway..so I'll just live it like that..
