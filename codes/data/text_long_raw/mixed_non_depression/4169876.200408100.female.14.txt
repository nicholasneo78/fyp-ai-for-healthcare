 After  the NDP,we went for our very late dinner....At the stadium there was free face painting, of course i went for the face painting...but i didn't paint on my face lah,i paint on my arm.There was free food but the ice-cream is relly expensive luckily my mum didn.t buy or not she will have to spend lots of money on it. We got 9 free goodie bags but we actually suposse to have 7 only but my mum took 2 extra bags so thats why we have 9 bags but luckily she gave some of tha bags to her friends...I like the FIREWORKS the best during th celebration,i just love fireworks. When walking back to our parking lot at BOON KENG MARKET,there was lots of people i nearly fell on the drain but luckily my sister get hold of me...FUH! We finally reached home at 11pm. It was tiring but all of us were happy..
