 Ok, so I went to bed at 4.48 a.m. Yes, very late. But it's not my fault! The medicine makes me sleep earlier and then I wake up and voila, its that time. So I didn't go to school all week. Oh well, and I should be studying for exams, but if I sit in a chair, I just feel like fainting. Oh, and my mother is a bitch. My computer isn't working and she refuses to call Dell up to fix the problem! Ugh!  Meanwhile, when I EVENTUALLY fall asleep, all I can dream about is my damn Biology exam. Maybe it's telling me that I should actually study. WHO KNOWS!?
