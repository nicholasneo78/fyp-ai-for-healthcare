 This is dedicated to my uncle, who died on duty at the age of 29, doing police work...       The Day I Cried   ------------------------------------            “Those that I fight I do not hate,        Those that I guard I do not love;”  - (An Irish Airman Foresees His Death, W.B. Yeats)      It was all white in the room,    The corpse in his winding sheet,    My aunt in a new white sari,    Staring into the silence where he had gone.    I could hear the leaves rustle outside the window, But I didn’t cry.      She had gone crazy, my mom whispered,    Between her sobs, “She is just 25, the poor girl”    I just continued to look down,    At the mosaic floor, not registering a word.    I could hear the white saris softly flapping, But I couldn’t cry.      My cousin sister came to me,    Dressed in her prettiest frock for the occasion.    She was five, did she understand?    I took her out to buy her chocolate.    I could hear the neighbors’ shushing as we went by, But I still didn’t cry.      On my way back in the train,    Three passengers were discussing the police,    “All corrupt sons of bitches – they deserve to die”    I remembered you, uncle, so proud of your uniform.    I could still hear my aunt screaming as nani lit your pyre, That’s when I cried.    --V.
