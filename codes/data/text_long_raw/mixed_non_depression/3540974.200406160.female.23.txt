 "It's hard for me to say it" thats what he said to me... Darn..what have i done? I shouldn't bring up the matters..but this stupid mouth just slip it out. He sacrifice it for the sake of my relationship. Though i don't know what's in his mind..exactly. I'm gonna miss him.. big time !!I don't know whether he really wants it or just play a around.. Gosh.. can i lie to myself?   I'm so tired being here..  Suppressed by all my childish fear... And if u have to leave..  I wish that u cud just leave.. Cause your presence still lingers here... And it wont leave me alone..  These wounds wont seem to heal This pain is just too real.. There's just so much that time cannot erase.. When you'd cried i'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream i'd fight away all your fears.. i've held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me..  You used to captivate me by  your resonating light  but now i'm bound by the life you left behind your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams your voice it chased away all the sanity in me...  i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone.. and though you're still with me.. i've been alone all along ....................... :"(
