 I took her out it was Friday night.I wore cologne to get the feeling right.we started making out and she took off my pantsbut then I turned on the TV.And that's about the time that she walked away from me.nobody likes you when you're 23 and are still more amused by TV shows.what the hell is a.d.d.?my friends say I should act my age,what's my age again?what's my age again?Then later on, on the drive home.I called her mom from a pay phone.I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail.this state looks down on sodomy.And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me.nobody likes you when you're 23 and are still more amused by prank phone calls.what the hell is caller ID?my friends say I should act my age,what's my age again?what's my age again?And that's about the time she walked away from me.nobody likes you when you're 23 and you still act like you're in Freshman year.what the hell is wrong with me?my friends say I should act my age,what's my age again?what's my age again?That's about the time she broke up with me.no one should take themselves so seriously.with many years ahead to fall in line,why would you wish that on me?I never want to act my age,what's my age again?what's my age again?What's my age again?
