Is my friend a narcisist?
I have this "friend" who I find kinda annoying.
Because of my not so social nature I am used to being the third wheel, but this person, let's call him "Eric", seems to have me as an option.

Now, we met each other due to a drama club where I managed to get myself into a script writing role, he wanted in. Me being an innocent 11 year old at the time, I didn't think much of it.

Now, 17, here are a few factors that lead me to believe the title:

1) I dont care about what other people think of me. Whenever he can he always speaks to his other friends, let's call him "Mark,"

Mark doesn't like conflict and therefore listens to everyone. I am his secondary option.


2) Whenever I do better than him at something he always tries to make himself seem better and that I just got lucky.

He says things like:

"You just used 10 more minutes, so you did worse"

"You always get lower or equal to the mark I get."

3) he tries to get me to adapt to him by saying things like:

"Did you really choose that haircut? Its bad"

Or

"I am dissapointed in you"

And

"We're soul-friends" (trying to make me agree with him)


4) He is always butting into conversations with my other friends, trying to pull me away from them

5) He tries to convince me that I'll do better at life with him rather than anyone else.


Again, I don't take any of this to heart and generally just ignore him, but should I make it clear that I know what hes doing, or am I just being paranoid?
