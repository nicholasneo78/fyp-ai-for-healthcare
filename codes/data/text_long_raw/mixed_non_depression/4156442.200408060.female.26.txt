 Well I don't know what exactly the purpose of this is....but I thought it could be a good way to meet new friends....and express my ideas....don't have nothing expecific to say just dealing with been single and dealing with dating....that is always a headache! new people new problems...the uncomfortable beginning of having to explain to someone your life in one date! and as time pass, finding out all the lies!! men are such liars! but I guess we are too! oh well, I love men and I can't live with out them!!
