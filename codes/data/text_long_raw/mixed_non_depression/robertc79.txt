Is my sons mother justified in demanding I stop trying to give my 17 month old son a high five?
I was recently told that giving him high fives during our last visit resulted in him hitting more than usual. I don't understand how she formed this correlation given there were significant other factors at play. I really need some advice on this one. My family thinks this is just another reason for her to limit and restrict my access to him.
