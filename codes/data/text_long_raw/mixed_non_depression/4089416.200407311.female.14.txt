 When I think about everything you put me through and all the heart break you caused me, I wonder why I ever thought I loved you. And I wish I never knew the real truth.   You made me smile and frown, laugh and cry, you even made me happy when sad. Cheered me up every way, and even yet didnt stay. Why have I gone so far as to find the truth. Now I wonder how I let this pass me by without ever giving a good cry.   You never held me, never kissed me, never showed me how you felt. And yet deep down still always believed you. Until the day I woke up to find it not to be a dream, but all the heart break to be true.   You made me crash, then said so sorry. Broke me once, tiwce then once more again. You shoock me too me never to go back. Playing along with every little song, never thinking or caring how I would get over it.   Heart broekn, heart taken, heart never given back. I hit my head against the wall while I wonder what I ever did wrong to ruin what I thought we had, and about something I know I'll never get back.    I know you messed me up bad, but why do I feel like I'm still getting punished for your mistakes?!
