Friends That Can’t Be Wrong?
So basically; my friend always thinks that I’m mad when I’m not. In turn, he gets mad at me because I’m “mad”. I try to explain as calmly as possible that I’m not mad, which makes him even more mad.

Why does he always convince himself that I’m mad and refuse to understand that I’m not even when I try to explain it?

How can I handle situations like this? He’s a cool dude and all but his mislead belief in thinking I’m mad and refusing to accept that I’m not mad, in turn, makes me mad. It’s so annoying.
