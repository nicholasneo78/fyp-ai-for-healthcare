 Well I'm back, SP2 for windows decided that it didn't like the fact that my PC was functional and swiftly took steps to correct the matter. Long story short, I stumped myself and Microsoft tech support, I couldn't even get past the loading screen, and safe mode wouldn't load. So I had to take it into the shop to get the HDD wiped. I also passed my aptitude and physical test for the Canadian Armed Forces, I'm glad it's over, the physical wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. I'm on vacation for the next two weeks, nice to have sometime off.
