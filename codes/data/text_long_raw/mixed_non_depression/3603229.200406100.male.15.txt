 Started Drivers Ed. again today. I would of already had my permit if I had not gone on vacation to Florida when I was taking the class for school in Feb. but I have to admit, the trip was worth it. On the bright side, I only have to go for 15 more days. July 1st I should have my permit if all goes well. When I got home, sense I'm now offically on summer vacation, I did what I've been wanting to do for a long time, absolutly nothing. I just sat around watching T.V. (of course nothing good was on -_-) but it was a good day. Other than that, I didn't do anything today. Planning to go to my friend Micheal's house tomorrow but he might already have plans, we'll see what happens.
