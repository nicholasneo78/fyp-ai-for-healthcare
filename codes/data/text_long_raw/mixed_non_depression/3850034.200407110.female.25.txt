 Now and then, I would do a crass (if not hilarious) Chinese adaptation of English songs. Some of my prized works include Baa Baa Black Sheep, Do-Re-Mi, and now, "Top of the World". Sing to the tune of the song! The lines don't quite rhyme but hey, the meaning does correspond. Enjoy.   Top Of The World  Such a feeling coming over me There is wonder in most everything I see  Not a cloud in the sky  Got the sun in my eyes  And I won't be surprised if it's a dream I'm on the top of the world  Looking down on creations ï¼Œ  And the only explanation I can find  It's the love that I've found  Eversince you've been around Your love puts me at the top of the world
