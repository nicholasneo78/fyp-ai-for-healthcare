My dad is about to be 65. I'm scared suddenly at the age, and I'm sad because the last few years I wasted and didn't see him enough. He's a very healthy, smart person. Do I still have quality years for us to do activities together?
Wondering if anyone can tell me it's all going to be okay in the sense that 65 is not that old, and that I still have time to make memories and learn from my dad at his age. I'm 26. The concept of him having nothing new to teach me and needing me to take care of him now is truly devastating, because it's hitting me how much time has gone by, and just the idea of me being more capable than my father is a bit scary. He's healthy, smart, independent, wise. He still seems the same as he always did except for being a bit more gray, and you can see the age in his face a bit clearer. He drives himself around, works, volunteers, has a long distance relationship. He just seems to be a bit upset and nervous about the state of my life. Like I'm always complaining and yammering about something and it's hard on him. Yet all he wants to do is help me, so he keeps trying, and every time, he just gets put through the ringer and it's hard on him. I feel so bad because I say very harsh things and he's such a fragile person, trying so hard to be tough in this world. And I know shocking the system when you're old is hard on you. So I'm trying to just be mature, put all of the mess behind me, and ensure evevery time him and I are together now, he can see that I'm all good, grown up, and not going to make everything bad for him again. I just want 65 onwards for him and us to be quality bonding time.
