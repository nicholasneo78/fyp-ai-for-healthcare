 My life as of right now sucks!  I mean, I broke up with Chasen, Brit and David broke up!  I just don't know what is wrong in the universe to make things go wrong all of a sudden!  I have a new boyfriend (Kurtis), and I am not so sure that I like him that much now, but I am not sure what I should do about it! DOES ANYONE HAVE ADVICE?!?!?  I am still in love with Chasen, even though he has moved on, doesn't want to be friends with me at all, and he won't tell me what/how he feels about anything!  I really just don't know what I should do about anything!  Once again, DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY ADVICE?!?!?  And the school I am at now (Cocke County High School, Home of the Fighting Cocks) is okay I guess.  I mean, I meet a new person everyday!  I like my classes. There are some guys that like me and everything, but I don't know who and who not to like!  It is very hard work to be a girl now days!  Any ladies wanna agree??  Especially if someone thinks you look good.  Well, that is about all for now!  I will keep you posted almost everyday!  Talk to yuh later.  Love yuh bye, Crystal!  ::Kisses::
