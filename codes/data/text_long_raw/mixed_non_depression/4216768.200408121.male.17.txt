 Each raindrop not only soddens the ground more, but makes my mood more and more solemn... It gives you time to brood with cold toes and numb hands. A loss for words though, with such a think haze over everything. You walk out side to be speckled with drops of mist. The wind bites your skin in this Pennsylvania August.  Sarah is in the hospital. I am reluctant to visit her. I have more important things to do. Or not. I'm simply proving my strength by rejecting her. I blew off a girl in the hospital. I destroyed Tuesday's visiting hours for her. It just sets in how evil that sounds. I was in the area twice since. Neither time have I visited. It is sweet karma though. Upon her whole family. Her brother is in a sanitarium in Utah, she's in one in Pittsburgh. Ah, the beauty of having copious monies.
