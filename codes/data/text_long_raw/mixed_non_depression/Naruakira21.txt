I feel like I get disrespected sometimes by my mom and brother.
I [21f] live at home with my parents [58m&amp;52f] and my older brother [25m]. Every time I'm in the bathroom emptying my bladder and my mom has to go, and she rushes me to finish. It's not like I can't pee any faster, I swear my mom and brother are the only ones in the house who can be rude to me sometimes. When my brother plays his game and I want to tell him about something he gives me an attitude just because he's mad at the game since he sucks at video games (I don't know why he keeps playing the same game that he dies in a lot) or he just plains ignore. I think now I  know why I was never happy living at home. A lot of bad things happened to me in the house I grew up in. (it's a long story for another post).I'm more happier away from home than when I'm at home. The only time I feel like I get respected and treated nicely is when I'm with my boyfriend, my best friends, and my other family members. Sadly I can't move out yet since I'm not working at the moment but I'll be working soon and making enough to leave the place I can't even call home most of the time.
