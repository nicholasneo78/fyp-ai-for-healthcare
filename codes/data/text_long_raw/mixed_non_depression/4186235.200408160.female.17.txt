 You say hello, inside I'm screaming I love you You say goodnight, in my mind I'm sleeping next to you. You drive away from my car crash of a heart And I don't know... But you gave me the best mixtape I have And even all the bad songs ain't so bad I just wish there was so much more than that, about me and you.. You talk to him, and it burns me like the sun You talk to her, and you say that you feel Like he's the one I talk to me, but you can't hear the pain I Feel, you don't know.. 'Cause you gave me the best mixtape I have And even all the sad songs ain't so sad I only wish that there was more than That, about me and you.. Oh, don't turn around and say bye again Yeah it crushes my head when you call me Your friend and I'm not the same person From back in the day in the back of the Class that you thought was gay No I can't find the words 'cause I lost them The minute they fell out my mouth And it's love and I'm in it, so give me your Lips and just let me kiss 'em and let's Get messed up and listen to possibly.. The best mixtape I have And even all the bad songs ain't so bad I just wish there was so much more than That, about me and you --Mixtape, Butch Walker  WELL, I'm eating some Rice Krispies...yummers. And I be leaving for the lake in about an hour..so...I'll be back on Thursday sometime and then at Folkfest on Friday and Saturday..yaaaaaaaaay...okay, yes..bye..
