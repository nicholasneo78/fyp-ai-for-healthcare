Sexual Harassment Problem on me
Me and my friend are together for like 5 years and after graduation he choose to work with me at the same company. In our company, we have to travel a lot because of our marketing campaign and such. In one business trip, my friend touch a girl co-worker "below" part. After the trip, things are changing very fast. The victim girl feel ashamed and tell the boss. All of co-worker girls block me and my friend on social media. 

I'm building my reputation for like 4 years and It's just that gone into the wind because of my friend mistake. Of course, I trust my friend, he is a good guy but how the girls even block and treat me like sexual rapist. I don't even know what to do right now! 

FYI, 

(1) Guys in the company and our general manager trust me. 
(2) My friend got fired
(3) I also planning to leave company because of that happen.
