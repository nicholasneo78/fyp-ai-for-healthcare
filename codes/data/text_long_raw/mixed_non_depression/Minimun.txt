How can i connect with my sister?
We live in different worlds.
She's two years older than me. We've always been close, but never on a deep level.

When we were kids, we often played. 
In school, she was sporty and popular. I was bullied and quite. 

In her teens, she began following the mainstream, wearing the latest fashion. Always wearing makeup and black n white clothing. She craves luxury, but she's not bitchy. She's kind and generous. 

I like alternative styles. I love spiritually, and science of developing a healthy and peaceful mind. I don't have a need to be like everyone else. I LIKE to be childish.

It's so hard to connect to her since we're so different. 

Any tips or methods to bring us closer?
