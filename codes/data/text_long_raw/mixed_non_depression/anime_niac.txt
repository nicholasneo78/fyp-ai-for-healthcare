My best friend of 11 years got engaged and I wasn’t invited.
So, I just don’t know how to feel it’s not her fault that I wasn’t invited or told about it. Her fiancé didn’t bother to call us (my other best friend and I). He had his family, her family, his best friends, and their amway business partners(that’s a whole other hot mess). But anyway, I  was working and got a phone call from an old friend and asked me how excited i was that my best friend was getting engaged. I replied “I had no idea.” She just said, “Oh..” I’m so hurt. But I don’t really think her man cares. He doesn’t like me and our other friend for reasons unknown to me. Now I’m asking myself will I even be invited to the wedding? Because I doubt I’ll be a bridesmaid. Idk I feel crazy for being hurt but. I’ve known this girl since I was 16 and I’ve know her man for 6 years. Why wouldn’t you even let us know that you were going to do this?? A text would’ve sufficed.. *sigh* really trying not to dwell on this but it really makes me hurt inside.
