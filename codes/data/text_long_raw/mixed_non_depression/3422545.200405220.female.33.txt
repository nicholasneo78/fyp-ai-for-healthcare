 What a whirlwind! My first trip since I've decided to try travel writing. I got a few articles started: one on dogs in Paris and another on a single woman's trip to paris (that would be me). You can see pictures from my trip and about the people I met at  urlLink www.lisabanks.com/Paris/Paris1.htm .  I'm still recovering. I caught a cold on the way back. The worst kind of souvenir. But this week I've had 3 new inquiries from my website, so work is still clipping along...
