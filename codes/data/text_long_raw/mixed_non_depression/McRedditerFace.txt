When should you receive photos of your childhood?
Hey all,

My mother has all my childhood photos and memories locked up in her closet, along with those of my late father and his family, most of whom are long gone.

I'm 37, married, father of 2... I'm just realizing the absurdity of this.  The other day she offered to exchange one box of photos for another "favor" she wanted, which seemed rather hollow to me.  These are my photos, right?

The way she's currently handling it is that I'll only get these photos once she's dead... That could be up to 20 years or more, she's 76 currently.  

What makes this even more poignantly absurd is that I nearly died 2 years ago, the emergency surgery only had about 50% odds of survival.

What is she gaining by this?  Is this normal?  

Thanks
