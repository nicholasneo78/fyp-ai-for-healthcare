It's not like I don't wanna hangout with them
I think I'm becoming a bit anti-social. So, I just got a job and my days off are always all over the place. When I finally DO get a day off, my friends instantly call me up and ask if I wanna hang out... the thing is, I just wanna relax. So, I always either say no to them or make up some excuse.

It's not like I don't wanna hangout with them, but fuck sake I'm tired and I wanna enjoy my day off on my own. And that's probably not the best thing, I think it's me developing an anti-social attitude.
