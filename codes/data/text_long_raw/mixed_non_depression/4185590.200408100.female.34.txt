 The HRM at my store is such a dipshit!  I'm taking a leave of absence (FMLA) and he tells me he needs me to come in and "meet" with him.  If I wanted to come in at his whim - then I wouldn't need the LEAVE OF ABSENCE!!! I'm not on the clock - I'm on a leave... He is so stupid and doesn't understand ANY labor laws. In other news, hubby and I are going to go to an auction to try and buy a house.  There is going to be an open house this Sunday so that we can see the inside of the house ~ I can't wait to see how it looks!  If things work out, we might be able to get this 3br/2ba house on over 5 acres for less than .... well, let's just hope that we can be the highest bidder..
