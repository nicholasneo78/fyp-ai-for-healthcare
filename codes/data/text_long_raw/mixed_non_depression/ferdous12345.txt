I haven't spoken to my siblings in years
I'm 19, and I haven't spoken to my sister and brother in literal years. They live overseas and haven't visited since I was 10. It's not bad emotions or anything, not at all. I just don't call or text and neither do they. I didn't grow up with them, so my other siblings (who live here and I talk to regularly) know them better. I feel left out. I don't want them to think I don't care about them.

I feel so bad all the time about it. I know I can just reach out, but I feel awkward doing it. I've tried FB messenger but they don't use it a lot, so now I'm trying to get their WhatsApp info.

How should I reach out again? I know this is a weird situation.
