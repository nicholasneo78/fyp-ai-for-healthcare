Options for helping my sister in law
Initially I wrote out a very long post with all the problems my SIL is dealing with but it really all comes down to this question:

With my 13 y.o. sister in law living in really terrible conditions (think 1 step above homelessness compounded by emotional abuse from parents and bullying at school), are there any options for my wife and I to effectively 'adopt' her for an extended period of time? Do we have *any* course of action that would give us rights to house her over her divorced parents?
