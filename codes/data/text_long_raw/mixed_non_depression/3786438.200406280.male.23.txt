 the month --june the day 29th... the hour...(not yet) ladies and gentlemen i invite you all to the biggest success story of all times....Errrr or maybe not as big,but big enough to let my 6ft 3inch body frame seem pulverised, into as small a case as a case study.My wheatish comlexion seems to have improved not because of any bodily improvement but because of the dying signs of radiance...as they say radiance is brightest from a candle only when its almost exhausted. no never, i did not (right now iam knoding my head from left to right at the speed of light) expect a business school to be sooooooooo gruelling. PHEW! PHEW! PHEW!...oh sorry but those are the only sounds which i can expropriate out of my self...I CHOKE! CHOKE!.....to be contd....
