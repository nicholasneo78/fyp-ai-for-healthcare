 Well, I have so much to say and so little time in which to say it. I'm going to have lots of cool stuff on here, just you wait. All my opinions on stuff and my innovative fashion ideas and my rants and reviews of current fashions... then I'll tell you a thing or two about what it's like to live in Indiana... the most conservative place on earth I fear... and all my fears and opinions about politics.  Then somewhere in the middle of it all... I'll tell you about my life.  Maybe it will come out as part of the other two subjects, or maybe I'll just feel like ranting. But check back now and again and stay posted to my crazy world and all my opinions thereof. By the way, I work in a mental hospital and I have fascinating stories about my early Christian school experiences...  stay tuned! ;-)   Lily
