 Tonight was a momentous night. Apologies to Kelly Holmes, but while she was achieving her dream of olympic gold my mind was elsewhere. At just about the same time my daughter Ellie took three teetering first steps and our house errupted in a state ot total euphoria. In the seconds following the great event Ellie lost her focus and tumbled towards the ground, only to be swept up in a bear hug and given another chance. We weren't disappointed that Ellie only managed three steps, or even that she fell. Her triumphant grin and clapping hands were enough to melt the coldest of hearts. I can't help but wonder if God ever feels the same way about me. Maybe sometimes I focus too much on the end result and not enough on the joy of having a God who is there when I throw myself on Him in an attempt to do something I could never do without Him. I think next time something doesn't go my way I might try to take a leaf out of Ellie's book. Perhaps I'll clap my hands, grin triumphantly and try again, realising that a little progress can be a pretty big deal. And to Kelly Holmes mother..... I think I know how you feel!!!
