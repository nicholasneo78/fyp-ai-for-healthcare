Coursemate [19F] wants me [18F] to find potential housemates, has high demands but i’m doing all the work :/
So at uni it’s time for students to be looking for a house to rent for the next academic year. Usually people live with friends they’ve made and such or just go on facebook and join groups. 

The place we’re interested in is a 6 bedroom house, I personally wouldn’t mind an all female house or with 2 boys and 4 girls idc. But my coursemate said she’d prefer 3 girls and 3 boys. Well so far we have 4 confirmed girls (me, coursemate and a girl that SHE found), i’m currently getting enquiries from girls and a few guys but if i’m doing this on a first come first served basis, it’s looking to be an all girls house.

She made me look for the house, call the agent, book an appointment, put an ad on facebook.... She said that she has some anxieties doing some of this which i guess i  can understand bc sometimes i have bouts of social anxiety that i can’t help so i am a little sympathetic... But she’s being very demanding, i couldn’t look at any houses over the weekend bc i was with my boyfriends meeting his parents and his family so i couldn’t drop all that and go on my laptop doing all of this !!

If i tell her that it’s looking to be an all female house with maybe one guy, i’m a little scared to know her reaction... But then again, she’s made me do all this work and yet would have to audacity to complain ?! 

I feel like she has a certain demographic in her head of what kind of boys she’d like in the house (she’s a lesbian so it’s not like that) ... idk ... 

I’m not sure what to do or say... shall i accept the girls that are actually willing to pay and be proactive or decline their offers JUST because my mate “wants boys”🙄?

**TLDR** friend and i need to look for a house with other ppl for next year, she’s making me do ALL the work, is demanding and wants some boys to live with us. Only girls have been seriously enquiring... how do i tell mate ?
