 Just last night I was watching the news and the headlines said that the man who was running the government in Iraq is dead. Assassinated by a bomb. Someone said to me after hearing that 'Well, Iraq's not going to go away in a hurry!' I want it to go away and leave me to my life.  You've gotta wonder what goes through the head of someone just before their car explodes.
