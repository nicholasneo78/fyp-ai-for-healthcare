 So this is a good idea. There is so much going on in my life...yes, a way to keep track of it is good. Maybe I'll get motivated...we'll see .            So let's start with "The Diet"...     I started about 6 weeks ago. (I think, I can't remember really.) The start weight was 255, and I made a goal of losing 100 pounds. Ok, so we'll count this as week Six......down to 233. Total lost: 22 pounds.
