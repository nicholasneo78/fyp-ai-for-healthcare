My step brother came out to me while drinking and I'm not sure if he remembers
A few days ago we were pretty drunk, he more drunk than I, and he told me he sometimes finds men more attractive than women. He said he had never told anyone else that. I was very supportive and told him I was proud of him, but I'm not sure if he remembers having this conversation. He made sure to say multiple times that this is something he would want to talk about sober, but I'm worried that might have just been the alcohol talking. The topic hasn't come up since. I'm not sure if I should bring it up. I don't want to embarrass him or force him to come back out if he doesn't remember it, but I also am worried that he may remember it and be to embarrassed to bring it up himself. I just want him to know that I still love and accept him without making him feel awkward or pressured in any way. Can anyone help me out here?

tldr: step brother/best friend came out to me possibly black out, not sure if I should bring it up or not
