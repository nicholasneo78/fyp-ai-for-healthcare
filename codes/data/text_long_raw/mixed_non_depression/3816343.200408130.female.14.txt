 it is so annoying b-ing me. at least evry1 else my age has one good thing in there life. bayfriends. to be perfectly honest i have had only one boyfriendin my lifetime. and even that only lasted 2 hours. i know i said that i've had more but i lied. mostly b-cause sandra and them were making fun of me cause of it. what is true tho is evrything else. and if ne of my friends read this ever im srry for lying its just the rest of u are so lucky cause unlike me u guys can easily get a boyfriend or a friend for that matter. out of all of us i was the only one that evry1 hated. while u guys are girlfriend matterial and friend worthy, i remaain here being as steph put it "the friends friend." thats y i think i may move to my dads if he'll let me. i dont want to be the friends friend anymore. that's what i was in orillia, barrie and even coldwater. im sick of people saying "youre ashleys stepsister" or yeah youre britt's friend."or "alexs friend" or whoever's. i just wanna be me. maybe if i was me to begin with maybe alex G. would be into me or maybe i wouldn't be known by most orillians as little dion."
