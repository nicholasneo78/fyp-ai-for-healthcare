Why was this guy sooo weird?
I was talking to this very weird guy online. He seemed normal at first but he quickly became very weird. He had a very weird instagram that was filled with memes and weird facts. He also said that apples were more affective at waking you up than coffee. 

He also randomly announced that he was at my school. We hung out, it was very weird. He was complaining about missing a bus most of the time and the cold. He also only wanted to talk about school. When we were texting he would respond with one word answers and never wanted to talk about anything. He didnt have any favorite tv shows and he didnt listen to music.

He was also antipot and was very judgey of people who smoked it. He only hung out with people who got good grades. 

He was just very boring and complainey. He also never drank. He was also condescending.
