 i never knew i could get so sun burned!!!!!! on Saturday I went to Martinez to sum park, they had a pool there so me and all my buddieswent swimming, the week b4 (3rd of July) i had gone to a lake and got sun burned, so on saturday when i went swimming i got extra dark. my shoulders are peeling now and i look like i got some skin disease or sumthing, i HATE BANANA BOAT!!!!! that crap doesn't work!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh!!!! yesterday was so weird!!!! I went to Stonestown with my sis and cuzin, we were in line at Panda Express, and all of a sudden sum phillipino guy comes up to me and he says "i know you! i know you from sumwhere!" at this point i was scared i thought he was going to kill me or sumthing! but then he was like "don't you go to Jefferson?" and i was like "yea" and he was like don't you remember me?!"(he sounded kinda psycho when he said it) and hopnestly i didn't remember him, but he wouldn't leave untill i said i remembered him, so i finally said " oh yea! i remember you, you were in my class" and he started talking for like 5 minutes, then i finally, was like "i got to go eat i'll c you around" it was weird cuz he didn't leave untill i said i knew him.
