Where did I go wrong?
Let me apologize by the rather lengthy post:

I’m not sure where to start. Recently, I’ve been having trouble with my friends and I’m not sure why. I had a childhood friend since Elementary school, we would hang out often and now she’s a stranger. She would say she was busy, but the last day I texted her, my dad had kidney surgery because he had cancer in his kidney. They removed the whole kidney and the day he got home, I texted my childhood friend that he was home and he was doing okay. She couldn’t even take one second to respond “I’m glad your dad is okay?” That was it for me, I had to remove her on Facebook after she had to replied after a week, two weeks, etc. and I believe I deleted all messages on my cell phone, and I’m not sure what happened ! Then this “friend” of mine, never messages me on either Instagram  or Facebook. I think it began when I told her I asked out one of her friends a year ago (we are still friends, the girl I asked out), and from then she started not to respond to me. So, recently I told my friend who I asked out, about the communication between me and her friend. She told me that her friend, (who is also her roommate)  that they’re both extremely busy, which I understand, but and that “she” loves me, and doesn’t hate me (my friend who doesn’t respond, and not love in a boyfriend way.) But, if this is the case why doesn’t she communicate with me online? Even when I see her, she waved hi to me and we talk a bit, but it’s not the same. There were times in the past where she use to hug me a lot, any time she saw me. But something has changed with her and me, I can tell. I think my friend (the girl I asked out), is unaware of my “friend’s” (her roommates) , true feelings toward me, and I mean that in a bad way. I’m just not sure where I went wrong....
