 Hmm. I'm Really Not Sure If I'm Ready For Highschool. Not That I Have A Choice. I'm Sort Of Forced Into It. I'm Actually More Afraid Of My Grades Than Anything Else. I Mean, They're Not That Important, Right? They Just Control The Rest Of Your Life, Like Wether You Become A Scientist, A Doctor, A Drug Dealer, A Bum, Or Even Worse, Someone Who Works At Mc. Donalds. I Think The Only Way I'm Going To Last All Four Years Is Not Taking Crap From Teachers, Not Getting Beat Up, Taking EVERY Non-Athletic Extra-Curricular Activity They Offer, Bury Myself In Schoolwork And My Wiccan Duties, And Not Leave Myself Any Time To Get Upset About How Screwed Up My Life Is. I Hope My Friends Will Be Reliable Through My Highschool Years, Unlike Current Times, And Help Me Say, "HEY LIFE, YEAH, I'M TALKING TO YOU! FUCK YOU! YOU HEAR ME? FUCK YOU!Recently It Just Seems Like Everyone And Everything Is Out To Piss Me Off. The People Who I Like Are Impossible To Get A Hold Of, As I Have No Means Of Contact, And I'm Getting Scared About Everyone Around Me Doing Drugs And Drinking, And Talking About Nothing More Than Sex, And If Not Sex, Than Suicide. Talk About A Trade-Up. Oh Yeah, Something Good Happened Yesterday. I Won 3 Fish At The Fouth Of July Carnival (on the 2 of july)
