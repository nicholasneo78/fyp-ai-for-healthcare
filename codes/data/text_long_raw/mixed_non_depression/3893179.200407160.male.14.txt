 Well, sorry for not posting. Instead of telling about myself, I'll just update my profile. Learn about me there. --- Pretty uneventful week, except for yesterday. I got a haircut and saw Spider-Man 2. THAT MOVIE IS FREAKING AWESOME!!! If I had the time, I would have seen it again. But I am moving in about 2 weeks and I have tons of stuff to pack still. That and I am broke. I am owed $140 and have not gotten it yet. I thought I would have gotten it sooner so I spent all my money and now I have about $2 on me. Oh well, I might get the money this weekend. We shall see.   That's pretty much it for now. I will post again when it is convenient.
