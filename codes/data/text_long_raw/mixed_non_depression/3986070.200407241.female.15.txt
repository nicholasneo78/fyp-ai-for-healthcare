 ! If you love someone let them go.  If they return they were always yours.  If they don't you never were.       ! Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without,  And know we cannot live within.       ! Looking back I have this to regret...  too often when I loved I didn't say so.       ! Love sometimes can be magic...  but magic can sometimes just be an illusion.      !    If you love someone let them go.  If they return they were always yours.  If they don't they never were.
