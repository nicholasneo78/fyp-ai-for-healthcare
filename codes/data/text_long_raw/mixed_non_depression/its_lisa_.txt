Friend problems
So my school is a small school so in my class there’s only 10-12 people. I currently have a friends let’s call them Monica and natalie. I hang out with them but, I’m always the  second one. By second one, I mean like a second choice. When one of them isn’t at school or aren’t with them, they’ll come to me. It’s a problem when I have to get a pair for class activities like in PE. I had a friend who I thought she could be my real friend. I’ll call her hailey. I one told her a secret and she spoiled it to the whole school. I still gave her a chance. She started being really harsh on me and what I like which is photography. She would always insult me and say negative things that makes me think negative. I realized that we didn’t really go well and that our interests are very different. So We kinda stopped hanging out often. I tried my best to be funny and social. My friendship between my friends (Natalie and Monica)  were getting better but I was still the one that they didn’t really care. Now hailey is trying so hard to be friends with Monica, Natalie and maybe me. Natalie knows that she’s trying to “be like us” but Monica doesn’t. Monica is slowly hanging out with hailey. Hailey started to ask me what I like to wear and all the small stuff. And she also wouldn’t stop talking about my crush and his best friend. Which is uncomfortable for me. her personality changed and I realized she is actually trying to be like my friends.  I currently don’t know who should I be friend with since I don’t have a best friend. It’s quite embarrassing when I have to get a pair because I have no one. I don’t know what to do.
