 Okay... If i wrote about my situations w/my ex, i would have a huge fucking post, so I've decided not to write about boys at all. It's been FUCKIN' MADNESS!!!!   So.... um.....  uh.... let's see... It's FRIDAY!  Yay!!!!  This weekend is the Apalachin Fireman's Field Days.  Tonight i'll be taking my daughter to watch the fireworks.  Tomorrow i'll be taking her to my aunt's to watch the parade go up the street and go to the Field Days to ride rides and stuff.  That's exciting.   Yesterday i went to one of those Adult Bookstores all by myself!  How creepy.  It was like me and 10 hairy greasy icky men.  I bought a lovely blue "personal massager" w/a dolphin on it to give my clitoris the special attention that it deserves.  I took it up to the guy to pay for it and he was like "I have to test it", so of course, i giggled b/c i thought he was joking.  It turns out he was serious... i guess they have a "no refund, no return" policy (which makes sense), so he had to take it out of the box and put batteries in it and make sure it worked AND IT DIDN'T!!!  So i had to go get another one!!!  It was very awkward, but the guy was really cool about it.    Other than that, i guess i have no news. Ta ta.
