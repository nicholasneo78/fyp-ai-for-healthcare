 I really don't want a blog, but Kendra is MAKING me one so I guess I should write SOMETHING for it. I hate blogs. I think they're dumb and pointless and no one ever wants to read them. I mean, seriously, most people don't want to sit there and read about what someone else did all day long. So why would you be interested in what I've been doing? So my blog is going to be unusual, hopefully somewhat interesting. Talk to y'all later!!  Peace out, A-town!   -Chel
