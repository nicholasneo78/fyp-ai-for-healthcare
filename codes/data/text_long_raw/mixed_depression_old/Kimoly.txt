My thoughts are ruining my relationships
Hey,

First of all: I don't know if I have depression, but people often told me I seem depressed. I've never spoken with a therapist about it. 

I just felt like this is the right subreddit cuz I hope you guys understand me. I normally have PMS but right now it's just 80% worse than usual. Maybe that's also part of the problem.

I'm in my first relationship ever. It took us a long time to get together. Now instead of being happy I feel... numb? Or scared. I'm fucking afraid to ruin everything. I'm constantly overthinking things, doubting my feelings, thinking my bf is better off without me. I'm just so confused. Where are all my happy thoughts? The main problem is that some people out there tell me that my feelings aren't enough to be in a relationship with him. Sounds more like we're best friends. I don't feel any spark/butterflies, I don't get nervous around him. I like him very very much, can't imagine being without him. It just feels familiar to be with him. I dreamt of having sex with him... I'm normally a very distant, shy person due to the way i was brought up so hugs and all that stuff are things I'm not used to. I've even wondered if I'm asexual. 

Any advice? Do you also think this relationship is wrong? My thoughts are killing me. I feel horrible. :( I really want this to work out. 

TLDR: First relationship, doubting everything because of what other people say, feeling horrible/depressed :(
