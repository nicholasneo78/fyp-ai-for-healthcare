Kill myself because I don't have a girlfriend
I've been a shut in for about 2 and a half years now. Everyday I stray further from God's light. I'm really embarrassed to show my face to anyone who's not my family, I really want to buy a mask for when I go outside, that way no one can look at my shame.

I'm turning 19 soon, and I've never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and I'm probably going to die alone. I'm not fat or anything, i'm just a skinny guy by nature, I understand that If I want a girlfriend, I should work on myself but I just can't live with the fact that I wasted my youth being a shut in. The shame is unbearable, I want to erase any evidence of my existence, my punishment for failure will be death by hanging, this is my last resort. Death over defeat.
