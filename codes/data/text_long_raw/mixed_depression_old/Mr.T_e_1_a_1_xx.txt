I'm brand-new here at these forums. I've come to you all to seek guidance/wisdom from any of you who has suffered or is currently suffering from depression. Within the past 3 years I have struggled on and off with this disease. For the most part I've had it under control, until relatively recently. About four months ago I was drastically descending downwards mental health wise. The result of this declination helped obstruct all aspects of my social life, causing an abrupt, painful end to many friendships I endeared. Also my negative behavior started to poison. The equilibrium that my family and I shared. The result of all this lead not only to my choice of isolation , but even if I chose not to isolate myself, I still had damaged relationships so much, that any attempts to make amends, and or repair former friendships, were futile. I basically pushed and alienated myself from everything I held dearest. Anyways, one day I just snapped; my ability to process information, perform simple math equations, remember things I had JUST thought of seconds before, concentrate, quick wit, and confident decision making had all been impaired immensely. Previously, before all of this, I was an "A" Honor Role student and had no difficulty functioning efficiently in my "AP" classes, but now I can barely sustain a low "B" average. Has anyone experienced this lack of cognition? If so, do you know if it will go away? Its driving me insane!
