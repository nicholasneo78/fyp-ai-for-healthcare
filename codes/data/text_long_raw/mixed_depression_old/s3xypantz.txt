I dont want to kill myself. I just don't want to exist
I dont want to exist. I dont want to deal with all these emotions. I hate myself. I know people around me would no doubt benefit with me gone. I dont want to kill myself. It would just be another giant cost to my family who doesn't have much money to begin with. I'm an accident. Nobody wants a fifth kid in their 40s. I wasn't meant to exist so why am I here? If I wasn't here maybe my parents could've bought a house instead of renting their whole life. Maybe buy a car that the bumper doesn't fall off on. Maybe they could have enough money to retire soon. I just wish I didn't have to exist to be a burden on everyone
