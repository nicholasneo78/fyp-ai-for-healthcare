To start off I have had depression quite consistently since I have started college at 18. I am now 22 and my depression was getting pretty bad again, then I met this girl about 4 months ago. We started dating and it turned out we and tons of similar interests and very similar morals. A few days after we started dating she told me that she was going to australia to study abroad for 10 months, weeks later she told me she was afraid to lose me I told her we would worry about it when the time comes. Since then we have had some really great times doing things we both love together. Yesterday we finally had the discussion of what was going to happen when she left. In my mind I was hopeful that we could maintain this relationship despite the obvious obstacles. I told her I cared about her more than anyone I have ever dated and said that I wish we had a chance together. She told me she doesn't believe in long distance relationships, this kind of broke my heart but at the same time I knew it was the logical choice in this situation. She told me that she did not want to cut me out of her life and that she wanted to stay in contact with me. She also said that if it was meant to be that it will happen for us. My family has been very hesitant about our relationship because they worry about me spiraling downward when she leaves. I am a little worried about myself as well, today I cried on the way to school and during my break between classes. She leaves in 6 days and she still wants to see me as much as possible before she leaves. I am so afraid to lose her and scared of how I will feel when she is gone. Please help.
