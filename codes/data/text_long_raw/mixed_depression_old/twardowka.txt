I don’t know what I’m doing anymore
I feel empty, I feel bored, I feel depressed and I just want to sleep but even the thought of sleeping while there’s so much going on outside this house makes me anxious.
Tomorrow I have another test and I’m skipping school again. I already skipped today because I was too lazy to start studying before Sunday and of course I didn’t know shit, so instead of taking responsibility I just skipped school. And I’m skipping again tomorrow because I studied even less for this test.
My grandpa, the father of my mother, is risking death in an hospital bed. My mother is with him in the hospital everyday and every night to keep him company in his last moments of his life and she cries everyday. It hurts me so see her suffering so much. And it hurts me to see my grandpa in such critical conditions. I feel like they’re both miserable but I don’t know how to help.
I wanna hang out with my friends to get rid of all these bad thoughts but I don’t have many, and if I ask them right now they’ll just answer “sorry, we can’t hang out, we have to study”. Which is true, I know it is because I should study, too. But I don’t. I just spend my days staying at home, listening to music and crying because I’m a pathetic piece of shit.
I hate my life. There’s so much monotony in everything. I wanna try new things. I wanna make new friends. I wanna visit new places. I wanna become a new person. But I don’t know how to do it.

Sorry for this mess... English is not my first language.
