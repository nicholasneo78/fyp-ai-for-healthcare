So here is my situation .. I want to go to University .. Problems: I don't have a cent to my name, parents will not give their ok on the issue and I haven't had a job in over a year and there are no prospects in the near future. I could go behind their backs and apply for a loan but I would just feel a lot better knowing they were ok with it all, I don't want money from them. Some meaningless minimum wage job is not going to make me feel good, if anything it will make me feel worse about myself. I have not accomplished a single thing in my life and feel this is pretty much the last straw to do something meaningful, but day after day there is another block and I have no means of getting around it, I'm 100% dependant on my parents (who are usually the blocks) and I hate it. This isn't something I want, its something I need..
