I can't do this anymore. I can't keep telling myself I'm happy. I can't keep ignoring the pain! The constant pain...it won't go away...always there, a sharp knife in my heart. Day in and day out it hurts, whether I'm happy or not, it hurts. I can't do this anymore. All I want is for the pain to end...just end! I have nothing. Not a friend in the entire world who cares. Do you know what it's like to have no friends? Not one at all who can be there for me. I've got nothing to stand on anymore, nothing to cling to. I've got no reason to live left in me. I don't even have religion anymore. Christian, Buddhist...I'm not either, I'm nothing...I have no faith in afterlife, I just want to die. I can't keep living like this...I can't keep living. I am nothing...I have lost all hope, I have nothing but despair...nothing but constant pain, constant fear, constant hurt. I can't go on like this, even physical pain is better than this. How does one who is so fully dead inside...still be too afraid to die...yet want death to come so badly. Who does not care whether he goes to Heaven or Hell or nowhere at all.
