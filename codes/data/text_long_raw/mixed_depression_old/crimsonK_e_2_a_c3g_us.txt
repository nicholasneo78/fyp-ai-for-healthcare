i feel like i keep sinking lower and lower into this depression, and i can't get out from under it.  i keep feeling worse, day by day, i am drifting downwards further into the darkness.  maybe i'm just having a tougher time of it lately, maybe i really am getting sicker, i don't know.  all i do know is how i feel, and i feel like giving up.  i don't want to do anything anymore, i have no desire to do or want a single thing.  i can't live like this.  i just want out, to stop feeling so lethargic and so severely depressed.  It's getting to me a lot more i guess, but i just don't want to be like this anymore.  It's taking me over and swallowing me whole, and i feel like letting it win.
