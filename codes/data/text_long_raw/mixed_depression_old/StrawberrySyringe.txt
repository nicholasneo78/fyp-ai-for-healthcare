Today is my 21st birthday. I'm spending it alone with a bottle of wine.
Birthdays have always been a bit of a sore spot for me. To quote a very old comment of mine, 

"13th birthday: I had just been let out of a mental hospital a few days before. My mother finds out she has a brain tumor. My only friend at the time gets sick and goes home early.

14th birthday: All my friends but one bail on me. My parents scream at each other until my mother packs up and leaves.

16th birthday: My family and I go out to dinner to a restaurant that my dad chose solely because he had a coupon for it and buys the world's smallest birthday cake. Halfway through my birthday celebration the following weekend my friends abandon me due some drama bullshit that was apparently more important than me.

17th birthday : Dad starts an argument in the middle of a restaurant in front of my best friend. After we get home, the argument continues, resulting in my dad physically attacking my mother. All while my friend and I sat in my bedroom."

To add to that, my friend's mother died of a heart attack on my 18th birthday, and I spent my 20th alone due to the fact that all of my old high school friends had moved on and my best friend had decided to join the military. Well, today was my 21st. My best and only friend completely forgot about me. My dad then made me have an emotional meltdown. Now it is nearly midnight and my only company is the nearly empty bottle of wine sitting next to me, so I am not only sad, but also slightly drunk. Happy birthday to me.
