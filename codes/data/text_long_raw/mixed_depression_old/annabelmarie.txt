My life is so hollow
Stupid self pitying rant, sorry.
Nobody cares about my existence.  I’ve never been and can’t get into a relationship. I’m stuck in this isolated suburb for the next 3 years of my life, drifting between my school and home. Usually I can occupy my mind with focusing on my looks or dreaming of the beautiful life i’m going to have once i’m free, but recently i’ve been having to do more school work (i’m used to just stumbling through school without really focusing and getting above average grades but recently i’ve been having to actually work to compete with my peers) and I either reject it to stay in my dream world or get 10 minutes in and break down because it gives me time to realise how hollow my life is. Nothing feels authentic when i’m here. There have been beautiful times in my life and 90% of them are when i’ve been abroad. I just feel so genuinely empty whenever I give myself chance to look around and realise how isolated I am from people and the world. And as a person who truly appreciates the beauty of human beings and life, this really hurts me.
