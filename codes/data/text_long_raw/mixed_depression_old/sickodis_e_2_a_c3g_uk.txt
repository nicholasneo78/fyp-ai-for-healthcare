Oh my god.  I am THE most irritating person to be with recently.  It's just cry cry  cry.  Silly little things start me off then it just goes into the big list of reasons as to why  deep down I hate myself.  Then it goes into, you are ungrateful so ungrateful and a wimp a big stupid wimp an ungrateful selfish attention seeking wimp (go into the happy place go into the happy place, the nice view - wouldn't it be easy to jump from this nice view - find another happy place - stuff the happy place grab your teddy and go to sleep) you don't deserve to be alive you don't deserve this great boyfriend when all you do is pick petty little arguments and cry all the time at silly things (go to sleep you're tiring yourself out).  Then when i'm tired out i'll stop crying, then a few minutes later i'll sob then i'll get tired from that too and i'll brainwash myself with rubbish television.

rrgrrrrrrr i cant stand this.  this is slushy moany person i hate.  i'm turning into someone i hate.  i have been for ages.  i'm losing control.  i'm losing control.  "it's not the end of the world they say" well mine's crumbling away and it's all my fault and every time i get back into putting things right something knocks me down and every time things seem ok BANG! there it goes again streams of tears spurted from absolutely nothing.  what a blooming fool!

excuse all this craziness this has been my 1st really bad spell since i joined this site about a month ago just as my last one was becoming ok.
