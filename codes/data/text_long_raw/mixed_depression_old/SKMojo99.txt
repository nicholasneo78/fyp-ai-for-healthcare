The Irony of Loneliness in an Overpopulated World
As I spend more time in the presence of depression, I've tried to apply a further focus to understand what's actually going on in my head. Dealing with the sudden appearance of depression has been a nightmare and a half to deal with to say the least. So in response, I regularly attempt to interpret the spiral of self loathing thoughts and whirlwind of emotions that march throughout my mind. 

My initial reaction to a diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempts has been to run away from everything that reeks of painful memories, both theoretically and literally:

* I write this post 7,000 kilometres from my home country, in Japan, where I aim to live for the next couple of years. 
* ‎I've ghosted those whom I use to call my close friends.
* I left all social media in order to avoid contacting people that I knew, and because looking at how happy other people were brought me down. 
* ‎I changed my image drastically over the past year as an outward expression of the fact that I'm trying to change as a person.

It's here in Japan that I've come to a terrifying realisation. I can't run from depression. Here I am, in a country where people speak a totally different language and immersed in a totally different culture to my own, writing a post about depression. 

Recently, I was walking the streets in search for job opportunities when I sunk into a depressed mood and began thinking about my place in the world (which always turns out well). Nothing actually matters. We work in order to pay rent, in order to stay in the same place, so that we can reliably keep a job so that we can pay rent. It's in this meaninglessness that humans as social beings look to others for comfort. Our lives are but a meaningless speck in an expanding universe. That's quite the depressing thought... And it is. But why is it that when another body's lying on top of mine, or when I'm held in a warm embrace, this thought doesn't have any impact on me?

I've done quite a bit of thinking by myself,  and have talked to a bunch of people from back in the psychiatric ward on what 'fixes' us. And the unfortunate answer for most of us is... Nothing. We can't be fixed. It's just how our minds work. But what if we don't have to be fixed? The hardest part about depression for me, is the intensity of the loneliness I feel. When I'm at my worst, I'm so focused on my own loneliness and the meaninglessness of my relationships, that the few connections I do have, I dismiss. Now, this isn't the case for all people suffering from depression. For a lot of people, their negative emotions are driven by a sense of worthlessness,  meaninglessness or sadness. 

But the general consensus is, although we can't 'fix' ourselves, we can have people around us to support us when we're at our lowest. And it makes sense that as social beings, human intimacy provides us with a safety net for when depression's hitting us the hardest. 

Unfortunately for most of us, the type of physical and emotional intimacy that we strive for is unobtainable. In my life, depression's caused me to push away the people that I've spent time building connections with, and has limited the amount of contact I've had with strangers and people that I COULD connect with.

I think it's ironic. It's ironic that in such an overpopulated world, depression is such a big issue. We're the people that need intimacy the most, so you'd think we'd be in a position where intimacy is more readily available. But that's not how the world works. Our lives are still meaningless. We still hate ourselves. And we're still alone.
