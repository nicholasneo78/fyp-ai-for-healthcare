I don’t want to die feeling like I was never loved
47M married to 41F.  We have no intimate life. I feel like this is the life I was given.  

I don’t want to die having forever thoughts of not feeling wanted   

I have never experienced affection, adoration or intimacy.

Yes we have made love (3 times in 2017)   But it’s all me.

I have never had manual play (handjob)
I have never had oral on me (blowjob)
I have never been lustfully fucked, only starfish. 

I do everything and anything to make her feel wanted.  

One time, before I die, want to feel this.
