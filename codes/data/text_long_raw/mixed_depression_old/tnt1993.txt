I can’t decided if I’ve been managing or avoiding my mind and feelings...
How is everyone today? For the past two months, I haven’t had a depressive/anxiety episode even though the problems are in the back of my head everyday I wake up. It triggers my anxiety a little because I’m anticipating another one of my relapses. It’s been weeks since I’ve cried or have been stuck in bed (which is good compared to what I’m like usually). But I still don’t feel too inclined to reach out to other people or hang out with them. I don’t feel like dealing with people’s criticisms or judgements of me. I’m just not open to it still...other than that I just feel indifferent/‘Meh’. But is that a good thing? Or should I zip my lips and stop thinking about it :/ some perspective would be nice.
