I AM LOOKING FOR ADVISE ON MY MEDICATIONS BEFORE I CALL MY DOCTOR BACK AND SHE THINKS I AM DRUG SEEKING. OK, I HAD BEEN ON WELLBUTRIN FOR 1 1/2 YEARS, I FORGET THE DOSES, BUT I THEN WAS PUT ON EFFXOR DUE TO MY PERSISTANT DEPRESSION. I WAS NOT FEELING ANY EFFECTS FROM THE WELLBURTIN SO WE QUIT TAKING THAT AND MY DOCTOR PUT ME ON ADDERALL!!! BECAUSE MY DEPRESSION WAS A LOT BETTER AND WE THEN WERE GOING TO WORK ON THE ADD. WELL I HAD TAKEN THAT FOR 3 MONTHS AND I HATED EVERY DAY OF IT. I WANTED TO TAKE IT BECAUSE WELL SEVERAL REASONS AND I KNOW NOW THAT I DONT WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT EVER AGAIN!!! WOW !!! BUT NOW WITHOUT THE ADDERALL OR THE WELLBUTRIN I CAN NOT GET MOVING, I AM TIRED EVERYDAY ALL DAY, I SLEEP ALL THE TIME, CAN NOT GET ANYTHING DONE, I HAVE NO MOTIVATION. I AM NOT DEPRESSED BUT I CANT GET UP EITHER. DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY ADIVSE FOR ME? I WANT TO CALL HER IN A FEW DAYS BUT I AM SCARED & NERVOIS. I AM NOT DUE BACK IN HER OFFICE TILL LIKE MAY SOMETHING & I CAN'T GO THAT LONG, I HAVE SUFFERED ENOUGH FOR ONE PERSON (30 YEARS) BUT  I AM NOT BRAVE  ENOUGH TO CALL HER WITHOUT SOME SOLID INFORMATION ON MY PART. I HOPE SOMEONE CAN HELP ME. I WANT TO BE NORMAL AND WELL. I WANT TO HAVE A WONDERFUL SUMMER WITH MY DAUGHTERS BEFORE THEY GROW UP AND ARE ,,,, GROWN!!!
