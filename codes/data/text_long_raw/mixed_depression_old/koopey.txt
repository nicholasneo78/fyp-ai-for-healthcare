I don't know what to do anymore.
I really don't know what to do anymore. It's just too hard. I try to be positive and act like nothing is bothering me but that doesn't help at all. Everyone says it's supposed to get easier, but it doesn't. 

I've tried reaching out a couple times to talk to someone about it but they really don't want anything to do with me. I don't blame them though, it's not their fault nor are they obligated in any way to be friends with me.

I feel like I'm becoming a bigger burden on those around me. I think I'm just not built for this world. I understand not everyone is, but I'm starting to come to terms with it and I'm getting really close... real close.

I don't know how to cope with any of this and I'm just going to stop trying to. If it happens, it happens. No big deal in the grand scheme of things.
