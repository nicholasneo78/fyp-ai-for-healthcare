The base is 3 bound boxes of Remerol tablets (similar to Effexor). Above that is my trusty 300 mg slow release wellbutrin. Next, Sonata for occasional use; and then onto concerta per my request. Finally there is Risperdal and Topemax - a headache medication.

I tried to kill myself last spring and came very, very close. This event has opened up spiritual dimensions more terrible than I thought possible. Forgive me for sounding weird, but with my life just one little hop, one small step away from obliteration, the return back became a long journey. And most of me didn't even make it back - after the attempt I was hospitalized on a ward with a sociopath as my neighbor. I was naive and even befriended him. Far too late in the relationship I realized that this person may not have my best interests in hand. So I left the hospital but I left beaten. Then I went home to my family and some of them reacted terribly against my illness. I felt powerless, like I was spreading some miserable disease. My struggle goes on but at least I am alive. I believe in many things I never used to now, and that gives me hope.

To anyone reading this, I just hope you won't toy with your life. Live a long one, it's important you do.
