Getting all excited to do something and then canceling at the last moment, for no reason (or: How to Let Down Six Online Acquaintances With One Easy Trick)
Last week I set up an online gaming event that was supposed to take place today. It didn't get a whole lot of interest relative to the other things on the forum, but I happened to have scheduled it very close to another event without realizing, so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯, whatcha gonna do. Either way it was enough interest to follow through with it, so fast forward to today...

...When I had to write a very apologetic post four minutes before it was due to start, deflecting to some bullshit like "personal stress + shitty time management." And just like that, I had disappointed everyone involved.

Idk, it doesn't sound like much when it's written down, but it's been a while since I've done a last minute cancellation quite that bad, and I've just been left feeling really guilty about the whole thing.
