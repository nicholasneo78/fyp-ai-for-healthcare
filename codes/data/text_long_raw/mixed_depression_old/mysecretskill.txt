Can’t get a job.
My patient is about to die. I’ll be out of a job. Can’t seem to get any hospital to hire me as a CNA even though I’m qualified. Had an interview cancelled on me. Can’t vent to my boyfriend or my mom. They make me feel worse and argue with me because apparently I’m just too negative and I’m not allowed to be sad. 
The depression is getting bad again despite heading into spring and warm temps in Arizona. 
Can’t keep doing this. The black clouds over me have been here my whole life. I’m sick of it. Just want to end it all. Fuck this life.
