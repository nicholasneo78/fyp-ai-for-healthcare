What are you amazing at?
Seriously? And, I don't want to hear no bullshit like, "driving people away", or things like that. I am trying to promote self-esteem and value in your own eyes. So take this opportunity to brag about yourself. Just try to keep it positive. I want you to reflect on what makes you a champion. Because, make no mistake.... We are all Champions!
