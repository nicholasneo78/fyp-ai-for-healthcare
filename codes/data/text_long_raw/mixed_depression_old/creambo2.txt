You ever get scared that you’re not depressed?
I’ve been going to a therapist for about a half a year now, and I just got diagnosed with Depression a couple of weeks ago. I’ve recently told my parents that I got diagnosed (I’m a teenager.) and they just said that I’m going through average teenage feelings.

This really lead to me questioning myself, I told my therapist and he said that I am depressed but I still feel like shit.
