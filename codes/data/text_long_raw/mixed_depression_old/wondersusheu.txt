Nothing.
I have come to a point where I can't do anything. I just drown in my own misery and problems. I tend to overanalyze things. And that hurts my brain. I feel like a failure. That's what I wanted to say. I really want to write more, explain my feelings in full detail, I just don't have the energy. Not even for that.
