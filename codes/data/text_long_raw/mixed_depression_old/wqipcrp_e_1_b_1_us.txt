I take it that by you saying "Learn to give rather than take and you will find life turns around!" that you're implying that I'm a taker and not a giver. And maybe that's so. Maybe all the blood that I've donated (it gives me a sense of purpose and sometimes it seems that the nurses there are the only ones who care that I'm alive, and that's only because of what my body produces) or the times when I do things out of the kindness of my heart rather than for monetary gains or as a means to earn someone's favor or to make them somehow indebted to me like others would do, maybe doing all that still means that I'm a taker. I don't know. I've been told that my perceptions can't really be trusted, but that doesn't sound like someone who's a taker to me. I'm 27. And by that age most guys have been in at least one relationship. I haven't. That's why I've set the timeframe. Everyone I know has had at least a taste of love and human companionship by the time they were 30. So I've decided that if no one wants me, why stay? Living alone means seeing what I want on TV....and having absolutely no one to enjoy or discuss it with. That's my view of it. Pessimistic? Yes, but it's been the truth for me. I'm sorry to sound bitter, but this is exactly what I face out in the world. People see my problems and think that it's my fault. I hoped I'd get a different attitude here.
