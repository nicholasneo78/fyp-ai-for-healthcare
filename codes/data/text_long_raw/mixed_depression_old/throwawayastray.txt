When I lie in bed, I look forward to living in the dream world inside of my head. There, I am the person I’ve always wanted to be. I’m loved, safe, and happy. But when morning comes and I wake up, reality sinks in like a brick. My youth is gone and I’m still a failure, and I wish I never woke up.
I have tried so hard through most of my life to feel accomplished, to live a life I can be proud of. To love and be loved. But every day is another act of failure and rejection. The days get heavier and heavier. I’ve run out of strength. I want to stay in my bed. I want to stay in my dream world. 

I really, really don’t want to wake up.
