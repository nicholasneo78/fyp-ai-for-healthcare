I'm not good at anything
I used to draw good but now i've gotten worse at it for some reason. I have no idea how life works, i suck at socializing and keeping up relationships. Even if i invest 300 hours in a game i am still below average at it.

The fact that i am constantly tired and have 0 energy doesn't help me much either. No matter what i do i am never more than average at it.
