is anyone out there...
22 year old black male. NY.
around so many people i feel like a lost soul. &amp; it don’t seem like anyone understands me. so i still feel... different... i started typing about my childhood but that’s a story in itself so i’ll keep it to my more recent years. suicide.. it’s growing on me everyday. just for the simple fact that i think myself into this mood where i think everyone’s life would be easier without me around. not to toot my own horn but i’m pretty popular, so i know people would be affected by it for a couple days but who really CARES enough to actually help my mind get to a better place? i’ve seen it happen plenty of times in this place i call home. i have had the same friends for 10+ years, very authentic friends but i feel we’re outgrowing each other.. youngest kid to a very loving hard working single mother of 3 but i always felt like the odd child.. &amp; currently in a 2 year relationship with a girl anyone would want.. (i recently started blaming her for cheating from thinking too much) but yet, i don’t feel not even half complete. i shut down &amp; don’t talk to those who mean most to me to the point where they think i have a problem with them... &amp; i don’t know how to control it. i was never able to talk to a counselor or mentor cause i never felt real love from them. but sometimes i think i just need a open ear i can vent to without everyone else knowing about it. that seems to never happen though. not to sound like a hippy, loll but i live my life off of vibes, if you know what i mean.. &amp; as of late i don’t even know what a vibe is. i just want to be left alone to think. recently deleted all social media accounts, just isolating myself from my surroundings.. i feel like everything is coming to an end soon. idk. i just need that push. i don’t want to be a waste of life when it’s all said &amp; done.
