I don’t even want to write this post
I just wish I had the fulfilling family experience like everyone of my other friends did. But instead I got a drug addict mom and a emotional incompetent dad who I regularly got into emotional skirmishes a lot when I was younger. Im the product of verbal abuse and emotional neglect and it haunts to every single day of my life. This affects me in ways like not being productive at all when I get close to deadlines, not being to emotionally relate to anyone because my internet sense of judgement and risk management are fucked up, I have self destructive tendencies that I use as coping mechanisms, I hop on the rollercoaster of life and hope and pray sometimes that it would fling me off the tracks. I don’t even know if any of this makes sense because of the conflicting thoughts I’m always having about whether or not I believe or don’t believe that this life is worth living. I’m trying every single day, I’m trying my hardest to keep it together, I’m trying my absolute fucking hardest to keep moving forward but I am consistently being stopped or held back by the dread and anguish of waking up to a life that I don’t even want to fucking live.
