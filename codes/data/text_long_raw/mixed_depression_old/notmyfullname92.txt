I Saw Someone Jump Today
I was driving over the main bridge in my city this afternoon. This bridge has been used before. I was driving downtown and I noticed someone on the opposite side of the railing. My girlfriend was in the passenger seat and before I could say anything to her. They were gone. I didn't get to see their face and if I did I think it would've destroyed me. I crossed the bridge, pulled over and called the police. I wish I could've helped, yelled something, gotten out of my car. I don't know. I didn't even know her but I feel as though I've lost someone close.

I struggle with depression myself and I just wish I could've talked to her, I know we could've related on some level. That almost excites me, getting to relate to someone, even over something sad, to just feel that. Thanks for listening.
