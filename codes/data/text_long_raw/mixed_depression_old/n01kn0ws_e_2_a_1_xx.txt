Hi. My name is Jenna. I'm 20 years old and just joined and figured that I should introduce myself. I found this site from searching online and think that it's great. I only started accepting the fact that I've been depressed last year because I've always been very good at hiding it from everyone else and I used to fool myself as well (if that makes sense). I've never been one to seek help from others because in the past I've always dealt with everything myself. The start of college and being outside (different state) of my home environment (which is the cause of a lot of anger and resentment that I also have) helped me to see that there was something wrong with the way that I was living and that I could reach out and get help. I'm currently seeing a counselor (through my college and since I feel like I'm working well with her that I don't need to seek other outside help yet) about my anxiety and depression but I feel that talking to others that are going through the same thing could help give me a different view on everything and be helpful as well. I'm glad that I stumbled across these forums and I can't wait to get to know some of you. Jenna
