Hi all, I'm new to this forum and am in desperate need for help and advice as I've nowhere else to turn. I'll start at the beginning. I feel that I'm under a lot of stress with my job and the pressures of life. I feel that stress and depression go hand in hand. I'm not sure if I am stressed and depressed or if I have something medically wrong with me. That's where I need advice on what are common symptoms of depression and stress. At first I thought I was anemic as I am pale and don't eat a lot of meat so thought that my dizziness was down to lack of iron in the system. I also get eye strain but put that down to working on computers as a living. I have had blood tests for anemia, diabetes, blood sugar levels and other general tests which all came back fine. I have changed my diet and exercise more. At the moment I suffer from dizziness, eye strain, headaches, lack of concentration, irritability, lethargic and lack of co-ordination. If I'm honest I'm s***ting (Not sure if I can say that) myself as I don't understand what is wrong with me. I have a loving girlfriend and no money problems and a good social life but a stressful (if that's a word) job. Do the symptoms sound like depression and stress related or am I in the wrong ballpark here. Any help is really appreciated
