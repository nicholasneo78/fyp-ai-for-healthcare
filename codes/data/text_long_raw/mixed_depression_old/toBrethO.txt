Got rejected again today.
I have had this massive crush on this girl for a while now and we been getting along really well. I was suprised to find out we had quite a bit in common and I felt so giddy every time I talked to her. I decided today I would suprise her with an early Valentine's Day gift and maybe she would like it. Nothing huge, I got her favorite snack and a brief note telling her how I felt. I don't know what I was expecting but she read it the note and walked away with the gift. She texted me a few minutes later she was nervous to reject me because she knew I was afraid and she would like to stay friends. I can't blame her for how she feels, it's her choice. Although, I feel utterly defeated. I have never been on a date or been kissed, or in any relationship with someone. I thought maybe this would be it, but I was wrong. On top of all the other shit going on in my life, I don't see a good reason to continue this fruitless struggle to survive.
