I have had depression for at least 5 years now. I have been with my partner for 2 years and in that time i have come to depend on him for a lot of things - everyday things like making phone calls for me etc. because i find it too hard. In the last couple of months, friends / family have seen him out with another girl, they were closer than they should've been, i have also seen it with my own eyes. Since i have noticed this, our relationship has deteriorated a lot, to the point that we are fighting every weekend, and during the week because he is always wanting to go to his friends house (who is this girl's brother). Today, he has been really angry and agro at me. He has told me to go away and that he has been avoiding me on purpose. I feel like if we broke up my life would be ruined. I feel like i need him to survive. Every time we have come close to breaking up, it ends up me begging him not to leave. We live together which makes things harder. I have no friends left because i was so dependant on him and they got sick of me not seeing them. It's easy to say break up with him, but if you understood how attached i am you would know its not so easy. I don't know what to do. I think he is cheating on me but i need him ... does anyone have any advice? I am lost ... I don't know what to do anymore.
