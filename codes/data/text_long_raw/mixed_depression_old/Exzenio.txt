I Could Use Some Support Right Now
Yesterday my best friend of five years attempted to kill their self. I'm currently being blown away by school (grad school if it really matters). I don't know what to think at all. This is midterm week and most my profs are understanding but the one class I'm worried about the prof gave me the option of writing and being stuck with whatever mark I get or not writing and the weight being shifted onto my final but I need the feedback to decide if I'm going to even stay in the course because it's incredibly difficult. It just feels like nothing is going my way currently and it's so hard to study or focus. side note; another prof let me write as  told them (like I did the other) that I wanted it as a distraction and said that if I did bad they'd shift the weight to my final.
