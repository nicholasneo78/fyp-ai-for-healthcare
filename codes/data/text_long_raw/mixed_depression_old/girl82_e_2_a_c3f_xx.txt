ok, so today i had another freak out. I woke up feeling good ... it was supposed to be my first therapy session (which i and my boyfriend were happy about) and then after this i was supposed to meet up with my boyfriend for lunch, check my test marks, and then go to the library with my boyfriend to study. These plans changed...

When i walked into the therapy office, they said no appointment was scheduled. All of a sudden i felt really rejected, not worthy of an appointment (like they gave it to someone else), anxious, sick to my stomach, a little dizzy. I've been waiting since February for this appointment! I couldn't deal with my anger properly or the fact that my plans for therapy were ruined today. I started stuttering kind of i kind of got all dazed out and really sick when the receptionist wanted to schedule another appointment. So, it's tomorrow at 9am ... 9am!!! What bastards.

Anyway, so because i got all weird ... i didn't want to be around people. I called my boyfriend ... couldn't get a hold of him. I cancelled .... didn't check my marks, didn't go to the library, or lunch or see my boyfriend. I left. I told my boyfriend i had bad anxiety.

So, now he wants a "break."

And I've been in my room since i got home (since about 1pm) .... feeling really low and weird and lightheaded ....

I've been rocking a lot too on my rocking chair ... it's a weird compulsive soothing mechanism i have. Don't ask.

I'm mad at my boyfriend because he decided to take a break when i needed him most. Is this cold or what?! At the same time i understand: he wants his "brain clear" for exam studying.

Whatever. I guess it's hard being with a depressed, neurotic girl. No one wants to be with a depressed girl. Let's not kid ourselves here.
