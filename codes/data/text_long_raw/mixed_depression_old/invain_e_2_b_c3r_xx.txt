I am new to this so  I don't really know where to start so hopefully if  I stumble a little you will help me out. I am the mother of 4 beautiful children ranging in age from 10 - 10 months, I have a good job, a loving supportive husband and several very good friends .... and  I am once again in relapse, and on medication. I don't know why I thought that  I was ok. Maybe because  I had been drug free in my treatment for the last 2 1/2 yrs, or because things didn't seem so chaotic this time before someone noticed  I was  "different"? There was NO one thing  I could determine that triggered me this time and it's worse now than it was the last time. I am hoping that perhaps some of you might be able to assist me in understanding what happened,  because quite frankly I thought  I would be ok after the last treatment I had ... and it was all in vain
