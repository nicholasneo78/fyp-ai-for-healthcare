I just feel tired of everything
I always feel so tired of doing any work or any other form of interaction. I'm tired of school, I'm tired of feeling inadequate compared to my friends who are moving on to bigger and better things, I'm tired of feeling like a disappointment to my family, and I'm tired of the shitty life I feel like I have. Yet the thing I'm most tired of is being unable to find any consistent motivation in my life, never truly feeling motivated to do or finish anything, just letting any and everything just pass me by. 

It makes me hate myself even more thinking about all the things I could do if I could just find some motivation or will to be better.
