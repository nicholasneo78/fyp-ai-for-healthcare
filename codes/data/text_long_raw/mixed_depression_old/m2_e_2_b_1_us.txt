I'm losing my mind and don't know where to put it for safe keeping. If only I could just put it in a little box, wait for the insanity to subside and then take it out and it would be unharmed. Lately I feel as though I've been more crazy than usual. I can't stand human contact, not just from my wife, but from anyone, a handshake, a hug, anything. I just tense up and can't breathe. What the **** is wrong with me? Yet I lay in bed wanting her to hold me, but when she does, I can't breath, it has nothing to do with how she is cuddling up against me, it's just how I start to feel. I hate feeling like this because it makes her feel like she is less than desirable or that she did something wrong. She didn't. I still love her. I need her. I'd be dead w/o her that's for sure. The good doctor is on vacation this week, I may leave her a message about this latest 'issue' just because I know myself. I won't bring it up next time I see her and then it will continue to bother me. It's like I need to go in w/ a list pinned on my shirt of things I'd really like to talk about. Because I get there and I can't speak. And I hate the awkwardness of sitting there, staring into someone's eyes, knowing there are things you should be saying but you can't. I'll get over it. I always do. That's my motto and I'm believing it less and less lately. Oh well. Monday will be here in 10 min and I need to go to bed. See you tomorrow.
