I’ve lost all my real life friends and all most of my online friends due to depression and i honestly don’t know if it’s even worth it anymore.
I’ve lost my real life friends due to moving and changing schools and just not talking to any of them anymore because i just can’t. Online friends are gone because i’m too much of a burden to everyone and they just eventually leave me. Only person i can call friend is another person i’ve known for 2 years off of Borderlands 2 and he’s going through the exact same thing. Im so fucking lonely and just tired of not having energy to make new ones. I hate life 

Edit: Thanks for all the kind words ❤️ I’m glad i’m not alone.
