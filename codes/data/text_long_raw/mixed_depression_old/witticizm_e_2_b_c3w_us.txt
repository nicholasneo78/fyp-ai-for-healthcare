I'm new to this board. I've been on State Disability for severe depression since March. Sometime during the summer - can't remember exactly when - I was sent for a psychiatric evaluation. Even though I told the doctor I was still suicidal, sleeping 18 hours or not at all, bulimic, and in danger of eviction because I couldn't manage running a household, she determined I was well enough to go back to work. I have been under psychiatric care for depression for about 12 years now. This is NOT going away. I have been trying to finish my Social Security application since March but it's too overwhelming. I should have it ready this week. Does anyone have any experience with appeals at the state (California) level? Btw, I did lose my apartment and had to send my son to live in Texas with my mother since I was on the verge of homelessness. I spend all day paralyzed with fear. Help.
