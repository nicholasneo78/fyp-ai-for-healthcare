My bottom line concern is that I'm suddenly afraid of men. When a man speaks to me in public I'm suspicious of his intentions, and when a man was openly flirting with me two days ago I left the store and then became afraid that he might follow me home and had to go sleep with my 4 year old in his room with the door locked that night. I'm even nervous and suspicious of men I've known, like spouses of friends.
Background. My husband is in the military and has been deployed. He's been gone since September and since the beginning I've had a fear of being in the house alone at night and it has progressed to this. I'm a fairly sane person for the most part. I dealt with some PPD when our son was born and my OBGYN gave me Xanax which was NO GOOD. My PCP put me on Lexapro which worked out just fine and I weaned off of it about a year and a half ago. I know this behavior is abnormal, but I can't seem to stop it. Can I have a little push in the right direction??
