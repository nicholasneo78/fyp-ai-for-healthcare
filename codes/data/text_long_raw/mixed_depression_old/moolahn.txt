How to deal with people who can't seem to be bothered with you?
Question is fairly self-explanatory. 

I ask this because recently (within the past 6 or so months), my supposed 'friends' have started to become quite distant with me and it's making me feel like total crap. They rarely ever contact me despite me having reached out a couple of times. It's all very fragmented. What hurts the most is I see them interacting with their other friends (on facebook etc.) and also that they have been online recently but still have not answered my messages. My friends used to be great, they used to consider me their closest friend and would reply quickly etc. But now I feel like I have been replaced and I have nobody left. Even back when I'd hang out with them, they'd be on their phone talking to these other friends of theirs and I feel so hurt. 

Being alone sucks. No matter what, I can never seem to make friends with anyone new. The majority of other people my age are living it up, but I can't seem to do anything with anyone apart from my family. I feel like I'm missing out on something.

I feel so unwanted to the point I've started deleting all my social media to isolate myself even more. It's beginning to eat away at me and my depression is coming back, as much as I hate to admit it.

I do not know whether to take this opportunity to improve myself and pursue my own hobbies and basically just do things on my own, or attempt to reconnect with my friends/actively seek out people who will appreciate me.

ANyone have any advice to get me out of this rut and to feel less shit about wasting my youth ? Words of wisdom? Previous similar experiences etc?
