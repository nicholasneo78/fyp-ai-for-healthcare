Dead is better than alive imo.
I wouldn’t say I feel particularly sad or depressed, as a constant state. It’s all over the place. But I think I do want to die. I choose to believe there’s nothing after we die; no afterlife, no heaven or hell, no reincarnation, or godly ascension. Just a beautiful, peaceful nothing. And it just seems so much better than being alive. 

When you’re alive, you feel so much. Yes, there’s happiness, excitement, surprise, love. But there’s also sadness, anger, hate, jealousy. Why would I chose to bare such things when death can provide none of these things? All the “good stuff” about living doesn’t weigh out the bad, in my head. A nothingness after death just seems like the better, more rational option. Am I wrong to think this?
