I'd just like to thank you all i am comforted to know I'm not the only one who feels like this

I'm 24 and until october last year i had it all a great job a fabulous fiancee ( awful future in laws) but you cant have everything and we had harry the dog but then it all changed i had an eptopic pregnancy that i think started it all my future in laws said it was only ibs and they were at the hospital with me and kept making me drink hot water then my mom went in to hospital with severe liver failure when i walked in the hospital she was bright yellow something i have never seen before think ten times worse than george best she has got severe brain damage and doesn't know who she is most of the time . we have been told she has not got long left so i spend most of my time there but its killing me i just don't know how I'm going to cope when she goes and to top it all my now ex fiancee dumped me because I'm not spending enough time with her and taken the dog i just feel like I've lost or about to lose everything i have ever loved

i went to my doctors yesterday and begged them to help me so they have given me cita things but they say that you can get a bit worse before i get better and i don't know how much more i can take

sorry for going on but that's me
