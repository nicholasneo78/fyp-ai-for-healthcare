I noticed people who talk to me, sometimes just walk away mid conversation
I'm socially awkward and I have a hard time reading cues about where the person wants to take the conversation. Is he genuine with me right now, am I interesting enough? I end up expressing myself in bizarre ways and people just up and leave. I find it incredibly rude almost like I'm a crazy person and they think it's okay to disrespect me. It hurts a lot
