Well I'm 13 so please excuse my grammar and spelling. Well it started almost about... 1.3 yr ago. I started to get large mood swings and would end up being sad or feeling guilty nearly everyday. That's when i discovered cutting myself. It started off as what does it feel like then grew into and addiction. I used to be doing it nearly everyday. IT made/makes me feel like there's nothing wrong. Well this grew bigger and bigger and i didn't tell anyone about it. After about 8 months i started to lie to myself and say everything was fine, It worked. Only temporarily. Around 3 months ago the feelings came back and i still have them at this moment. I have researched a lot about clinical depression. I still cut and i hate it. I came right out to my parents and said ''Maybe i enjoy cutting myself" when we were in a huge fight. My dad turned around and said "we don't care if you cut yourself". This definitely didn't help. So right now i have one person i can talk to about it and has a good friend of mine. I checked the symptoms of clinical depression on Answers.com and i have 12/13 of them. I need to go see a doctor i know but i just can't. There's something stopping me and i don't know what it is. I just want to solve it on my own but i can't. I need Help. I have also been thinking about committing suicide and doing drugs but my friends that know i cut are stopping me. I know i will be missed. I just can't live on anymore... I can't see myself living past 18. Can anyone relate to this? Can anyone help?
