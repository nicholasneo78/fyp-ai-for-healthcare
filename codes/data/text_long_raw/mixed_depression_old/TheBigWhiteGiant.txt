Consequences of being hospitalized?
What are the legal ramifications of being hospitalized? I’m sure it goes on some kind of record somewhere but like where and who can see it? Employers? Do I lose any rights? I shoot targets for fun a lot, it’s one of my few hobbies, but if I’m hospitalized do I lose my right to own a gun? Any other things that happen that I’m not aware of? I’ve been suicidal all week lied to my dr about it because I’m afraid to be hospitalized. But it’s getting bad, I have a hard time thinking about anything else. Help please!
