i don't really  know what I'm doing here but i think i better get this out because it's driving me crazy and i really need to do something and stop thinking!

is it normal to be reaching out? i think that in the past looking back, i have tried to reach out and every time it just got screwed up. i feel stupid but i think it's like i need to know that someone knows that I'm in pain. is that rrlike normal?

the first time i wrote a letter to friends, school found it and called my guardian. i then was forced to a doctor who i lied to and ran away from as if nothing ever happened.
next it was an email, school found out, school counselor persuaded principal for her to deal with it. went to another doctor and ran away from it once more.
now I've left school, no school counselor anymore with shit still going on and me still not dealing well with it. since then i have spent so much money on credit where i started to message wrong numbers 'accidentally' - how lame is that?! i still talk to one lady that replied who also suffers depression. one night it went too far and i ended up being taken to hospital because of what i wrote ... and now I'm here.

do you think that this stupid reaching out will stop if i go to a doctor or counselor? is this what my problem is, that i need to know someone knows I'm in pain? why do i feel like this?

anyone?
