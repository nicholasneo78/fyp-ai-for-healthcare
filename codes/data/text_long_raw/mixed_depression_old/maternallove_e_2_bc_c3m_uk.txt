There is a genetic weakness in my family - virtually everyone has been on medications at some time, or is on medications now, for depression and anxiety disorders. It seems to onset around puberty. I have had a truly horrible time over the last 3 years supporting my depressed daughter (now aged 15) and, more recently, my 22 year old son. I have been taking 340 mg of St John's Wort once a day for about a year, but I am aware that the genes are kicking in, and I am now quite ill in my own right. I really don't want to take prescription medications, as I have seen the horrible side effects that my daughter and son have experienced as the medications have kicked in - she has had to change medications once as she reacted so badly. Just from looking at the size of the St John's Wort pills available, it is obvious that I could take a much higher dose. Does anyone know anything about dosage, and whether it would be better to take doses throughout the day rather than just once?

Incidentally, Valerian Root is great for sleeplessness - if you can stand the smell!
