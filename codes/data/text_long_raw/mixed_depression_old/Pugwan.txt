Spending Valentine’s Day alone... when I shouldn’t be.
Over the weekend, I told a girl who i thought liked me too about how I felt about her and I asked if she wanted to go to dinner on Valentine’s Day. I thought it’d be a nice thing... her and I are very similar, we don’t have great social skills, we both write for our schools newspaper and other crap. Her response was nice, but I feel like I totally fucked up with a beautiful girl. I’ve never really had anything with a girl and I’m 21 years old. So, I guess I’m alone tmrw when I could’ve asked the girl if she just wanted to hang out. Just being in her presence is so fun, but now I feel so much negative tension between us. 

Fuck.
