Reddit isn't a nice place for someone who suffers depression.
I think it's funny how sometimes we take internet so seriously. I have no idea why the rudness of some totally strange person, probably between 12-16, made me so... down.

I think it's because I use Reddit a lot as someway of just... Keep my mind full, away from my problems and feelings. So when someone makes you feel something, it's like a hit of reality.

Escapism isn't that great, and I'm so tired of feeling bad all the time.
