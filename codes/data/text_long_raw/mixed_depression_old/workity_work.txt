My best friend’s husband shot himself friday night. I’m angry.
He was a manly man. All of us. All of his friends encouraged him to get help but he grew up in a world, in a house, that thought mental health professionals were quacks. He thought that taking medicine for something going on in your head was weak. This was an entirely medical problem that could have been prevented. So I’m mad. At him for leaving my best friend a 26 year old widow, at the people who raised him, at society, for telling him it’s weak to take medicine, at whatever the fuck higher power may be responsible for this stupid, senseless waste. I’m guilty for not trying to do more. I’m heartbroken that I’ll never talk to him again or hear him play his guitar or see him turn a piece of wood into something beautiful. I’m confused by the events leading up to it. 


I just need help. I don’t know what to do. I’m spending most of my time with my best friend and trying to be strong and give comfort where I can. I don’t know what the point of this post is. Any words of wisdom, advice, thoughts, stories would be very welcome. Thanks for reading.
