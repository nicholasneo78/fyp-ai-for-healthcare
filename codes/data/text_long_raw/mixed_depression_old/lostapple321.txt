going through life waiting for it all to end soon
i got nothing going for me in my life. im 22 and never had a girlfriend. you know what, i never even had a friend..guy or girl. im tired of going to college and doing meaningless work and for what? so i can join the rat race? i dont want to grow old, it's only going to get worse as i age, especially healthwise. im totally awkward, can't make conversation beause there's nothing interesting about me,and im really ugly..so that means no one would even bother taking an interest in me and approach me to really talk.  like that would be one of the major reasons why i never even had a friend, not to mention a girlfriend! and im poor, so i dress stupid.  it's the same thing every single day, i go to school, don't talk to anyone, and go home. i dont even have a job, and i dont drive. i just hope i go away soon, like get a terminal illness, that would make everything so much easier. i don't know, i'm just rambling here. i can't really describe everything in words here, you would have to be in my shoes to really get it, so to speak.
