Even hate eating
I can’t even eat anymore everything tastes like shit to me don’t like doing anything don’t want to go anywhere don’t trust anyone hate being alone but it’s the only way I know to stay away from all the BS.  What’s the point of living such a meaningless worthless life???? 

Also I think I’m losing my mind I catch myself doing weird things and sit there like wtf did i just do that for 

And sometimes if I am walking late at night  I sometimes think hopefully someone comes up and shoots me or stabs me and this nightmare will be over
