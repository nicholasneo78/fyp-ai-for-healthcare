My doctor diagnosed me with depression (mild form) possibly situational. I have been off work for the past month as a result of a culmination of stressful events over the past year or so. Such as my husband's alcoholism, having a child (she is 18 months now) and returning to work. My doctor put me on Effexor 37.5 mg which has since increased to 75 mg. As a result I have had insomnia for past three weeks, I will try to take it before bedtime now as I was taking it in the morning, but I can sleep during the day but not at night??? My Supervisor did not want me returning to work while experiencing side effects ... the insomnia, nausea, dizziness, etc. I applied for short term disability and received a letter today stating I am not eligible for benefits based on diagnosis of depression and being put on medication!!!! Talk about depressing!!! oh, wait, I already was I have very low motivation, I don't feel like socializing or talking to anyone and some days I don't even want to go out of the house. I have to get up everyday though as I have to care for my daughter while husband works, even when I was working it was still me caring for our daughter and doing everything else around the house ... yes, I am resentful too. I have no thoughts of self harm or suicide, just very negative and unhappy all the time. I have found that the Effexor has made me more relaxed , less anxious and less irritable. But the insomnia is horrible, I was having interrupted sleep before being put on medication and really wanted something that would help me sleep ... rrhmmm. Is anyone else on Effexor and find it beneficial for them. Just wanted to introduce myself and hear from others.
