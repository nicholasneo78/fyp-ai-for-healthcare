I really don't know what to do. I have no reason to be sad but I am. It seems like more and more I want to cry. I have a boyfriend and a loving mother but I still cry myself to sleep at night. I go to church and I'm not good in school but for the most part I enjoy going. Please help. I don't know what to do. My mom says I have mood swings and I've noticed that I can go from laughing one second to crying the next. I'm 15 and I just really need someone to explain how I'm feeling to me.
