I was sexually, physically, and emotionally abused by my father, my uncle and my grandparents from the time I was five until I was fifteen. My mother had taken my father and his family to court for it but everyone said that she made me say it to get back at my father, since I was "only five" and "not old enough to know anything." None of them were punished for it and I had to keep seeing them on visitations until I was sixteen (i'm still sixteen) and I told my dad I didn't want to see him anymore. This obviously did not make him happy and he knows it is about the abuse. Every once and awhile he emails me or calls and tries to make me feel guilty about it and when he does I get upset all over again just when I had started to seem to get better. I really wanted to write a book about my life, but I figured that because my dad and his family wasn't punished or proven guilty that I'd be sued for it. I want to change my last name and then get a pen name, but my mom says I have to wait until I am eighteen. I don't exactly want to wait that long to write my book, but I feel like I don't have a choice. I've considered taking them back to court but I figured it's probably hopeless and I feel guilty and doubtful even though I know it happened. Anyways, I don't want to put my mom through all that again. A lot of times I think that I imagined it all and deny it because I wish it didn't happen. I really want to be a writer and to help people who've been abused, but without proving my abusers guilty I feel as if this is impossible, that it isn't my right. I'm scared they'd be found innocent and then try to kill me for taking them to court. What should I do? I know everyone here is having a hard time and I really don't mean to be a bother. I feel guilty just talking about it because there are so many others who've had the same thing happen to them but I really needed advice.
