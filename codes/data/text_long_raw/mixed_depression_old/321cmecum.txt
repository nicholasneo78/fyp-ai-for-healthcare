My hearing, attentiveness and social awareness has been completely off since dropping into a very low depressive period as of late. Normal?
Walking through a busy shopping center today and I feel heavy and zoned out. I ordered food at a bakery and could barely hear my voice as I spoke. I didn't hear the employee very well and unknown to me like 8 high school kids entered as I was browsing and I didn't even notice until I visually saw them.

The sunlight drains me quick. And when crossing a street I often triple take even when absolutely nothing is coming.

Fuck this.
