People who have sought professional help? Was it worth it?
I know it's a positive start. I have never sought professional help so I'm not diagnosed with any mental or emotional conditions, however, I feel so empty and sad all the time. I tried talking to my parents however my dad  told me to man up and my mother goes on about Jesus. I've spent the past 3 years at uni in a foreign country, I go like 10 classes max per semester, n once failed an entire semester because I couldn't bring myself to do more than leave the bed most days. If I stick it out I Kno I have a path to a good career (dad has connections, blah blah I Kno) n a few people ive talked to basically tell that I'm spoilt and "have it good." I feel guilty for existing sometimes. Guess I'm jus rambling now, have finals in about 5hrs n I'm doing my usual caffeine fueled all nighter to save something I don't intrinsically care about but still need cuz I'd feel even shittier if I don't get my degree. N when I do get it, I'll be just as purposeless and empty while im pursuing the next career step, it's a fucked up cycle.
