Why does it feel like I want to be depressed?
Idk, just something I've been thinking about lately and idk why.
Sorry if this is offensive to someone.

Edit: I am depressed, and I got this feeling of wanting to be depressed and idk why. Maybe to let people see that I'm having a hard time and get some comfort. Again, idk. I can't put my feelings into words atm.
