An Open Letter
Dear you,

It's been three years since we decided to go our separate ways. We both had different goals, desires and aspirations. We were perfect together, but just at the wrong time.

I'm sorry things ended badly. I'm sorry that for months after they spiraled out of control. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry I let you down, your family down. I'm sorry I buckled. I'm sorry I didn't have the experience or the know-how to react to certain situations.

I'm sorry that I made mountains out of molehills. I'm sorry at times I treated you badly, that at times I held you back.

Three years later, we live totally different lives than back then. I got that job. I traveled the world. I went to Italy - twice. I've been to Times Square at midnight, and so have you. I did it all, but by myself. It's not what I wanted. It's not what I envisioned. 

You can't just replace somebody special with another person, and that you were. Special. 

It's been three years. Despite some triumphs and successes, it still feels like I lost a war. An immense failure that didn't personify my persona, it personified myself. 

On the surface, I'm told I seem ambitious, fully ready to attack each day. On the inside, I feel defeated. 

In the end, you found somebody new, which is fine. I chose, whether consciously or unconsciously to stay on a different path. I've tried new women. Many beautiful on the outside, but they aren't you. Oh no, no, no. They all don't have what you had. 

Not even close.

Maybe one day I will end this crusade against myself, against the past. I can't change it, I can't alter the story, I can't lie to myself.

I wish I could tell you I'm sorry. But it wouldn't change anything. For you it's a battle that was fought long ago. For me, I relive it more times than I'd care to admit.

I'm emotionally crippled, distraught, defeated. It's been a long three years. 

I'm ready for it to be over.

I'm sorry.

Yours truly,

Me.
