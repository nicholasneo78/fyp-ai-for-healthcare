God giveth and God taketh away, but lately he seems to just be taking from me.
I'm tired of it all now. A little over a year ago my Grandfather who lived with us passed away. About 6 months ago my mother passed away. A week ago my father went into the hospital to have open heart surgery done on him, and today he came back and is definitely looking worse for wear. For the time being he can't do anything physical, can't drive, and just looks like he's in pain, and is talking about probably retiring.

Meanwhile in my life i'm struggling between choosing to go off to college or getting a full-time job. Only just a week ago I was getting ready to start to apply to FAFSA in preparation for actually starting college this year -- now with recent developments i'm not sure if that's even a viable option. I'll probably need to stay home and help out by getting a full-time job since both me and my brother are reliant on my dad financially, and my brother is already in college.

I really don't know what I want to do or what I even can do. Add onto more shallow but personal reasons for me to feel down, like the fact that I have no social life to speak of and honestly it's enough to make me seriously consider suicide. It all just feels hopeless to me, and I don't even really feel like living to see what the future holds because it feels as though it's all bleak in the long term.
