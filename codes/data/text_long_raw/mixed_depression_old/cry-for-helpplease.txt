theres nothing to look forward to
i used to tell myself that after high school things will improve, I can get away from home and college will be fun. i guess i wont really know until im there, but im not excited at all for college. I feel like im going to go through the motions in college and end up alone in a shitty job i dont care about since i dont care about anything and everything will just spiral downwards
