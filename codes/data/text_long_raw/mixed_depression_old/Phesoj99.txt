If you care, will you read?
My depression has gotten really bad over the last 2 years, and today I realized something. I don't have anyone. Everyone I talk to, people I'd call 'friends' don't really care. They only notice me when I'm the one who talks first. I make plans with them, set up so much and help everyone around me, but none of them care. I skipped school to see what would happen, and nothing. No one even noticed. My parents hate me, and I'm alone. None of this really matters, and no one cares. I'm just so tired, and I want it all to just end.
 
I don't know why I'm posting this, I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I don't know anything at all. And most of you are just going to look over this and leave. But if you care, will you talk to me?
