Hi everyone, I am a 39 year old complete mess up. I have suffered from depression most of my life. About 18 years ago my world crashed around my head. I went into blackness like no other. Attempted suicide several time, went through a period of self mutilation, went on every depression drug known to mankind, through years of therapy. This lasted 10 years. I took a massive overdose and was on life support for 5 days. When I finally regained consciousness my doctor told me it was a miracle I was alive. After that I seemed to put my life back on track. I still suffered periods of depression but nothing extreme. Until now that is. Now I feel myself slipping into that hole again and I am terrified.
