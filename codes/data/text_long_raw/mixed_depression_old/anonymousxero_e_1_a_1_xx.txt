How's it going, all who read. My name is Greg, I'm 19 and have had depression for basically as long as I remember. Here's a brief history of my journey through depression and the treatments I have endeavored. I began on lexapro. It seemed to be helping and then it quit on me (or perhaps vice versa). After that I tried zoloft, and wellbutrin, but to the same effect. Then I turned my world to narcotics (mainly, marijuana and DXM). They helped ALOT, but because they are illegal, I felt a constant public stigma and guilt. I couldn't take it, despite the amazing effects of both drugs. I'm now taking Paxil CR, but I'm going to quit it because it isn't working. I'm beginning to lose hope altogether. It seems apparent to me that SSRIs just aren't for me, or maybe I just haven't found the right one. The real problem with depression is that you have to wait a month on each drug just to see it it's going to work. Those months can feel like years. Anyways, that's who I am. I hope to make a few friends here, and a lot of advice as well. Does anyone one else share these symptoms (if so, and if you think you can help contact me please): Chronic fatigue, lack of motivation/desire, inability to enjoy life, insomnia (including the other obvious and supplementing symptoms) The real killer is I know I have the potential to be someone great, but I have to become happy first...Greg
