This sub is useless
I don't want to appear pessimistic or a negative person, but I do really believe this sub is useless.

This is the usual happening on this sub, op posts "i feel like shit because I have no friends"/ "life sucks" /"I want to feel normal" and other redditors reply with "yeah same" /"i understand"/"I feel like shit too".

I mean, what kind of reaction one expects from posts like this? I realize that op doesn't really want advices, he just wants to vent and I admit I've done the same, but honestly, did I feel better? Did I feel better after I realized other people are suffering with me? No. Maybe if I told a friend, to my brother that I'm feeling like shit, maybe, I would feel better,but to unknown people on the internet? What they tell me is worthless.

I don't need to feel comforted or understood, I need help from people and receiving advices on how I can improve my life or stories of people feeling better.
Something which is really lacking on this sub. I want to feel better and I don't care about intellectualizing my pain or feel comforted. If one day I feel I have no hope and no chance of feeling better I will kill myself. Today sucks, but tomorrow might not, so let's just try doing tangible efforts.

Thanks for reading.
