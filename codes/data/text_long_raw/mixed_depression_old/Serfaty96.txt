So fucking lonely...
I've been feeling so unbearably lonely lately and it feels like it's never going to end too. It doesn't make it any easier that my roommate has been sleeping with some of my best friends and the rest of my friends are all getting girlfriends and boyfriends. 

I've been really trying to put myself out there too which is why it's so crushing every time I see a friend of mine go on a date with someone they just met, but every time I try to ask a girl on a date she just stops responding to me....I feel like there is something deeply wrong with me and I don't know what it is!!! I really just want to die, I'm so sick of getting rejected and feeling like I'm never going to be loved.
