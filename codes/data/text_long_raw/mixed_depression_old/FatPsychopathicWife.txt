Journal Entry - 12:23AM Monday, December 4th, 2017
Just thought I'd share my thoughts from last night. I occasionally lurk Reddit looking for a relatable story, so I figured I'd share some of my own thoughts.

I don't want a job. 

The hardest part of having a job is talking. It's bad enough that I have to make eye contact. Having to speak on top of that can be nerve wrecking. 

Meeting new people is also tough. It's even tougher when you're the new one. Who are these people? Do I even want to know you? Are you going to try and get to know me? Am I going to allow it?

Customers are easier to deal with, but just a drag to have to deal with. It can be monotonous. Often, it’s annoying. But all the while, I just feel drained. 

There are good days at work. But there are also bad days. And those bad days make the lasting impression, in my experience. 

I'm thankful for those good days. But the bad days remind me that I want better for myself.

I'm tired of working in restaurants. I'm tired of wearing a stupid hat my hair can barely fit under. I'm tired of repeating phrases I'm told to repeat. I'm tired of seeing the disgusting process of how people’s shitty food is prepared. I'm tired of cooking, something I enjoy, feeling soulless. 

Historically, preparing a meal and feeding someone is a virtuous act, at least to me. The commoditization of it is a bit of a shame.

I detest consumerism, generally speaking. Customers are not my favorite people. Along with restaurants, I hope to avoid customer interaction at my next job.

I really don't want any job. When it comes to time &amp; energy vs. money, I'm all for the money until I find out what I have to do. Then my my time &amp; energy feels more valuable. Because it is more valuable.
