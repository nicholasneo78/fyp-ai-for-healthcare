everyone. well don't really know what to say so I'll just skip to the point. i haven't cut for a while but right now the thought of doing it again is looking really good. the last few days have just been really hard. i went from having a psychiatric assessment done to finding out that my mom had gone through my room and read all my personal poems and stories to then really wanting to talk about all this stuff to my boyfriend but not even being able to even do that. i just got back from seeing a movie with him and i just hate the fact so much that the one thing that i really want to do i can't because I'm a stupid freak that can't do anything right. i don't know but right now this is the last place i want to be. I'm just really tired. There are people that want me to talk and tell them what's wrong but i can't because I'm scared that they will run. that they won't understand and they just wouldn't care. I've already got a friend who is really annoyed at me because i don't try harder. i just really hate myself, i don't know what to do anymore. i just want to scream. i don't know what i need or want anymore. i just really need to cut but don't want to go back to it. i just don't know what to do
