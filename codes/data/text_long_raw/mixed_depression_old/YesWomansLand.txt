I am tired of spending every weekend crying.
It didn't used to be this bad. I was fine being alone and forgotten. I don't know what changed though. I guess it all just caught up to me. I have felt depressed for as long as I can remember but I was always able to handle it. I am really losing it lately though. Last year was bad. This year is already worse. I am too much of a quitter to make things better. I don't even know why I am posting this. I guess I just want someone to know I was hear.
