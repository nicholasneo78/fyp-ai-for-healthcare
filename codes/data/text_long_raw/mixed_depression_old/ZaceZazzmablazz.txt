blah
I'm having a hard time at work today. The hand sanitizer smell makes me want to drink. This persons mom dropped off a lunch for them, it was sweet, made me sad and miss my mom. Usually these things don't really get to me, but I woke up in a weird mood this morning. So everything seems so loud and apparent today. It kind of feels like the lights are screaming into my eyes.
