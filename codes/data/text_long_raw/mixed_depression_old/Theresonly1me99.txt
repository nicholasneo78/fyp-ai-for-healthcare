On the Verge of a Mental collapse
Hello everyone. I hope we all make it out of depression. 
I just want to post my feelings at this moment. It feels as though I'm on the verge of a breakdown. My life is in a very sad place. My parents are trying to keep upbeat and are hoping for the best. They know of my anxiety and depression. My mom drove me today and I didn't talk at all because I was in one of those moods I get in. I love my Mother a lot and she is very dear to me. I want to get out of this and become someone, but it is very hard. Anxiety has suffocated me and I'm afraid to go out in public due to feeling awkward and confidence issues. I have been crying a lot because I have lost hope in myself. When I look at pictures of myself or my family happy, I get emotional. The years are flying by me and I have no way to catch them. I see everyone around me getting older and I'm getting extremely saddened by it. My anxiety prevents me from going out in public and I waste away my days. My life is a mess right now.Thank you to all who read this and I hope the best for you all.
