Hi all, I'm new - just joined yesterday. I'm a 40-year-old wife and mother of five. I've struggled with depression my whole life - came from an abusive household and inherited some mixed-up genes. I was misdiagnosed last year with bi-polar II and spent a year on mood stabilizers and various other junk that made me a zombie. I'm now on Effexor and just beginning to feel sort of like myself again. I'm a freelance writer and I have a weekly column in our local newspaper. I feel like my creativity has gone to pot and I'm waiting for it to come back. Over the last 18 months I've become pretty reclusive - don't answer the phone, don't get out much, just take care of the basic family needs each day - so I've felt very alone. I stumbled upon this site while doing research on Effexor. I've read a lot of the posts and have felt some hope that this might be helpful to me right now. My husband is worn out, as am I. I just want to be better. I want to be a better mother. I don't want to live my life this way. I've felt like half a person for the last 18 months. I want to be whole again. I'm really struggling with self-esteem and guilt - I worry about what all of this is doing to my family. I hope and pray that my children are strong enough to go through this with me. Anyway, that's me, in a nutshell. I'm glad I found this place.
