ok, im having problems speaking to people about this so i thought I'd try the internet

I'm 20 years old and a student, about 8 years ago i had an experience that changed my life, my dad got himself a new girlfriend – that's where the problems started i won't go into the tedious details (unless you want me too) but basically this led to me developing an eating disorder and a serious case of social phobia (i used to lock myself in my room and only go downstairs for tea: literally) this lasted about 6 years - i suppose 6 years being alone would be enough to disrupt anyone's life .. anyway i have got over the eating disorder but the social disorder remains despite all my best efforts
Let me give you a few examples of how my life is at the moment. i can't even go to the local supermarket because the staff always want to socialize, i have to force myself to go down the launderette cause i don't want to be around other people, the list is endless. can you imagine what its like being a student and not wanting to be in social situations? my social skills have seriously degraded over the years and i desperately want at least one friend, but i don't know where to start. i moved out because i couldn't cope but now i lock myself away 24 hours a day and read my lecture notes over the internet

Basically i have no friends, no money and an addiction to alcohol(i was stupid, thought it would solve my problems) and today I've found out that the bank won't lend me any more money, and i can't get a job - working with others everyday is just inconceivable. i have a counseling appointment on the 3rd of may but i can't wait that long. things couldn't get any worst

i don't know why I'm writing this, but i guess i want someone to talk to that doesn't know me, so i suppose I'm looking for a penpal or just someone to talk to. and to make things worst i think i might be depressed - why else would i be crying while I'm writing this

any views on this would be appreciated, i can't keep going like this.
