I'm tired, I need someone to tell me I'm okay.
I can't tell what's wrong with me, I just feel moody for the past 7 days. Even though school just restarted and I should be high on my spirits.

I think it's probably the campus merger (some background info: my university originally have 3 campuses, 2 of them are quite small, hence closed down now, unluckily mine included and the students from those programs are gonna merge with the larger campus.) Its like there's something wrong but I can't pinpoint it.
I just felt that I should probably get this off my chest, before it eats me from the inside out.
