Does anyone else go way out of their way for others, because no one goes out of their way for you?
I have two roommates who are in a relationship together. I moved out of my parents house to live with them. I am on my own for the first time in my life. I have no one who cares about me anymore. 

Since it's Christmas, I bought them each a couple of gifts and also Christmas stockings since they've both never celebrated Christmas in North America. I filled them with a bunch of candies, chocolates, soaps, etc. 

It felt good to do this but also sad at the same time knowing I will wake up to nothing on Christmas morning.
