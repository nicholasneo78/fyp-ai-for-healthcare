I dont have friends.
So i was talking over phone to my female best friend. I was sharing my problem with her i had recently. Now we supposed to hung up. But unfortunately phone didn't cut. And i was able to listen her. She was telling my thing to her roommate in cooked manner. And I came to know that she was jealous of me all those years because I was good than her in studies and anything. And she was thanking god for failing me in my recent exam.
This thing just broke my soul. She was the last person i could trust. Now I am depressed af.
I didnt say a thing to her till now, i hung up phone myself, when i couldnt listen more. I dont know how to react when i am going to meet her next time.
