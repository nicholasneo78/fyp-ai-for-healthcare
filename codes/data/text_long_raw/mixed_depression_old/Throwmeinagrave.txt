Today, I found out that my depression is treatment resistant
I've been on 8 different antidepressants and the such. Prozac, Paxil, wellbutrin, pristiq, viibryd, seroquel, abilify, and trintellix. It feels like the past year and a half or so has been nothing but pills. I've been depressed since I was around 9 or 10, and now I know I'll probably be depressed for the rest of my life.

I'm about to start tms therapy. Has anyone here tried it? I don't want to get too optimistic after the utter failure that was the pills, but I would really like some encouragement so that I don't feel like I'm throwing my money away. It's covered by my insurance, but the co-pays do add up for the whole procedure.
