My mom asked me:"What held you back"
Today I went down to the city,I walked around for a while I went down to the river and stood there for a while than I went up to the bridge and stared down.I ran away from home.I didn't have my phone.My parents didn't know where I was.We had an argument for at least 8 hours and I just had enough.I had depression since I was 9(I'm 15).My mom always said I was just imagining it.When I got home they started yelling at me(rightfully so,I was away for 2 hours they were about to call the police,but I had to be alone for a while).An hour ago my mother asked me why didn't I just jump off if I have a "missarable" life.
All I could think of were these two things:1.I should have done IT
2.I was right about her
Any comments?
