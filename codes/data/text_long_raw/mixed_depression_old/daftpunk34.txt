School is making me so stressed
It’s all the time. I fell asleep last night feeling okay about stuff but woke up anxious and depressed not wanting to go to my classes. I have been failing 2 of my most important classes and I just have no reason to keep going to them. It’s finals week and I’ve been stressed about finals since school started. I don’t even know if I want to stay in school anymore because I don’t want to feel like this.

I’ve also been slacking off so much on homework. It doesn’t matter to me anymore it just feels so useless to do.
