Ever have that moment where your depression teases you at the worst times, then tricks you into making you think you're "fine".
Not sure how to explain it. Like, you really start to feel like shit at certain points during the day, but once you are near an item or person to communicate with (e.g. A journal or counsellor) you feel "fine" (not the good fine but the nullity type of fine). I don't know how to explain this and I don't like it because I want to be able to express this shit to the few trusted sources I have left.
