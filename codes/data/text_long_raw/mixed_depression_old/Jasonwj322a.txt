Who here forces themselves to act normal because of social anxiety?
I have really strong anxiety and depression. To the point where I hate being around people yet I don't like "loneliness".
When talking to people I try talking in a normal confident tone. Other than not taking initiative on things you really cannot tell I'm depressed.
