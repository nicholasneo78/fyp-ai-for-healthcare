I'm new here - wasn't quite sure where to start but "special new member posting area" seemed appropriate. I think I've been battling depression off and on for some time now. I saw a therapist briefly, for a couple months, but had to stop when it got too expensive and when I couldn't take the time off work anymore. I actually didn't even start seeing her until the worst of my depression had already passed. Not sure I got that much out of it, but maybe I didn't give it enough time. I was doing so well for a while, but in the last week or two, I can feel myself sliding back into it. There are certain things, issues, that tend to pull me into that hole. I'd done so well at avoiding them, I felt like I was over it. But I'm dwelling on them again, and I don't know what to do this time to break the hold. The smallest thing sets me off crying, and I've completely lost interest in the things I was so excited about two weeks ago, along with most everything else. I feel completely isolated - I have no one to talk to about this, which I guess is why I'm here online. OK not sure what the point of this post was, but thanks for letting me get it out. Sometimes it feels better just to tell someone, anyone.
