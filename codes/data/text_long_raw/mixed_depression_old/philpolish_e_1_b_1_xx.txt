Hi everybody. New member have been lurking for a while thought I would introduce myself. My name is Phil, have had depression all my life or as far back as I can recall. Why is it so hard to admit to yourself that you even have it? Any way I have been looking on internet for some info and come across this site which looks very friendly and inviting. I am taking citalopram at present and waiting to see a psychologist but she says I am not ready for her help which is very frustrating she says I wouldn't be able to function if she started therapy with me.  I work full time so I guess it is for the best. I am beginning to understand about depression a bit more now it would be nice to here from anybody out there who has suffered from depression and have found practical ways to deal with it. How do you get out of the dark hole, how do you feel like you are partaking in life and not just spectating. Anyway nice to know I am not the only one I do not feel so much of an alien now. Bye 4 now Phil.
