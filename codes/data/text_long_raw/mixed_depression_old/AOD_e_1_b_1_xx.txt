Nice to see you too!!! How are you today? I think you really have hit the mark on what I was trying to express with this question - all the negativity and darkness that is contained in almost every media outlet you can name. The disasters you mention, such real human tragedy but the way the media went after it was appalling and seemed to be muddled in politics and ratings. As for those forensic shows - ugh! I used to be able to watch them but way before this recent "episode" of mine I stopped. I couldn't stand the heartache of knowing what evil lurks out there. Where I work now one of the first friends I made was a gentleman who has since retired. He told me that he didn't read the news, watch TV or listen to the radio (except for light jazz) because he found that to do so was just too much pain, it did not "serve" him to subject himself to that kind of pain. He seemed to be generally very happy and upbeat to me so there must be something to it. As for your friend - that's a tough one but maybe since she is your friend she might understand if you explain to her how incredibly painful her TV choices are on you. Does she ever read or post here? Anyway, it is GREAT talking with you again and I look forward to the next chat. I hope you have a wonderful day and weekend.
