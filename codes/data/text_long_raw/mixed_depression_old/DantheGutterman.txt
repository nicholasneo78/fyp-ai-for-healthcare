Questionable at best
So I've been having depression/anxiety problems since middle school, I have suicidal thoughts time to time, but I have no desire to act on them? I don't mean to waste anybody's time, but sometimes it's really odd, I get these thoughts all the time usually after something angers me or upsets me, but later on I just continue with my day. My depression isn't too serious, I've had small attempts, like holding a hand full of pills but never going through with it. My anxiety seems to be more severe than any other problem I have. I'll be at work, just doing whatever and bam, I get anxious out of nowhere. I try breathing exercises to no avail, eventually it goes away.. I usually smoke a bunch of weed and that seems to work but I can't do that at work or anything, anything I can do to help with that without drugs?
