Ok, sometimes i feel so pathetic because i have these friends who are pretty and could have any guys they want but they don't really care about getting married, and here i am ugly and that's all i can think about. I don't know why but i feel like there is some kind of pressure on me to get married. Because my cousins, who are like my brothers, both left home before they graduated and started dating younger girls so i feel like I'm a failure b/c i still don't have a boyfriend and I'm almost 16.I'm not sure if they really think that or if i just imagine it but either way that makes me want to hurt myself but then I'm like what good would that do me and if my arms and legs are all messed up then guys will definitely (spelling) hate me. I don't get why i care so much but i do. I want to be happy with my life and to be happy with what i got but i don't know how i always think that if i just forget about not having a guy in my life that i will be happier and maybe even eventually get one but it doesn't work but i don't know what i should do. So if you have any ideas please tell me .
