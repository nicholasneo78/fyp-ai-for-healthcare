First of all, a happy Christmas to one and all. My situation is that I have had moderate depression on and off since 18 years old, and 2 years ago aged 33 I had it so bad I had to be off work for 3 months. Then I tried the SSRI Escitalopram and it worked perfectly and I went back to work. I came off it a year ago and then 4 months ago I suffered a relapse and had to go back on it, and now I am OK (except when it came back for 3 days after a booze bender). My psychiatrist is saying I should take them indefinitely. As I have no side effects I am happy with this, but I am concerned about some reports saying that they start to work less well after some years. Is this right. And if so wouldn't it be better to ration them so I only take them after I relapse? So they keep on working for longer, if not the rest of my life. Is there anyone on the boards here who has been taking antidepressants for many years who has found they have become less effective and now regrets having taken them for that reason. And now suffers depression that now cannot be treated by medication? Yes I've heard that you can switch to others, but surely the same type of reasoning applies? The psychiatrist said that I had endogenous depression with a reactive cause, and that she didn't think that counseling would help. Does this make sense? A former work colleague of mine recently said that the antidepressants had made me start acting "weird". Well apart from posting on an internet forum I don't think I've done anything weird, and other friends agree with me. But other friends all think that it is not good for you to keep taking these "happy pills" for a long term, that antidepressants are a short term fix only.
But what do they know. You can't really tell if others have depression from the outside. Neil (35 years young, from the UK)
