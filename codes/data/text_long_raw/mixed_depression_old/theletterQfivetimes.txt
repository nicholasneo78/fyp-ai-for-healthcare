I feel like if anyone got to really know me they'd find out I'm weird and awkward
and they'd stop wanting to be around me. I'm terrified of getting close to people, but I want friends, so I keep doing this dance back and forth of trying to hang out with people then cutting contact before becoming friends. 

As far back as I can remember, whenever I've tried to join a group conversation I've gotten weird looks, or people not understanding what I'm saying. I've learned that the less I say, the less awkward people will be around me, and I hate it.
