I think I am depressed but I am not sure
I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me but I think I might have depression.
1) I love going out with friends. I am very active person, but lately for example even when I am laughin I suddenly stop and get very sad. I do not know what is wrong but I get very sad and I lose interest in doing everything.
2) Lately I can not focus. I have never been fun of doing homework but I was always doing it. Now I just can't I am just laying bad instead of doing homework. You might say I am been lazy but also I am music producer and I absolutely love music, but lately I just can't. When I sit down I just can't focus on it and I end up going to bad after 15 minutes.
3) I am sleepy all the time and I am sad most of the times. I do not have specific reasons but I am.
4) I  became very insecure. It feel like my friend do not like me. I feel like they do not want me to be around them and I just do not know why.
5) Most of the times on weekdays I am just laying on my bad and listening sad music and I feel like I am wasting my time.
Sorry I think I do not make any sense at all but rn I am feeling really bad and can't think properly.
