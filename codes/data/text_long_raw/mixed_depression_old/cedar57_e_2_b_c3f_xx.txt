This may not be the right place for me to write but I just had to write somewhere.  I have not been clinical diagnosed depressed but I am not feeling "happy" right now.  I just can't seem to get over that my son's father, who left us 4 years ago, has a new family with a younger girl and another child on the way.  I can't seem to get myself out to meet to new people.  I know that I am the really the only one that can make things better for me.  I don't feel connected here where I am living.  I feel like I am missing out on something.  I just don't feel wanted anymore.  The only thing that I am glad about right now is that my son's father is finally caught up on child support.  Am I crazy, depressed or just plain stupid?
