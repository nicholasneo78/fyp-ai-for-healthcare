I finally got antidepressants
I finally bit the bullet and saw a doctor about getting some meds because my life is in shambles lol. 2018 is looking pretty alright. 

I got prescribed 10mg of escitalopram (Cipralex). Anyone else on it? Any tips n tricks? The side effects seem pretty standard for an SSRI.
