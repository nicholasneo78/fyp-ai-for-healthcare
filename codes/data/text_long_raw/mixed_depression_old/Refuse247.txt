Negative PTO balance
Just started a job about 6 months ago and I'm already negative on PTO because it's often too hard to make it out of bed due to crippling depression/overwhelming anxiety/etc. I also had a switch in depression meds, which wreaked havoc on my brain for several weeks.
  

Without having FMLA (&lt;1 year as an employee), what are my other options for time to heal? My bosses don't know about my depression and I haven't sought assistance from my company's EAP.
