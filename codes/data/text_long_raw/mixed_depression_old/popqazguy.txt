Does anyone else find masturbation numb when their depressed?
Not numb physically, but just so much like a routine now that it feels numb. Kind of like "i know this isnt going to help me feel less lonely, but having an orgasm feels pretty nice for now".

I dont know i just hate looking back at my day and realizing i wasted so much time doing nothing but wanking. Anyone has advice for this?
