I'm still obsessed with her.
At the start of the year, I made a post talking about how I've been obsessed with an older girl for well over a year. Of course, nothing's changed.


I watched a video of her earlier. Happy and giddy with excitement. She jumped around and kicked her legs, unable to contain her excitement. She was so happy and full of enjoyment. 


But seeing her be so happy without me has put me in a state of deep depression since. Even typing though his out is painful. 


Knowing I'll never be with her, whilst she lives out her life happy and free makes me feel down to no end. I'm so miserable, I can't even describe it.


Why am I even here? As if venting on the internet is going to change anything. I wish she'd love me.
