Clingy friend
So I have a friend who lives pretty far from me. Let me preface this by saying that he has expressed a romantic interest in me, but I am not interested in men, and have told him so. He helped me through a difficult time in my life, and I have thanked him many times for it. I have tried to do the same for him on multiple occasions, but it seems like the more attention I give him, the more he wants. I do not feel that we need to have hour long phone discussions and 26 text messages on a daily basis - I don’t talk to ANYONE that much. I started ignoring a text or two here and there, hoping he would catch on. He did, apparently, and we just went about 3 weeks with no contact. 

Had he sent me a normal text today, I would have answered. Instead, he sent a passive-aggressive “Ever since you’re feeling better, you never bother to call me.” 

This is simply NOT true. I have called him many times when he said he needed to talk, even though I hate talking on the phone. I just simply can’t take this level of neediness. I’m not sure how to explain to him that constant contact drives me nuts and I need space. Every time I try to explain this to him, he seems to feel that it was designed as a personal attack against him. 

Any thoughts on this? I’m not going to text him back until I’ve had some time to think about the right thing to say.
