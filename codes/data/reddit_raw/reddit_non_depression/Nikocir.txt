Friends making ammends
I previously wrote about this. A friend and I got into a fight where I said I don't know if I can be friends because a situation occurred where I was hurt and many different events kept piling up. I knew I felt very depressed with that friendship though she never really did something bad like other people post on here. It was more like she did something I was not okay with and she never really reached out to me ( months). She was my best friend and someone I love and care about. I know I made my mistakes as well. She texted me to reach out and I talked to normally to her didn't get angry/say anything angry... just small talk... 

Can we ever be close friends again and how? Should I now reach out or just focus on me? A problem we had was because she never reached out and now she did.. so is it my turn and when will it be appropriate?
