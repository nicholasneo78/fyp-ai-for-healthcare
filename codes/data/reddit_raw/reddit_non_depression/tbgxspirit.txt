Sister does not want to take care of my expensive belongings?
Well, I have a macbook pro that I paid for around 1700$ I let my sister use it for college and for whatever reason. Im fine with that but the moment she does not follow my rules of using it such as eating and drinking next to it. God forbid that she spills something and bam 1700$ down the drain. Not like she would care she didn't pay for it. haha I also threatened to change the password so she wont be able to use it and she said she would break it if I did. Haha man the logic. What do you guys think I should do. (also shes 24 and im 21)
