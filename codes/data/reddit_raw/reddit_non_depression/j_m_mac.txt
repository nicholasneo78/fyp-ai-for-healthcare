I don’t want to continue like this
For the past few years, I’ve found it extremely difficult to talk to my mom. Some family drama happened a while back and ever since then she’s been really tense and on edge. Almost every time we have a conversation it turns into a debate, usually ending in me sobbing and her yelling (I’m not trying to paint myself as the victim; I’ve said some nasty things to her as well).

I’m afraid to bring up my anxiety/depression, because whenever I have in the past she rants about how therapy and medication doesn’t work, there are plenty of natural remedies, yada yada yada. I just want to not start panicking every time I’m in public!

She’ll often blow things way out of preportion to what they actually are. If my tone changes during a conversation, or I let out a heavier breath, she thinks I’m “talking back” or scoffing at something she said and start yelling and threatening me. I feel like it might be paranoia, and it’s getting worse.

I basically dread every interaction I have to have with her, but I would really like to have normal mother/daughter conversations, go shopping, have her help me with homework, whatever. Instead of arguing nonstop from morning till night. I just fucking hate it.

Am I being dramatic? If not, what can I do to remedy the situation? If so, then it wouldn’t be the first time.
