what is going on with my mom?
As I've gotten older I identified something which was probably a source of a lot of neuroticism growing up, but I'm not really sure I'm in the right for noticing this. I have no idea what this is, I haven't met many other people that do this. But my Mom will do this thing where, the happier I get, the less comfortable she is around me. She tries almost frantically or rabidly to cut me off mid sentence or like "steal my affectation." Like mirroring that is a bit too eerily similar.  Its almost like a "being a person contest." I always feel like, gross afterward. Like someone got in my head and took a part of me then did a parody of it. It seems like nothing is going in, and only like warped versions of what I just said are coming out. Like her identity is being threatened or something. And it's only when I'm happy. She seems completely comfortable when I am depressed, and its still all out, no in. It's like she's doing a one man play. I mean I could be overthinking this, I just don't know. Is anyone skilled with like psychoanalysis or something? It seems surreal. I've rarely seen people do this. Am I doing something wrong? Like, am I not being a person right or something? She seems so unnerved by signs of happiness. It almost makes me feel fake or something. It legit feels like I'm beating her at tennis or something. Like the more emotion I am feeling naturally, she tries to one up me. And hers does not feel natural. It makes me uneasy. Is there a reason a person would do this? I really am eager to know what this is or how I can avoid it or make ends with it.
