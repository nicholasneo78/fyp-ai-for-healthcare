Eating your friend's food
Hi
I'm curious about something.
I always have something to eat in my backpack (chocolate, candies etc.).
And I have this friend, who's often hungry and didn't bring any food with her. I have offered my chocolate to her may times . What I can't understand is, that she always takes soooo much. She sometimes even eats all of my chocolate or snacks. It's not that I have problems with it. For me, such a behavior is a lil bit impolite. I'm asking myself, if is it normal to eat all of your friends snack or take so much of it without asking if you can do it?
I'm not being racist here. But does it have correlation with a culture? She is an African. And her African cousin did the same thing too. I'm just curious
