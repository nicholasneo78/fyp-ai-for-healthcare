AIBU TO THINK that calling mum and dad "mummy and daddy" after a certain age is cringe?
My sister is 30 years old and still refers to our parents as "mummy and daddy". I can't be the only one to find this totally cringey?? I could understand more if it was directed at them but it's to others to when talking about them. Today we went for a meeting with our landlord and discussing the smell of weed coming from the flat below. When she said "I don't mind it so much myself, but it's just more when mummy and daddy come to visit I don't want them to be smelling it in the hall". 
I felt like disappearing into the groundðŸ˜’
Just me?
