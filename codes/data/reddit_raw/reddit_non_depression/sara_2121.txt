IDK WHAT TO DO ANYMORE
AH IM IN SUCH A DILEMMA. Basically I have this friend whom Iâ€™ve known for 10+ years and weâ€™ve always been quite different but were good friends nonetheless. Over the past 3 years this friends true colours have been slowly creeping out and its been really affecting me! Most recently she did some that was way out of line and really made me question who she is! Iâ€™ve tried cutting her out slowly and distancing myself but I canâ€™t really escape it since our university campuses are the same and sheâ€™s recently joined a club Iâ€™m in! Sheâ€™s basically just so fake around me and is so nice to everyone else and I ignore it and let it slide but the thing she did that was way out of line is something I canâ€™t get over? She also always makes me feel guilty for what I have and always makes me out to be just â€˜luckyâ€™ but nothing I have â€˜haveâ€™ is due to luck! Itâ€™s literally pure hard work??? And now that sheâ€™s joining this club itâ€™s gonna make things 1000x worse because sheâ€™s just going to show off to all the guys and be this super fake ass person? She thinks she can get away with it and basically try walk all over me just because sheâ€™s known me for ages cause otherwise she literally follows everyone else like a sheep? Iâ€™ve tried confronting her about her actions but she just laughs it off??? How can I just get over it all ready?? Itâ€™s really beginning to affect my mental health ðŸ˜­ like I didnâ€™t really speak either her over the last 2 months and Iâ€™ve never been happier but seeing her around college more literally makes my blood boil sheâ€™s honestly just so toxic and I feel like hanging with her in this club is going to ruin my reputation and what others think of me! I just donâ€™t want to be associated with her anymore ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
