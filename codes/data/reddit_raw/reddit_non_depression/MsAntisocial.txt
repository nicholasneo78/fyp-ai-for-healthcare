Friends Are Leaving Me Behind
Tonight one girl in my friend group blantantly told me that out our entire group she hated me the most and everyone doesn’t want to be around me. She tells me to admit my wrongs or that she and the other girls will go and basically gang up on me. I did admit my wrongs, but they didn’t want to admit theres. She says that they only I be apart of the group is through her. I don’t know what do? I’ve done all she has asked but was it really only my fault that our relationship might end?
