My stepmom wont let me back in my old home, mixed feelings.
My wife is pregnant with our second child and she didn’t want to keep it at first because raising one is tough but two sounds impossible.
With rent + daycare + my wife stop working for a year was going to be a squeeze.

I reassured her my dad is retired they have a live in house keeper/cook, 5 bedroom house. That we can move back in and help him with sone rent. My sister just gotten a job as a doctor and shes out. The house is empty aside from my half brother whos in high school.

My dad said yes of course but the following month my dad said my stepmom wasn’t feeling it. She want space and doesn’t really want to be around kids that often. My dad offered money but it was about help.

I thought it was a win win. My dad was complaining earlier how he was bored and he is working part time since ss and pension wasn’t enough. I was going to pay rent. And I thought grandparents like kids. I wasn’t expecting them to raise them. 

I can understand my stepmom side but i cant help but feel if my mom was still around this wouldn’t have been an issue. My dad doesn’t care but he has to look out for his wife.

My wife is stressed out and upset at me for acting like they would help us.

I been saving to buy a house for awhile i guess i will have to dig into those. And its a reality check for me your 33 years old and your parents cant always get your back. My father has helped me alot i am always thankful. But my stepmom and I always butting heads. 

There isnt a question here just venting.
