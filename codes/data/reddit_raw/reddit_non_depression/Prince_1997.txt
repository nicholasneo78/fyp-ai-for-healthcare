Need advice on a friendship!
Need advice on a friendship!So I’ve written on here a few times about this crush I had on this straight guy I worked with at work for a little over 6 months or so. To summarize it, in those short months or so we became friends I guess u can say. We both are a year apart, he likes sports, music, and video games, etc. Anyways I developed a crush on him and I couldn’t handle the fact it would never happen, so I said to myself to try and make this friendship something memorable. We hung out 3 times outside of work, the third time was kind of quick but it was still outside of work and it happened last Friday, which I loved not only was I trying to catch up with him since we hadn’t hung out since December and it’s already March. So to put in perspective, I know it’s long but bear with me, it seems like our friendship is awkward at time, there’s long silences in between, don’t really have much to say. I mean for me it’s hard already hard enough for me to engage in a long convo, I’m sort of shy but I’m trying to break out of it, and don’t really have much to say, it sucks because I feel like I’m ruining a friendship that could be great. He kind of has the same personality when I’m with him. I don’t really have many friends well because they’ve all have been assholes to me, so I really don’t have many people to talk to when I want to. So what do u guys of my friendship with this guy? Is it me or do u think it’s complicacted? Just another one I don’t I ever receive text messages from him saying what’s up or checking up on me. Now take for granted he might have a lot of friends so idk. I’m usually the one who texts first
