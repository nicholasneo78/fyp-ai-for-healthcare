What do I call my sister that’s not my sister?
This would seem fairly complicated, I have a step brother and my step brother lives in a family his family has his real mum, step dad and step sister his sister isn’t related to my dad or my mom but related to my brother because they both have the same mom and me and my brother only have the same dad but different mom. So basically she doesn’t have my blood but has a brothers blood (my step brother doesn’t live with me) so what am I suppose to call her?
