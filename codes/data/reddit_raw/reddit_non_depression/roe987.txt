i have no respect for my father and im happy for him to die.
my dad has been an awful person my whole life (so far im 12) , when i was as young 8 he told me i have to study and go to university and if i dont im a failure to my family and he has spread rumours (all of which are false), tried to make me move in with him by saying my mum will kill me and that if i move in with him i can go to a private school + saying the current school im in is awful and 1 out of 100 kids will go to uni there even though 65 percent of people there get bachelors. and finally he has this thing to treat me like a baby and im sick of it, and earlier today i was making a glass of water and he said to me like i was 3 what are you drinking mr ryhan (my name is ryhan) i told him its just water cant you see it and that triggers fucking stupidity meltdown. i hate my dad i honestly dont care if he dies and i hope someone poisons him so he can get the bullet to the fucking head he deserves.
