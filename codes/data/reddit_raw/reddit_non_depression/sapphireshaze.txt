Why is my dad like this
My brother was recently tripped in the cafeteria as a joke. It was another friend and they do it to eachother all the time, but my brother ended chipping his front tooth.

The two of us go to a joint middle/high school and I really appreciated all my guy friends who went up to talk to him and ask if he was ok. 

Today these two guys ask me when he's going to get it fixed when I have to admit to them my dad doesn't want to take him to the dentist but rather just get him a grill. They laughed so hard. 

(This just seemed like a fun story to tell I didn't expect y'all to take this so seriously. My parents are separated and Im assuming that once we get to my mom's house she'll handle my brothers tooth.)
