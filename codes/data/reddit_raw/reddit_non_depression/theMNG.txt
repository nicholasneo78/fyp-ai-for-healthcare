How to enjoy my father
My father is 70, and a heavy smoker. He is healthy NOW, and still sane, but smoking is slowly deteriorating my father. I am only 16, my life is very busy, I go to school, come home, eat, sit in my room and work on my fast growing business, then sleep.

I hate being away but I HAVE TO! There is so much stuff that needs to be done toward my business, I don’t even have friends etc. I really want to spend time with my dad before it’s too late. I don’t wanna regret this.

What should I do to be able to get closer to my dad?
