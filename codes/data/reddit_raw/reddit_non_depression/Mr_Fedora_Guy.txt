What can I do so my friends don’t constantly put me down.
So lately I’ve been talking to more people and what not but I feel like I can’t confide in anyone. So there’s that, on top of it, this past week someone I’d consider a close friend was having problems with this guy she’s kinda friends with and something happened and she blocked him and I pestered her about it because I wanted to see if I could help and she got mad at me and stormed off. Everyone else with us started ganging up on me saying stuff like “This is why nobody likes you” and then my other friend comes over and tells them to keep me in the room (Theater stuff). Now everyone seems fine with me but it really upset me and I don’t know what I can do to change it. They said I ask the wrong questions and I feel like I just want to be included. I’m sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit or if I’m caught in the moment but I’ve had a day to think and it still is bugging me.
