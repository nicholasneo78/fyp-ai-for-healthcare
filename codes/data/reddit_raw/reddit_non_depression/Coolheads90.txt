My friends ended up voting for the other guy in the end. Should I feel betrayed or pissed?
They campaigned for me and shared everything with me. Nothing bad had happened among us, the other candidate was a friend and a good boy though. They ended up voting against me. I don't even know how to deal with them in the future or if I should blame myself for everything. I am dispaired.

How would you feel?
