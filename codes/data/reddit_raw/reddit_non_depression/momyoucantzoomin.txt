If my cousin got a new step brother, and I married him, would it be incest/ I be her step sister in law?
My cousin and I are talking on the phone about her dad (non blood to me) who is divorced from her mom. If he married someone with a son, and I married him, would I be her step sister in law? Is that a thing?
