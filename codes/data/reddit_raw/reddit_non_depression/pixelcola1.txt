My own worst enemy
How do you get and keep quality friends if you don't know how to be one?

I have bad, selfish, manipulating behavior because of my bipolar. I'm passive aggressive, always needing approval and I don't think I have any empathy.

I want to change. I don't know if I can. The best I can hope for is that people tolerate me.
