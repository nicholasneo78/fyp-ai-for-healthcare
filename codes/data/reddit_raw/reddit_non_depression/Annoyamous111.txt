My friend groped my sister
Simple as that, I’ve stopped talking to him and am happier for it but he was a very close friend and it doesn’t feel resolved (I have beaten him up too if that wasn’t a given) I cannot express my rage in words for him so I won’t try but I need a conclusion to all this (this happened about 2 days ago)
