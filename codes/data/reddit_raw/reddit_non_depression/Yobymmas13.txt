My favorite friend left our friend group?
He is kind of cocky, and selfish, but i like the guy and i saw him as kind of this professional extrovert because he is just so confident and knows lots of people and i kind of looked up to him for that. He made a valuable asset to my friend group of 4, but suddenly he just left for another friend group, a group that is filled with selfish annoying sport fanatics, and they are very passive agressive towards him, but he seems to enjoy it, even though i think that he would have it much better in our friend group where we all just have fun with eachother and just act friendly. I know about letting something go and if it doesn't come back then it wasn't meant to be, but i really miss the guy. (ps We are all guys)
