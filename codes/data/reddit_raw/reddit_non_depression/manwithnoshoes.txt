Does Suicide Ruin a Wedding?
My younger sister is getting married this June. She’s a couple of years younger than me and more successful in every single way possible. How close can I take my own life without affecting the wedding? I can’t bear to go to it, but I don’t want to ruin it for her. Should I go ahead and go now, or can I afford to wait a month or two?
