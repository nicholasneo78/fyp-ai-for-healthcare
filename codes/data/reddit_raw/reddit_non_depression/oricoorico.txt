How to stop being friend with a person that i'm envious of ??
Hi...

I'm a university student who befriend with a person who also study in the same university as me as well as enrolling in the same bachelor degree. 

When i befriend with this person, i just feel a lot of inconveniences and jealousy in my life. Honestly, i often feel envy of his high scores, actually sometimes i even help him to do an assignment (like sending him a copy of my assignment) which annoyingly also makes him get a higher score than me. 

He is a good guy, but i just really don't want to befriend with him anymore because of this kind of inconveniences and jealousy. I know, maybe some of you see me as the "Toxic Friend" or the "Bad Guy" here, but, i don't really care. The question is... How to stop being friend with this person in a gradual way ?? If i stop helping him in doing assignments, will it help me to break this friendship ??
