I am scared
Hey guys, posting this on a throw away just incase.

Anyway, a bit of back story:
Me and this guy at work met because of our smoking habits. We both happen to smoke weed, so naturally we started hanging out together. It was all cool for a while, and then he started getting needy, trying to get whatever he could from me. He would ask for cash, ask me to buy him food, ask me for bud etc.

Then I found out by mistake that he is a meth smoker, which is something I do not agree with at all. He just became more hostile around me after this point (not physically, only slightly verbally/emotionally), so I decided to slowly break the tie.

So I started to ignore his messages and Facebook texts. I quit work btw (its been 6 months). He doesn't know where I live, but we both know that our town is very small. Basically everyone knows everyone here. So the chance of me meeting up with him in the future is very possible.

Anyway, as bad as all that sounds, I want to try and mend the relationship. What should I do?

I've added an image for reference:

Edit: I never blocked him, I deleted my account because fuck Facebook.
