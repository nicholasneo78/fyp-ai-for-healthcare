100% always try to be a nice friend but sometimes i dont want to, am i mean
im in grad school. 
it will be way to long to explain the details
but whenever i go out with a group of friends, this girl always texts me when she hears about it or sees pics, of why i didn't invite her. 
the thing is i know she's not exactly on good terms with them and i dont know how much they get a long. am i always obligated to ask her for when we go out.
