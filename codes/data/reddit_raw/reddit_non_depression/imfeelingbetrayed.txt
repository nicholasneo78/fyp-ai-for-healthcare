Being Manipulated
Hi, so, I recently met this new group of people, and it's been pretty nice being with them, but there's this one girl that I have a crush on. About a week ago, one of my friends whom I have known for ~4 years told her, and she said there was a high chance she would go out with me, and has been telling me stuff she has said, and he said that if I was going to ask her out, I should wait 1-3 weeks. Well, recently, they seem to be getting closer and closer to each other, and I have heard that he has a crush on her as well, and wants her to date him instead of me, and when I asked him about it, he got all defensive about it. For a little bit of extra context, he said that he wouldn't ask her out, but would be open to dating her.

What should I do?

Edit: He said he was trying to get her to go out with me, and said he was helping me.
