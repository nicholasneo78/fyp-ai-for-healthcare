Backstabbing fake “Friend”
So just as me and my friend were getting closer my boyfriend sent her a dick pic. (Boyfriend thing is settled), but the friend thing not so much. She sent him partially clothed pictures, and she definitely has some sort of feelings for him. This happened a month ago and me and her haven’t talked about it much. She acts like nothing happened and she asks me for favors. I honestly hate her now but I’m pretending to like her to her face. How do I take the next step of ending our friendship a month in already? This is so hard.
