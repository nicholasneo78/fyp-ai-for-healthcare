Susceptible Younger Sibling
I have a sexually active younger sibling who severely lacks proper sex education. She will not confide in me, our parents or any family for that matter (she’s afraid that my extended family and myself will snitch to our highly-religious parents, who are against premarital sex), but casually revealed her "activities” to our hairdresser who felt uneasy by what she had heard. With that said, the hairdresser informed me of what was said, fearing that my sister may be in danger of herself. 

Situation: 

My sister's partaking in sexual relations with her boyfriends (yes, boyfriends since they change every few weeks) WITHOUT protection. She has very low self-esteem, and goes for guys with “nothing going for them” (i.e. no job, no education, drug-dealing/taking, etc.). But what triggered my hairdresser (whose primary concern is SAFE sex) to contact me was the fact that her current boyfriend is uncircumcised, does not use protection and has convinced my sister that “pulling out” is safe sex—revealing their lack of adequate sex education. Furthermore, my sister has complained (to me/our parents) of yeast infections and UTI’s, checking in-and-out of the clinic on several occasions, but casually dismisses it as wearing too-tight skinny jeans. And while my mother is comfortably in-denial and takes everything my sister says for face value, my father and I have had our suspicions about what may really be going on for awhile now.

Some background information:

- Sister comes from an upper income family 
- Youngest of 3, very spoiled
- Fast-tailed, boy-obsessed, hates being single
- (Barely) of legal age (technically “grown”, but not independent, so she lives with our parents who expects her to live by their rules until she moves out).
- Was brought up Christian
- Strong preference for men from poverty-stricken/rougher backgrounds and engage in illegal activities (I suspect she thinks it’s edgy?)
- Has a job, but devotes every last penny either uber-ing/lyft-ing to be with her (job-less) boyfriends or loaning them money
- Loving immediate/extended family
- Very manipulative, yet extremely impressionable when it comes to guys
- Current boyfriend is from overseas, deals/does cocaine (and pressures her to join in), jobless, without education, ill-tempered, manipulative and violent. Also his parents are entirely against their relationship due to her being of a different race/ethnicity than him. 
- Previous boyfriend was also ill-tempered, manipulative and violent, but also physically/verbally abusive, dealt weed, had no job/HS drop-out and made a “runaway” attempt with my sister which was prevented after I “snitched” to my parents (hence the reason she no longer confides in me, but I felt it was necessary given the severity of the situation). Cops were even involved. 

My parents have attempted to send her to a prestigious out-of-state college to get her mind off of guys and focus on her studies, however she shows very little interest in education, let alone bettering herself in any form or fashion. She “lives in the now” and has a very blinkered outlook on life.

With everything said, I would like advice on how to handle the situation (i.e. what to do with the information). Should I relay it to our parents and risk “rattling” on my hairdresser (i.e. the source/proof in which my parents will ask for)? Should I mind my business and risk my sister catching something more severe/getting pregnant/etc.? Not to mention her current boyfriend's gang/violent/drug-related background could potentially put our family at risk (she's revealed our location/faces via social media and casual talk--entirely against our wishes) should they ever break up or anything of the sort (we had to place a restraining order on her last violent boyfriend). I have a very strong conscience and do not believe that I could live with myself should the latter happen. 

Sorry for the novel, but I wanted to expound as much as possible to give an accurate reporting of the situation at hand. I have always been over-protective over family (my little sister especially), and it breaks my heart to see her follow such a destructive path. Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.

Thank you.
