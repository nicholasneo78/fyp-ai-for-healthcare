What are some boundaries you have in place with your parents and in-laws?
I just recently got married [27f] and my husband's [28m] mother is having a hard time with being in a support role.  She has had access to his bank account and a credit card in his name until we got married.  I love and support her and their relationship.

We do not financially depend on either of our parents nor do they depend on us.  I have read a lot about how to set boundaries but there are very few specific examples of boundaries couples have in place that make their relationship stronger.

My husband and I are on the same page that our relationship and boundaries need to be the priority but love our family. We do not have children
