X post (friendship, nintendoswitch) Looking for a friend
I am looking for a friend who enjoys talking about video games(more specifically, anime, and someone who I can talk to about my life.

A little bit about me:Obviously, I enjoy Nintendo games(as seen with my user name), anime(and yes, I do have a waifu), and computer programming.  My dream for the future includes working for Nintendo and moving to Seattle amongst many other aspirations.  I love my parents and would do anything for them.

Religion: Atheist, but believe that it will soon be possible to transfer your consciousness into a computer so that you can continue to "live".  I really just hate death, so that's why I believe in this.

Country: Canada, but maybe USA soonish(~8 months).

Any questions, just PM me.
