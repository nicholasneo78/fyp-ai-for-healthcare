Mother is always trying to start something.
My mom and I have a rocky relationship, I love my mom but sometimes I absolutely cannot stand her or the things she does. It stems from her depression that she has, but she always blames everything in the world for her problems and never herself. Yesterday, she texted me that my grandparents were moving from our hometown they've lived in since the 80's and to the town where more of our family lives. I sent a picture of my discount card from my job and said they could use it if they needed to buy boxes or moving supplies. She replied with "That's it no emotion?" Should I have been more emotional to the situation? I don't blame my grandparents for moving because I moved out of state last year. I don't care what my grandparents decide to do because it's their decision to move. I don't blame them for moving at all.
