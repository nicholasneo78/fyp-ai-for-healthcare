{Experience} Angry Sibling
I have a sister who will tell you she's the most laid-back of us all, but the truth is her anger will zoom from zero to 10 in the blink of an eye.  When we converse she will criticize or take exception with something I've said and I have to gently remind her that I'm only telling her how I *feel*; I'm not disagreeing with her opinion, or whatever.

Thing is, it's getting more and more difficult to talk with her as it seems as though *ANYTHING* sets her off these days!  And while I've nothing at all against Bill Burr - I actually think he's hilarous! - talking to her is like trying to talk back to one of his on-stage rants, understand?!  Because he's ranting to be funny, but she actually means what she says.

I love this sister, and am closer to her than many of the five sisters I have, but I'm beginning to point this out to her because I don't think she realizes the way she sounds.  Almost everything is said in a confrontational or defensive tone of voice!?!?!  And I just don't understand *WHY?*  Should I suggest therapy?  Anti-depressants, or anti-psychotics?  A shrink?
