overbearing family.
I (19f) am living away from home for college in my 2nd year. However, I still feel very under the control of my mother. It is just me and her at home, and rest assured she has always done her best for me but recently I’ve had enough of how much she expects from me. I am studying for grade 6 piano and the fact is that I simply don’t have time for it. She wanted me to do the exam for it after only studying it for 3 months (bare in mind I only get to practice once a week as I have no piano away from home - I come home at weekends). When I postponed it she screamed at me for hours and called me an idiot and various other things. I told her I was too busy with college work, I got my results back for college and did very well; however, she still wasn’t happy. First comment was “maybe you’re not as stupid as we think” and then said that I could do a lot better, even though I did really well. 

I never leave the house when I’m at home for weekends or any holidays because when I go out or meet my friends she makes it very difficult as she usually starts a row before I leave and guilt trips me about going. 

I have been wanting a full time bar job for summer, as that’s where my experience is but she is even controlling where I work and telling me where to apply to. She keeps guilt tripping me about being away for college, and saying I’m on a permanent holiday. 

She is annoyed at me for having a boyfriend; she never uses his name only refers to him as “your friend” in a sneering voice, and she won’t meet him. 

She is by no means a bad person, she has always been a very good mother but the pressure she is putting on me is too much and I feel very restricted, and at times, controlled. BUT I am not giving out about her, simply want to understand why she is acting this way when I’ve given her no reason to distrust me and I’m trying my best. 

TL;DR - mother is controlling, putting huge pressure on me and is never happy no matter how well I do.
