Awful Friend Trying to Reunite Friend Group
I have this friend, let's call him G, and he was a part of a friend group that I brought together. To make a long story short, he got bored, and (admittedly) lied about me to them, then when he found out they didn't like him as much as they liked each other, he ran back to me. I let him be my friend again, and he outed me as bi to my religious summer camp, which I then had to leave. He came back 3 months later saying he was going to therapy and he realized what he did wrong and was trying to get better, so we kept distant contact, but I found out last week he was still friends with the people he lied to (who are now gossiping about me and trying to convince my friends to end their friendships with me). I told him I was done being friends with him because he constantly endangers me or puts me in uncomfortable positions, and he called me crying about how he just wishes things were "like they were in freshman year" and that he "should have never lied to them". I hung up. He messaged me this morning asking me to meet up with our old friend group over spring break. I don't know what to do. I want my friends back but I'm scared they will hurt me again.
