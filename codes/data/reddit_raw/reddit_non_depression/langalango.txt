friendship over wedding
im Not sure if it is appropriate to end a friendship because I wasn’t invited to a wedding but everyone else in the group of friends were and I didn’t even know about it. She did not even bother telling me. This was a very special friend to me and I would tell her everything about me back in college and she was the most important person to me. I tried keeping in contact after she graduated by texting her at least once a month etc. but she would hardly ever respond. It seemed as if I was making much more of an effort than she was. When I found out that I wasn’t invited but everyone else in our group was, she hurt me in a way so deeply that she could never understand. She did tell me that I was on her list of people she wanted etc. when I found out, because she was that important to me, I couldn’t eat, sleep or study for my liscening boards for over a week. I lost seven pounds over one week, I called my psychologist a couple of times, cried endlessly. And it really hurt to know that maybe we weren’t as close as we once were. I am not sure if you can understand how I really felt. I’m not even sure if it’s appropriate to place it in a thread like this. I’m not sure if it was appropriate for me to end a friendship due to this situation?

And is it true that if person A does not invite person B to the wedding, and if person B got hurt by it, that person A has to accept the result of person B wants to end the friendship?
