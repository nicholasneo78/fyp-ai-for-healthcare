Cousin cutting off family.
So my cousin has stopped talking to any of our family including his mother and brother. I just assumed it was just life getting in the way, but recently my dad tried to contact this cousin about some money he loaned him to buy my old car (which I sold to him well under half of market value), because my dad needed the money to pay for a surgery (he has stage 4 liver cirrhosis). My cousin never replied and money aside I can tell this really hurt my dad (he's bottling it, but I can tell) considering this is my Dad's favorite nephew. I feel like this is my cousin throwing a bit of a tantrum over having to be an adult (he just barely turned 19) and I texted him to call me when got off work to explain how serious my fathers illness is (our grandma died of the same condition) and how he shouldn't cut off his uncle who has done a lot for him, but it's been 3days already. My main motivation for this is that I know stage 4 cirrhosis can move to end stage very suddenly and I want my dad to have as few regrets and worries during what may be God forbid his last few years. I just wanted to talk about this. Advice is very welcome and before anyone suggests he doesn't have the money, he does, he just sold the car we sold him for above market value and has a very good paying job as a mechanic at a car dealership.
