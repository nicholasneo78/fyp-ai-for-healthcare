Draft message to my half sister who I found on FB that doesn’t know I exist - what do we think? Any suggestions?

“Hi X,

I don’t know if you know about me. I’m your older half sister, your (our) father X was married to my mum, before he met yours, and they had me in 1992 before they then got divorced. I’ve always known about you, and your brother and sisters, and I hope he told you about me too. 

If not I know this will be a big shock and the last thing I want to do is cause any harm. But I don’t want to pass the chance that maybe we could get to know each other, and I really hope that you feel the same way. I live in Radlett so we’re not far apart, and if you wanted to meet for a coffee and a chat one day that would be amazing. I really hope I hear from you, and I hope this doesn’t cause any bad feeling with your family, or between us. I’ll be keeping my fingers crossed.”




Any thoughts, comments or suggestions would be very much appreciated. I’ve decided I definitely want to get in touch, just need a little help on what to say or a boost to just go ahead and do it! 

Thank you reddit
