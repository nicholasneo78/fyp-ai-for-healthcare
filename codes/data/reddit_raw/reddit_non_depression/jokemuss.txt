Friendships
I am heartbroken.I have a gorgeous looking,kind,caring and funny 19y old son who is struggling to make friendships in Christchurch.He also struggled to make friends at school.Anytime meet ups were/ are organised they pull out on him.He told me today he has given up asking folk to meet up.He was fun and sociable within school and college hours but no one ever seems to invite him anywhere.He doesn't want or need pity but he would love some friends to hang out with :(
