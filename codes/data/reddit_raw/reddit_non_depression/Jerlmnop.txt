Group of friends exclude one person and I’m now stuck I between...
So I have a group of about 13 friends, some of us have been friends most of our lives and others have joined over the past 10 years. 

One friend I’ve always be closest to went though a tough time recently and it was decided by some of the louder group members that she shouldn’t be part of the group anymore as she wasn’t making any effort and she was being a drama queen! (She definitely was not and they were all being extremely judgemental without knowing her full story) I totally disagreed with them and confronted them about it. The loud ones argued back and the others stayed quiet and a few then spoke to me privately later and said they agreed with me. There are a few that I will never again consider a friend going forward!

My dilemma is that there are still a good few in the group I enjoy spending time with and would like to remain friends with and I am also friends with the excluded friend! I feel that I either have to leave the friendship group or remain in it and stay quiet about how awfully they treated my friend and put up with the nasty few! Either way I feel awful. 

I don’t really know the purpose of this post but I don’t really have any other friends so if I break away from this group I wouldn’t have any left apart from the other excluded friend. I’m not sure they really are my friends anymore as they haven’t been there for me recently so I suspect I’d be next on the chopping block anyway.
