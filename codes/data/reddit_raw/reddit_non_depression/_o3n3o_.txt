Pissed at my wife and mother in law
We are new parents with an 8 month old baby.

Here is how my wife's day looks like:

Take care of baby, clean the dishes, do 1 laundry and cook dinner 3 times/week.

Here is how my day looks like:

I help around by taking care of the baby at least 2 hours/day so my wife can rest. Other times I work 10+ hours/day because I have a business to run or I clean up the mess my wife makes around the house. Make breakfast and lunch for all.

I just found out at our last family gathering that my mother in law said to all my relatives out loud that I don't contribute to helping my wife.

I literally lost it. Because she talked about me behind my back and I had no way to defend myself. I'm so pissed off I just want to call my monster in law and give her a pile of shit about how lazy her daughter actually is and that she only knows half the story and that she had no f'ing business talking dirt about me behind my back.
