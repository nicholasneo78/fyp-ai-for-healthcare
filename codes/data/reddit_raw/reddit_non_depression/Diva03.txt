Girl friend pregnant (lgbt)
I m a girl My girlfriend is pregnant with a male friend we used as a sperm donor. She did this 1 month after starting dating me but I stayed with her because i like her and I do like kids but now I have no feelings about this. She keeps saying I m not happy to have a baby but I m not having a baby, her and her friend are so no I m not happy, but I m not not happy. When the baby is born of course i will love and treat it like it s mine. But am I wrong for not being excited saying I m having a baby when in reality I m just the step parent.
