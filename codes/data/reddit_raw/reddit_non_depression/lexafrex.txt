How do I keep from being jealous of my very successful best friend?
So, I've been die-hard friends with this girl for about 4 years. Our friendship has been through SO MUCH during that time: the death of her father, relationships and breakups, we've worked several jobs together and lived together. We jokingly call each other "husband and wife"!

She's an artist by practice and (through her inheritance) has the ability to not have to work a full time job and simply practice art. She's getting recognized internationally and is also just started as the creative director at a local female owned bar/art house.

I am SUPER excited to see her doing all these things and I ALWAYS go to the openings of her events and show support when I can. I have traveled with her to art shows and helped set up her booth.

Recently, I've had several bad dreams about her. In one dream, I was choking her and screaming in her face. In my dream last night, I was stalking her, trying to find out if she was "cheating on me".

I think what I'm most jealous of is her freedom while I'm chained to a desk job all day.

How do I address this so that I don't end up being resentful for her success! I feel like I'm being left behind.

TL;DR I'm jealous of my successful friend and want to stop.
