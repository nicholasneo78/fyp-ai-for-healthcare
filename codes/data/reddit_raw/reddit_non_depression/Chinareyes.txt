I feel like the friendship I have is fake on her behalf
I have known this girl for going on 7 years. I am not the type of person that has many friends, or is very sociable. I try to keep to myself and mind my own business, and don’t care to hag out with people. We met at work, and I liked that there was so much that we had in common, almost like I could see myself in her. We became friends. However, there has been a few instances that make me question her friendship. 
We are both waitresses, and she would ask me how my night was and how much I made. It made me feel a bit uncomfortable, because the way she asked seemed a bit odd. If I would make more than her she would seem a little upset, if she made more, she seemed to be happy. Even now when I make more than her she says “I hate you”. She says I’m her “best friend” and gets mad if I hang out with someone else without her knowing, tag/get tagged by other people on FB, or go places without inviting her. Although, she does all of these things as well, but I don’t get upset or mention them.
When we started working at a different restaurant, right off the bat, there were people that didn’t like me. These are people that are problematic, and always cause drama (which I cannot tolerate). Well, my friend knowing that these people talked behind my back, hated me, and made up rumors about me, decided to invite on them to her house! At that moment I realized that this fakeness was not just in my mind! My friend likes a lot of attention, she gets upset when she doesn’t get it, or when I do; my friend likes to judge other people’s body’s (she’s taller 5’6”, thin); my friend sees every imperfection in others; My friend expects me to invite her out, buy her treats, bring her things to work, but she has never offered to do the same for me (although she does it for others); my friend posted 5 emojis on my fb wall on my birthday (😘🎉 🎂👭💃) I  always congratulate her and wish her well; My friend calls me her “bestie”..... how real is this friendship for her?? 
 I forgot to mention that I always try to give her Christmas/birthday presents according to what she likes(mostly earrings or pretty blouses/dresses), she rarely gives me gifts (which is fine, I don’t expect anything in return) but when she does, it’s something that has nothing to do with me (like a size large red and blue Superman-logo hoodie. I’m a size small) or a random item she finds in the clearance section...
