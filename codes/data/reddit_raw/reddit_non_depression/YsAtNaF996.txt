I feel like shit
Hello everyone and happy new lunar year! 

Here is my story: I just came back from a casino joined by my family members only, we were having a great time together and everybody were well entertained. Things were smoothly going until I committed a foul as a result of my lack of understanding about a certain kind of  gambling. Therefore, some of the participants of mine lost a small amount of their bet cash (likely because of my foul) and they said it was my fault. I was embarrassed because of my ignorance and I would have apologized each of them but I couldn't do it, I still feel I am guilty now.

Now I cannot even look at my uncle face now
