How to disown my sister
How do I remove my 18 year old sister from the family? I’m her younger brother (16) and all my life my sister has been nothing but manipulative towards my parents. The main issue is when she turns my mom and Dad against each other, resulting in her being free to do whatever while our parents scream at each other, leading to my mom crying or then separating for a few days. This isn’t the first time it’s happened, which is why I’m taking into serious consideration of kicking her out of our family. I understand my sister means a lot to me so it won’t be easy but her behavior have made my mom cry more times than I can count. Unfortunately, my parents are also very soft on her so they will not go along with me trying to disown her. 

I understand some people might think I’m a terrible person but I have lost a lot of respect for my sister where this seems to be the only Option. I appreciate all advice :)
