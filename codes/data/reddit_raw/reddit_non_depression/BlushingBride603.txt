How do you tell your kids to handle weird adults?
When I was 14, my best friend's mom started accusing me of smoking. I'd been best friends with her daughter since we were in 1st grade and I was over their house all the time. But for some reason when I was 14, she started asking. And she very low key but repeatedly accused me of smoking for about 2 more years. I had always been a straight A kid, top of my class, and a "good" kid. I had tried one cigarette when I was 13, had HATED it, and never tried another. I wasn't around anyone who smoked, no friends, no peers, no family members (immediate or extended) smoked, so there's no chance I smelled like smoke. But friend's mom persisted, and told me that she thought that I smoked because she found cigarette butts at the end of their driveway. Because obviously that couldn't have been from anyone else right?

Now in hindsight, her behavior was absolutely bizarre. As a teen, I accepted it as, she's an adult, and while I questioned her and vigorously fought back whenever she'd say something, it never occurred to me to get a sane adult involved. I'm hoping to install in my kid that they should tell me stuff like that if it ever happens. While nothing truly bad happened in my case, the lady was off her rocker, and I'm lucky nothing else happened.

How did people with older kids do that? Like I know my parents gave me the "if people are making you uncomfortable, talk to us" speech but this never made me upset, I just got angry and baffled at first, but then it kind of became this joke among all our friends and we just laughed at her. In hindsight, this could have ended very poorly for me had the mom escalated.
