are my friends shitty or am i just shitty?
for starters im a chick. my friends are a bunch of dudes. 
recently met them with a friend of mine and now they forgot about me. a cute pretty girl is of course always better than a real friend right?
any time she invites them to do stuff they're always down no matter what but when i invite them to the same thing its always a no, they're always busy, and my texts/calls/irlwords are always ignore
help me reddit. help me figure out if im a fuck up at social relationships and making friends ot if my friends just suck
