Should I let my brother live with us?
Not sure if this is the right place or if another sub is better, but here goes. I have a brother, 29, turning 30 this year, who lives with my parents. My parents sold their house and have not yet decided where to live. They are 65 and 70 and are retired. We own a small apartment building and live in it and rent the units. My parents will have some cash and also have monthly income, but my brother appears to be very depressed, may also have some untreated medical issues, and is a sober alcoholic who may be abusing prescription drugs (not pain pills, but Xanax &amp; Ativan? Not sure). He seems to sleep all day and rarely goes to his job, which is doing over other people's houses as a contractor. He owns his own truck and tools. My parents are worried they'll "lose" him when they move if he doesn't move with them, but nobody knows what to do or what his real problem(s) are.

Is it a stupid idea for us to just have everyone live in our building and subsidize my brother's "rent" by having him pay some nominal amount subject to regular psychiatry and/or other requirements? Has anyone done this? Is there another sub that is better for these types of questions? I don't know if anyone knows what to do anymore. My mom enables him but is finally making an appointment for him to see an internist, though he is very manipulative and secretive so I don't know what to do or if anything else can be done and I am somewhat concerned he will manipulate the internist--he's very deceptive. I don't even know if there's a name for what he does.
