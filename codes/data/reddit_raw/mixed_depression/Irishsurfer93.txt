I can't remember much of the last 10 years
I don't remember much of the last 10 years, since I was 12/13.

I have been prescribed some pretty strong medication to help with crippling anxiety and depression.

Xanax, diazepam, cymbalta, mirtazapine to name a few and Tramadol to help with pain management.

It feels like the last 10 years are just completely blocked out of my memory and everything is awash. My memory of my teen years is so bad that even when events are described to me I still have problems remembering them.

Does anyone else feel like they have this problem? Do anti depressants and anti anxiety medication cause memory loss?

Or could this possibly be early onset Dementia?
