All my friends have left me behind
My best friends at school got new computers that can run AAA games and it was my idea. They soon all got gta and im stuck with this laptop. After this things started going downhill. i wasnt getting added to skype calls, when i asked, they said "gta players only" and when i slipped in one time i asked "when are you guys ever going to play with me again" either they didnt say anything or said "i dont know" and then one of my friends said "we will play with you at school". I have school tommorow btw. This has occured 4 days ago and each day i have gotten more sad. I have been trying to cope for it by trying to find new friends (which i did but they live in other countries so its hard to find playtimes) and also contacting old friends. I have asked my friends each day if they wanted to play and they say idk or maybe. i dont want to kill myself but i dont want it to come to that. Thats why im reaching out here. what should i do? im so scared and confused.
