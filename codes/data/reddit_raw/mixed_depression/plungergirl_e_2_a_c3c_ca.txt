Well, I've never cut before ... I've been tempted, but I'm so afraid that someone will notice and ask questions ... I don't want to talk about it ... Instead I hit my head against hard objects (walls, desks, tables), or I dig my nails into my skin, or sometimes I bite my lips or my arms hard until they leave marks, but nothing permanent, in case someone were to notice ... I don't bang my head as much any more, but sometimes I want to ... I want to hurt myself and I don't know why, it just pops into my head ... anyone else do and / or feel similar things??
