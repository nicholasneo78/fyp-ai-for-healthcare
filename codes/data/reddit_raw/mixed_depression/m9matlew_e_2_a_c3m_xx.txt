I am currently on Zoloft - 25 mg a day, and my once high sex drive has evaporated.  I am only 24 and my boyfriend doesn't understand why the sudden complete lack of interest in sex.  It causes a lot of problems, and frankly - I feel like I'm too young to not enjoy / want sex.  The Zoloft in general helped a lot more in the beginning - now i still get quite anxious but I don't have the "head that won't turn off."  My doctor, though not excited about it, because it's a different class, has told me to start weaning off Zoloft and onto Wellbutrin.  I guess I'm nervous because I don't want to go back to feeling out of control and I was just wondering how everyone else has done comparatively, on Wellbutrin vs. Zoloft.
