Fuck everything
I have to swallow a lot of pride to let people know what a fucking mess my head is. I'm so fucking sick of everything and i feel like a child cause I'm here ranting and asking for help from a bunch of fucking children. HOW? How do you live with the pit? The darkness? The fucking typhoons of hate and hurt? I've lost both my brother and cousin to this.... I'm fucking 20 and i yet I don't know how the fuck to cope with these demons inside my very soul and they say it's home. I don't want them to have a home in me. I have picked my was off the floor a hundred fucking times.... I've had friends interupt my attempts and atm I wish they handnt because that was before botb my cousin and my brother ended it. Maybe if it had been me they would stay around the way i am because i can't do that to mom all over again. I have fought so hard to get where I am but what the fuck is the point if when i fall I fall like this every damn time? Yes... I will be happy one day.... I know it gets better.... but fuck does it get worse.... how long till the monsters inside get too big? When does The ocean of toxicitisty that is my mind swell too deep and become to tempestuous for me to swim? God i feel like I'm  a fucking clown with a sad smile that people laugh at. I try so hard to claw for life when i relapse like this but what is the fucking point? It comes back and right now I don't know if i can keep it out.... I hate the way death calls.... the way pain screams.... the void becons... And they want me.... And i hate it.... why can't I be free of it? So much time.... so many scars.... so many attempts.... what's the point?

Edit: I'm less worked up after writing that... sorry if this isn't the place or I broke the rules or whatever... but really... how? Why?
