I will never be able to take care of myself, let alone anyone else.
I physically can't find the energy to even do the most basic things, like laundry, showering, and eating. Grocery shopping is a really tiring adventure that is followed by a four hour nap. My schoolwork to rest ratio is 1:10. I can't even remember to water the singular plant that I own. They always end up dying before I even realize. 

I don't even know how I'd be able to take care of a pet, let alone any kids. It's a really good thing I don't want kids, because I'd be a terrible, neglectful mother. I'd hardly have any energy to make them food, let alone entertain them. I don't understand how people can clean and do laundry and brush their teeth every day. They're mountains to me.
