Why am I so bad at everything
I’m even bad at my own hobbies. I’ve been producing music since like sophomore year of high school and 4 years later I’m still trash. I’ve went to the gym and tried to be consistent but I’m too stupid to work out alone and even though I watch videos on  form I feel like my form is always shitty. I’m shitty at talking to people and making friends. Im losing all my friends because my depression makes me distance myself away from people in hopes of them noticing my absence but no one notices. I’m shitty at school. I’m shitty at driving. I’m shitty at talking to girls. I just prefer to lay down in bed and listen to good music that I’ll never be able to make due to my lack of standing out as a producer.
