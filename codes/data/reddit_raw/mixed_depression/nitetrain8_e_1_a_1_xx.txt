I can really relate to what a lot of you have said, in being embarrassed about seeking help. Being a teenager I don't have really have the ability to seek help on my own, and there is no way that I'm going to tell my parents. I tried hinting at it - telling them I didn't care about stuff, that I hated being around people. I even tried making it completely obvious in giving up or ignoring things I'm usually interested in, such as getting my driver's license (I'm 16, I'll get it soon). Unfortunately, she's a complete idiot and just passes everything off as being normal, somehow. Hell, once I told her flat out that I thought that 'life sucks,' and she still didn't get it! How stupid can you be?  Much of the time I feel like the biggest idiot on the face of the earth, but not even I am that dense.
