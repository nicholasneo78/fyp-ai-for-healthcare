Stop and think for a moment
It's like stumbling around in the darkness.
You can't see, you can only feel.
Blinded by the pain of reality.

You beg it to stop,
as the throbbing in your heart grows stronger.
But it's not gonna stop,
no matter how hard you beg.

Your so called 'friends' abandon You,
because your depression talk has gotten too dark.

But what's the worst part?
That you can't control it?
That you can't stop it?
Maybe it's the fact that just maybe...
just maybe you don't want It to stop.

You cling onto your pain,
because after all..it's familiar.
It's been with you for a while.

You stand upon the dark edge,
upon the highest edge you could find.

You feel the wind blow in your face.
You freeze.
All the good moments,
All the good people.
It all comes in floods of part nostalgy and part regret.

What took you to this edge?
What made you so desperate,
To take such drastic action?

While the pain is temporary,
This thing you're about to do - 
It's permanent.

Stop and think for a moment.
Because no matter how long a storm lasts,
You still enjoy the rain...
You still love the sound of thunder.
