Drowning in a sea of sadness
When will life ever get better? Everyday just seems to get worse. I struggle to find any meaning in the things I do because they all seem to be worthless. I'm already losing my will to live.  The anxieties, loneliness, and insecurities are all suffocating me.  I just want this suffering to end.  But, somehow, I can never save myself from drowning in this sea of depression.
