I am new here.  Decided to look up some info on the withdrawal effect of Effexor and decided that it was time to check out support as well.  I have suffered from depression since I was very young but was not diagnosed until my early twenties (I am 33 now)  I was not medicated until my husband decided he didn't want to be married anymore and the bottom fell out of my life.  At the time I needed something to help balance me out a bit.  I should have been medicated a long time ago :)  I still have times where it hits me but not nearly as severe as it used to.  I describe it as my black cloud coming over me.  I tell people when it's there as I am very open about my depression as I feel it may help someone else.
