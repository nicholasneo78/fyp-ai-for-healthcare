Call me Mrs. Self-Destruction
Everything I do is wrong. I was given every advantage in life: intelligence, compassion, athleticism, even looks. I have spent the last 11 years (since 15) sabotaging my own success. I'm now  in full self-destruct mode.


No anti-depressant works for me. Every medication makes me miserable and sick unless it is a stimulant, and I don't want to be stuck on stimulants. I used to drink as a crutch and now I can't.


My husband and I were separated and moved back in together. He is an addict too and going through withdrawal, so he is extra-sensitive. My ex decided that it would be a great time to blackmail me with Facebook statuses and tag my husband in them. I didn't tell my spouse about the blackmail because of the potential fallout, because things were finally good. Now I realize I just hurt him worse. Needless to say... he is pissed. It just makes things worse. 


I have no motivation at work. Therapy is not working and I need a new therapist, but I don't have the energy or self-love to care enough to do anything about my issues. I am in a black hole when everyone thinks I live a charmed life. I have been depressed since I was five years old and I don't know how long I can hold on without losing it.

What do I even do? I'm withdrawing from stims myself, and I feel completely useless and hopeless. I'm too lazy to be suicidal these days, but I don't enjoy life anymore. I cry all the time. I live in my head. I don't know what I can gain from posting here, but someone... please help.
