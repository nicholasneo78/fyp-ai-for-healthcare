I think for me some of the major issues affecting my depression are happiness, motivation and isolation...I'm not really sure which came first, but I voted motivation, as I don't seem to have any! I can't remember the last time I truly felt 'happy' either - I think it was probably about 5 or 6 years ago when I was in college, had a great social life and thought I was with a great guy :-/ Socially, I find it very difficult to stay in touch with people because I'm paranoid that they don't really want to hear from me. I lost touch with friends when I moved to college, and then lost friends when I moved back to my home town. Now I have very few friends, and feel the ones I do have don't really care too much about me. I hate sounding like I'm feeling sorry for myself, but it's hard to explain...
