There are so many things I want to say to people, things I want to type...
But in the end, no matter how much of that text I wrote or how much I think about what to say, I delete it in the end. 

I'm sure I'm not alone in this regard, but I feel like 90% of all potential comments and posts on reddit I make are deleted before I post them. 

"Somebody else probably said it already." 

"Nobody cares what I have to say anyway." 

Just things like that. Lots more too, but I'm just going to post this now while I still have the nerve to do it.
