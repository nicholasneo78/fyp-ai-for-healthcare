When people surrounding you keep thinking that you’re trying to act cool over your mental illness.
I’m depressed. And those people around me always think that I’m just trying to act deeply, or being cool. They ask me to become “normal” but I still don’t get what kind of “normal” that they mean. Depression is not cool, it’s not a lifestyle, why people keep assuming me of hating them just because I don’t enjoy making fun and telling them stories?
