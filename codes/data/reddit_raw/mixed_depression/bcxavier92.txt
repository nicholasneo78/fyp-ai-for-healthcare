I feel like nothing matters, so why try?
Hey guys, I've decided to turn to reddit to try to get some help with my lack of motivation.

Recently I've felt like nothing matters in the end, and nothing I do makes a difference. We're on a random rock floating through space in a universe thats bigger than we could ever fathom and we don't understand, and we think that things that we do matter.

I feel like I've heard "just because nothing matters doesn't mean you can't be happy" a thousand times, and while it sounds good, I can't get passed my negative view on things. I honestly wish that I thought that way, but that's not how I think.

I guess I posted this to try to get different perspective. If anyone has gone through the same thing, could you let me know how you changed your outlook on life?
