Reddit Secret Santa Saved My Life...
I want to begin this by saying that I've been in a really dark place recently. Combination of family issues, breakup, and finals put me in a really depressive state. As a result, I'd been having strong suicidal thoughts for weeks. I had been seriously thinking about ending my own life. So that's the context in which this occurs. 

About a month ago I signed up for secret santa on a whim. I had never done it before and honestly didn't expect anything. But yesterday, my gift arrived. I don't know who this person is, but they spent at least $150 dollars on about 6 separate gifts. They also included a really thoughtful and touching letter that talked about how they thought I was such a great person and how much they enjoyed learning about me. 

I immediately broke down crying upon reading it. 

It might seem small or sorta stupid, but it made me feel like someone cared about me. That I wasn't the idiotic nobody my depression tells me I am all of the time. I felt motivated and happy for the first time in weeks. I cleaned my room and did work that I'd been ignoring for months. I finally felt like maybe, just maybe, I meant something. 

It changed my life, and probably saved it. 

So whoever you are, thank you so much, and I can't express how much this meant to me or thank you enough. 

And let this be a lesson to everyone else. The smallest act can and does make a difference. Let's all try and use the Christmas season to ensure everyone feels a little more loved.
