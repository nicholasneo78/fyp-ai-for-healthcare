My Daughter turned 30 today.  I called and sent her a card, but she is not speaking to me.  Reason being ...
I've helped her and her husband financially for approximately 2  years with the child care payment for my lovely grand daughter (she is 3 years old).
I explained to both of them (daughter and her husband), that I'd have to quit paying half the payment (273.00 per month), after I get my 2005 tax return, because I'm planning on buying a new car.  I need a smaller car, and the one I own is from 1995 SUV.  I gave my older car to my nephew in Arizona.  He was driving a 1985 Toyota with no air conditioning.  He is thrilled to recieved my 1995 Passport (Honda), that has many miles, but no serious problems.
I was babysitting my lovely granddaughter one Saturday night.  When they came home from a party.
 My son in law stunk of weed and he was drunk.  He was hugging his daughter (my granddaughter), while he was stoned and drunk.  I was so disappointed.  I come from the old school that pot is bad.
Being that my daughter was promoted to full time, and they both received a total of 2,000.00 tax return, I figure this is a good time to let them know that I'll no longer be paying for half their child care.
My daughter blames my decision on the night her husband was very stoned ... I tell her that I can't expect "the best" for my granddaughter, when her own father doesn't care, as much as I do.  Plus, I had forewarned her that I'll be buying a car soon.  So ... now I have a new car .. but no daughter, and not granddaughter.  None of them are speaking to me. 
I miss my daughter so much, and my granddaughter even more.
please advise.
