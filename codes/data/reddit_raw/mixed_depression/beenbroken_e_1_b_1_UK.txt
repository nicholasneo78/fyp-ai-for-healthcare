Lunch yesterday in a busy city-centre bar. Full of lawyers drinking wine n expensive suits, folders of documents n brief snippets of conversations waft past me. there were 17 indictments on the file…” Gales of laughter, ice buckets, steak sandwiches, bowls of pasta. I sat in a free space a couple of seats away from a young woman and waited for my food, downing bitter shandy in the heat. I then became aware that my neighbor was conducting a continuous conversation with herself. At first I thought she was talking to me, and turned to look, caught her eye, and realized. Her conversation, mostly murmured, not at all intrusive, continued throughout the hour or so I spent there, always addressed to herself alone, or to a figure I could not see. Every so often she went to the bar and came back with another tall glass of lemonade - or perhaps it was fizzy water. As she talked she made small jerky gesticulations with her arms in front of her; I could not hear what she was talking about n her speech was less loud than the noise from the crowded tables in the centre of the room n but the tone and volume of her conversation rose and fell; there was a sense of excitement at times, then of humor, sometimes of irritation, sometimes of the mundanity of everyday speech. The bar staff seemed to know her n one of them, a tall boy with a goatee came and chatted to her briefly. I finished my food n which was not that great n read the paper, drank another beer, occasionally watched the lawyers, ruminated, day-dreamed, and then left. My neighbor stayed on, still talking, still sipping her lemonade.
