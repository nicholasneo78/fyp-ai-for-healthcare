Well I bought the TENS machine. got it set up earlier and decided I was in SO much pain across my shoulders that I would set it at the neck shoulder setting and on the MOST intense setting due to the pain and the desperation I was feeling. Well that was a mistake it's like being stabbed with a pointy stick - so I reset it to the minimum setting. it has helped a little perhaps I should use it more often to a) get used to the feeling b) get rid of the pain as I am in LESS pain now but it hasn't gone altogether would I recommend one let's just say I need a few more days to decide but for now I am in slightly less pain than I was
