Who am I?
I feel like I don't have any defining personality. I'm either the shy person who gets on with what their doing, the social guy who wants to be friends with everyone, the autistic piece of shite nobody likes or just the normal guy. All of those personalities are just fakes, I know that, but underneath that, who am I?
