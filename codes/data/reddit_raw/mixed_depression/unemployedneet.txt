Am I depressed or just self-pitying?
I don't really understand what counts as depression but I've had no motivation to really do anything since as long as I can remember. Sometimes I get a burst of motivation and try to do something but I give up really easily. It's really easy to say that I'm depressed as an excuse for the way I feel but I'm still able to function so I don't think I can say I am. I still shower, eat, go to work, even the gym sometimes.
I'm not really close with my family, I rarely talk to them and its only when they talk to me and I'm okay with that since I don't really feel like I want to or could hold a conversation with them. Friends I have, I hang out with them sometimes but half the time it feels like a lot of work. I have a girlfriend and I cling to her so hard because I'm so happy when I'm with her and when I'm not with her I'm always thinking of her and get sad that I'm not with her. She recently told me that the way I think of relationships is immature and she cant offer that much time to me since she has other friends who need her too and get mad at her for not soending enough time with them. I can't let go of the way I think relatiomships should be and I want her to reciprocate even if I know it's irrational and I don't feel like anything else in life is really worth living for. I'm not suicidal though, there's a few times it crossed my mind but I always think about how I wouldn't really ever do it or start regretting it while thinking about it because what if things do get better? Other times I feel like going to sleep one night and not waking up would be nice though.
