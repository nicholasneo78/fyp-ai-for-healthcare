Birthdays are the hardest time for me
Every year relatives call me and every year same old convo. Anyone special in your life? Any closer to getting married. And I know it stupid but it kills me every time. Because I'm not and every year I reflect on spending another year of existence alone and only have another year of loneliness to look forward to. I've tried to immerse myself in hobbies like movies. Focus all my energy on school or working out but I guess some voids are too large to fill.
