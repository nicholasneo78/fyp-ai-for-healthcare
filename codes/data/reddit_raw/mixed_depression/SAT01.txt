Closer to suicide than I've ever been before
I planned on doing it yesterday after school, but I couldn't because people were home. I feel like I would've had they not been there. I decided to take the day off today just to chill out. I don't think I'll have much longer. Even this community sucks. The most up-voted posts are always the most shallow ones like, 'Does anyone else sleep a lot?' Or something along those lines, and the people who actually need help never get it.

Fuck life
