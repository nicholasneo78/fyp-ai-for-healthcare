Not so tired anymore. Left work at eight, didn't do the late night. I couldn't, I still felt a little ill, felt a bit dizzy around seven Never a good sign. So I went home to find that two TV shows are trying to kill me. I watched the finales of Small Ville and Bones and bloody ‘ell. I love Bones. I'm not enjoying Cold Case anymore. It's just getting same and boring. I might have to stop watching it. Stop watching a TV show! Oh the horror! I'm getting a tattoo tomorrow, a star and rainbow combo on my left shoulder/back area. That's really vague isn't it. When I get it done I will take a photo and everything will be cleared up. I'm having it done in another new tattoo parlor. New to me anyway. The three I have at the moment have all been done by different blokes in different shops. What else? Nothing really. I love my new camera, it's a Fujifilm E900. It's pretty strong so I can run around and shake it and it should be okay. Should be, I have a tendency to break stuff. For my sins I'm on the fourth Harry Potter book now. I read the third in a day and I'm over half way through this way. What's worse is that I'm really enjoying them, though, it's nice just to be reading again. It's so hard to read nowadays and this is a good sign for me.
