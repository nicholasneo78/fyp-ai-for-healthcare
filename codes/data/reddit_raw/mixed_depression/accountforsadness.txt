I have no friends
This isn’t an over dramatic statement. I truly have no friends. 

Throughout the years I’ve grown a part from people and I’ve distanced myself from people I felt were toxic. I’ve had my heart broken by a few friends. But right now I’m sitting here looking at this funny meme I wanted to share and I realized I have no one to send it to. I hope all of this makes sense one day. Goodnight

Edit: Wow, I did not expect this response! It’s comforting to know I am not alone. We’re all in this together &amp; I feel happy to know I am a part of a sub with so many caring, kind people. If any of you need a friend or just need someone to talk to, I’m here.

Thank you all for sharing your stories and responding. The meme is quite funny, I’m going to try to send it to everyone who asked. Cheers
