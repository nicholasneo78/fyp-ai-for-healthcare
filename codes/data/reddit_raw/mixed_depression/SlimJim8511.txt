Anyone ever look back at their younger years and wonder how they used to be such a joyful person?
I saw a post on here about someone remembering a feeling of emptiness since they were five and just not knowing it was depression.  For me it's the opposite.  I was always a super joyful kid, and maybe a little too hyper.  (I was that annoying kid when I was 10-11).  Then around seventh grade I started to withdrawal from the world slightly, and just talked a little less than average.  This seemed all fine at the time, it made me a more likable person.  But I think that was the beginning.  I finally realized my lack of a friend group because of how I acted when I was younger during third quarter that year.  It wasn't bad depression, but it only got worse from there.  My Dad turned from mean to abusive starting next year, and my mom started to be disappointed with everything I do.  My parents don't even know anything about me besides a few keywords because they haven't held a conversation with me since I was 11.  The only person who I can say genuinely cares for me is my best friend, and he doesn't even know I am depressed.  I don't see a reason why I am, so why should I explain that to someone who is much more depressed than I am?  By the time I turned 14 I can say I was depressed.  "Functionally depressed" I guess, using terminology from one of the top posts here.  I don't know what to do.
