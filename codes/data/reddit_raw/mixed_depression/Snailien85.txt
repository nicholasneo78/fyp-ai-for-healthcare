Do i need a high education to succeed in life?
Do i really need a high education, maybe even an university degree to make much money, and don't live in poverty? if no, how can i become successfull even with low education? Or is that impossible? How can i become sucessfull and avoid poverty even with a low education? Because it makes me scared of the future and depressed. What should i do?
