I’m drunk and lonely, and
and my family is worried about me. They are so loving. But I can’t connect with them. I have a kinda-sorta girlfriend. She is very nice, but we get doubts about each other. I have a good job, but I don’t perform well in it. I drink multiple times every week. It’s usually not such strong drink, but yet it is bad. I have paid for sex in the past (didn’t work). I’m somebody who is so inspired but so tired of constant deafening nature of life. I’m tired. I am hurting or disappointing everyone. What should I do?
