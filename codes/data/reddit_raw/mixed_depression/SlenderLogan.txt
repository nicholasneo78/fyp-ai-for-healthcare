About to end it all, change my mind
In about an hour I'll be home alone for a while so that's when I'm planning to do it. Not my first attempt, but more preparation has gone into this than before. I've got the noose ready and I know where I'm putting it up.

I can't talk myself out of it, but I feel I should give life a chance. I'm in such a shitty spot and I don't want to do this anymore, but if any of you have been talked out of a state like this before and feel like you can help me out, shoot me a message or comment.

Edit: I'm not okay but I'm more safe now, thank you everyone.
