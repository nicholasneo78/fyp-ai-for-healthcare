I'm 19 and I go to school full - time (or try to) and work part - time. I usually end up having a breakdown sometime during the middle of the semester and have to drop either all or most of my classes. In two years I've only completed 27 credits and I feel like a total failure. I struggle through the semester even when the classes are not that difficult. I just have a hard time focusing, concentrating and simply maintaining an interest in my classes. I just feel like an idiot and a failure sometimes because others my age are so much further along than me and I feel if I could just make myself focus more, I would be too. When I am able to concentrate, I do well but it's so rare that I am able to concentrate. On top of all that, I hate my job. It fills me with dread anytime I even think about having to go. I just feel overwhelmed sometimes and I feel like I'm not going to amount to anything in life. I started medications at the end of May but so far they haven't kicked in yet. Is anyone else having this problem with school??
