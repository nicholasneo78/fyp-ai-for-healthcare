Mum's questions are relentless
My mum is always asking me 'How is blahblah from high school?' 'Are you meeting up with blahblahblah this winter?' 'Have you spoken to blahblooh?' 

No mum. None of them want to know me. They ignore me, don't reply to my messages and don't want to meet up. 

It's embarrassing having to explain it all the time.
