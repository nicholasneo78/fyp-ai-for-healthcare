Anyone else just get set off into a spiral of bad thoughts from simple things like daydreams or a text from someone that seems like they’re irritated at you?
I start spiraling out of control into these negatives thoughts so often from even the smallest daydream that immediately turns corrupted. I was in a good mood working today and suddenly I daydreamed about the wrong things and now I feel so heavy it’s hard to work. I clocked out early just to get away and get into bed and I don’t know what to do. How do you guys handle overthinking? just typing this out makes me feel better but what kind of exercises or routines can I use to just calm myself..?

EDIT:You guys are amazing. Thank you, I’ve taken all your advice into account. I appreciate it all.
