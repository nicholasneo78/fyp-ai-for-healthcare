I always feel like I will never achieve my dreams and I am a failure.
I have a big dream where I want to help people in those poor countries and volunteer in charity works. The issue that really concern me at the moment is child labor. I hate to see children working to earn money and live in poverty when they are supposed to learn and enjoy their childhood. 

Another dream of mine is to pursue in the post graduate program after finish my degree. That is very difficult for me as I need a good GPA to get the financial loan. I think I didnt do well in my study at the moment. I dont think I am able to continue my study in master program. 

I always hate myself because I feel like I lack a lot of thing. I have a social anxiety where I love being alone, I feel nervous when talking with someone else. I avoided my highschool friends because I think I cant fit well. I am afraid to talk in front of the crowd, I am not able to express myself well. I hate that I am incapable to defend myself sometimes. I feel self loathing. I wake up every morning feeling the same thing, feel I will never accomplish anything. I see some of my friends are married, have their own cars and good jobs. I am stuck here and doing nothing. I cant be pretty like them and I dont have money. That is it my life.
