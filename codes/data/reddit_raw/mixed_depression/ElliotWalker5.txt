I'm posting because i need to scream. I cut because i need to hide.
i drunk and cut my head. i dont know how i'll explain. fell over i think. got in a fight maybe. no one would fight me, but i cut my head somehow. i fell and hit a kerb. no one needs to know - no one will care. i need to be more careful of kerbs. when i drink it doesnt hurt - i dont need to drink - im at university i have to - the pressure is too much. so many thoughts - i didnt need this - i didnt need to explain to people but i have to. i have to cancel other plans - how can i explain a cut across my head. this is my fault. no one elses.
