Ready to just say "fuck it"
I can't take it anymore. I'm an atheist democrat living in a family of hardcore christian conservatives. Ive made it clear that Im a democrat, to which they just call me a snowflake all the time, which just makes me resent them even more. I dont dare tell them Im am atheist, but Im thinking about it. I dont have anything to live for anymore. 

I dont have any idea what to do with my life. I dont have any special talent or skills. The only hobby I really have is video games, but Im horrible at those. I've raged so hard at Battlefield that I broke down in tears and drooled everywhere, and anytime I play an RPG I restart so many times that it makes me not want to play anymore. 

All my friends have at least an idea of what they want to do, but I dont even have the beginnings of a clue as to what I want to do with the rest of my life. And to be honest, Im scared of becoming an adult. Managing a budget, doing taxes, paying bills, and shit like that. Im not fucking prepared for it. If I cant deal with the stress of a fucking video game, then I sure as hell cant deal with a job. 

My parents are also hounding me to get a girlfriend. I dont even have a friend who is a girl. All my close friends are male. Hell, the closest Ive came to having a full conversation with a girl is helping her with spanish homework. I aint gay, I just cant talk to girls. The social anxiety makes me want to vomit if I even think about approaching a girl. 

So Im ready to fuck it all and just tell my parents Im an atheist.  Let them send me to whatever fucking counseling they want. Let them disown me and have to go live with a friend. I have no future other than a goddamn walmart greeter at this point
