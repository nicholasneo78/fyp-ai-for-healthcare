Been medically diagnosed with depression
I haven't been feeling the best physically lately dizziness, etc and I'm generally quite fit and healthy.  I've been wanting not to do anything besides be at home with friends for while, my ex dumped me cause I would find it unpleasant to go outside of the house. But I don't feel sad at all. I don't feel worked at all I just feel like everything is going at 10x speed.
