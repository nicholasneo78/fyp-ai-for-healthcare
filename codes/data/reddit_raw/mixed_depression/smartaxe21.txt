isnt it kind of crazy when people who actually are not clinically depressed say they want to die or are depressed for fun, when you are really dealing with those feelings for real?
There are people at my work place who clearly are not clinically depressed but tag and share memes like they are lonely or depressed or just say they want to die in a funny way, when everyday is a huge challenge for me in terms of forcing myself to be alive and conform to the societal norms. This usually never gets to me because many people dont actually get what it means to be depressed. Even depressed people experience things in a spectrum. However, when I feel like I am falling off the wagon and I see these seemingly normal treat suicidal thoughts/coping mechanisms of genuinely depressed people/melancholy as fun memes and have a good laugh when all those things are part my own personal hell, I just go completely bonkers and I do not really know why. 

Anyone else feel like this ? 

Sorry for terrible punctuation.
