Holiday season
I have pretty bad depression as it is but when the holidays come around it’s worse. I have a lot of trauma from the holidays as kid involving some shit with my family. I tried to tell my girlfriend but she gets mad at me for “being negative” and that it’s “immature”. How can I try and seem cheerful around this time of year when it’s literally the worst time of the year for me?
