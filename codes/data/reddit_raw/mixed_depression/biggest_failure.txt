Advice on where to post for advice on taking antidepressants.
Hi, UK based poster - I've recently taken my Doctors advice and got a prescription for antidepressants. I've been in-and-out of various states of mild to severe depression throughout my teens &amp; twenties, but I've always figured this is just something everyone has to deal with at some stage or another, so I've never sought help even when falling off a proverbial cliff edge. After much deliberation, someone I care deeply about got me to try counselling, but I find that I'm really not getting much out of it right now, as I don't have the will to try, and my focus is all over the place (I'm being tested for ADHD too, but I'm still awaiting the results). My Doctor suggested trying a combination of antidepressants and CBT (the latter of which I am currently attempting to source a support group for), however I have an underlying phobia of long-term medication after seeing several people close to me, use it as a crutch and just become something wholly unfamiliar to me as a result. I've been prescribed Citalopram (Celexa for those stateside) but like I said - I have deep-seated reservations about taking them and before I tried, I wanted to see if there was anywhere/anyone I could talk to about their experiences on the drug and any perhaps any suggestions they could offer about managing short-term (6-9 months) antidepressant medication? I've looked at the sub-reddit rules for this group and I'm not sure if this crosses rule 3; if so, can someone help me find the right place to ask my question(s)?
