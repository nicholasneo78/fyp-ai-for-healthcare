After struggling more than a year I finally cut off all contact with my crush
I deleted her from every friendlist, unfollowed her everywhere and basically removed her from my life after years of friendship.

I just couldn't deal with it anymore. Loving her is one of the reasons I am as miserable as I am right now and as stupid as it sounds, one of the reasons I think about suicide daily just because I can't get her out of my head.

I hope it helps and I hope she'll never get in touch with me and asks what's going on.

I just want to forget her.
