I want to kill myself a lot these days
I’m just so disconnected from everything and everyone. I can’t meet new people, and it is making me hate my life. The only girls I meet are through work, and I’d rather keep these relationships professional. Girls I meet other ways never last, and I don’t know how to stop talking to them. I’m always holding onto the shred of hope that we will pick up where we left off, when I know this isn’t going to happen. 

I can’t let go of the relationships that didn’t work because I am unable to create new ones. 

I’m alone as I’ve ever been. I can’t even have guy friends because I’m bad with competition. I don’t even realize it, it’s all subconscious. I’m an asshole and I’ve just been a dick to people who just don’t deserve it. I’ve been so selfish. 

I guess I can be happy that I’ve started to make changes. They say change your habits and your mind will follow. Well I’ve improved my habits greatly over the past year, so why am I still a piece of shit. Why am I still unable to let go of the failed relationships. Why am I unable to move forward from all this.
