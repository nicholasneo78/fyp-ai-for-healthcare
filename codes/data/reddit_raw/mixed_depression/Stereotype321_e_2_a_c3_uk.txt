I feel sad. It is 1.46 am and I haven't gone to bed yet. Instead I am sitting here at the computer half heartedly trying to be part of the chat room, tears falling down my face. I feel so sad I can't even be bothered to reach for my phone to remove the razor from the back, or go down stairs for a bottle of wine. It makes me feel worse that this is been going on for so long that even the pathetic depressive coping skills have no effect on me. Pure pessimism, not even the chance of some temporary relief through an OD or spilt blood. Why did they seem to offer relief 3, 5, 6 years ago? I tried to eat normally today, I really tried. I failed though. I am trying to see myself properly, or at least come to the realization that I am not vile and unattractive, and obese. It still ends up with food all over the toilet. I disgust myself so much. I disgust myself because I let myself eat. I disgust myself because I think as I do, and I know that eating should be considered normal, but I can't see it like that. I disgust myself because I covered the toilet bowl in bits of chewed up food and stomach acid. I don't know what to say any more. I wish some one would say that I am going to feel better, but I've had that for the last 7 years, and I'd probably just be cynical any way. This post was pathetic, I'm sorry. Ruth
