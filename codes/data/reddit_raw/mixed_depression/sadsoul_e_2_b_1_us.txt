Medicines can and do stop working. I am going though this right now. I suffer from chronic depression. Had it since I was 5 and I am now 42 so I have been suffering for 37 years. God, I never realized how long it was! I sat in therapy for 4 years after my ex attempted to hang himself. I saved his life by taking him down from the noose with the help of my brother. The first words out of his mouth when he was out of his coma and the swelling went down was that it was all my fault. I knew then it was ME who needed the help. So for 4 years I sat in therapy and they never diagnosed me with chronic depression. If they did, they never told me or put me on medicines. When I switched therapists, that was when she said that I needed medicines. They gave me Prozac. That made a HUGE difference after the first 3 weeks. I took that for 6 years. Then I had gastric bypass surgery and when you have that, your body doesn't absorb the same so it stopped working. I took effexor for a while, did nothing, and now on celexa which is doing nothing at all. I am sitting here reading this forum and crying. So basically, medicines CAN stop working. Time to go get an adjustment.
