I am always wrong..
I got married with a wrong man.  I have been married for 5 years. I have a baby who is still a month. I realized that i chose the wrong person as husband. He ruined my life. He ruined my inside. He cheats on me while i was pregnant. But he does not think he did bad things to me. When i said something, he always says that I'm stupid or crazy. He thinks he's right. Since last year, we moved to his country and living with his mother and sister. Because he works there.
His family are nice to me. But my husband doesn't come back every day.. I have a baby but he doesn't support me. I haven't realized he's such a bad man.. He has hidden so many things from me.. So i thought he's a good husband. But he brought financial issues. And i have helped it. But he forgot that.. I want to leave him but i don't have money and i have a baby.. And I'm in different country.. No one is by my side. I cut myself almost every day. I have stopped it since i was 20. But situations make me do that. I would never wear short sleeve again. Too much scars. But i don't regret to cut myself. Because that's the only way to make me live. Maybe people say easy that i should get a divorce or just leave him or ask my family. But that's not easy.  I have tried to end my life many times after i moved here. But I'm failed. I hope one day i can be gone. Life is so unfair. I don't want to live this life anymore. I want someone to kill me..
