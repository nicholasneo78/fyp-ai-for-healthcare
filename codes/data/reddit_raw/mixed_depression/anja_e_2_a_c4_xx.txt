I'm a 23 year old female who has suffered from depression for the last 3 years. I remember having bouts of it in high school, hating myself and thinking i was ugly and worthless, but it generally passed and things got better. Then all of a sudden when i was 20, i just started crying constantly, feeling out of control, wanting to dig a hole and bury myself, not knowing what to do with myself, feeling hysterical. I went on medication after a few months, and things improved, but it's something i still deal with every day.

I am at university full time, as well as working part time, and just feel like i'm constantly on the edge of going insane. I just moved to a new city, and feel so lonely, wanting attention but i feel like no one's interested. Worst of all, i miss so much university (because i can't get out of bed in the morning) that my tutors regard me as a bad student, which makes me feel so bad, because i know i'm smarter than most of the people in our class. I just want everyone to know i'm not lazy and boring, i just feel like my body is made of lead and i have no energy and no drive to get up in the morning. I have just started seeing a psychologist and she is really great, but it's so expensive i have to work extra shifts at work just to manage, which makes me even more stressed out!

I don't want to take time off university because i took last year off and it made me feel worse. I really love my course and it's pretty much the only thing that gives me joy ...  if only i could get out of bed to go!

i'm so angry at myself, my life wasn't meant to be like this...
