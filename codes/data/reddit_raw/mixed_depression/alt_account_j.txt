I just took a shower for the first time in 2 weeks, and I just washed my hair for the first time in months.
I know that's absolutely disgusting, but Depression has made me lose all will to do anything, and that includes hygiene. I know it's pathetic to be proud of myself for doing something normal people do every day, but I can't help but feel happy about myself.
