do most ppl live a healthy happy normal life???
I been depressed since I was a teenager. which means, I been depressed for majority of my life.

Are most ppl happy? do they live a good normal lifestyle? I stopped enjoying the simple things, such as music, movies, going on vacation or just doing things in general. Everything feels so pointless.
