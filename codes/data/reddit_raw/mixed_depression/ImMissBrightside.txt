Anyone else stay up all night on their phone in bed because it feels like no time is being lost?
All the time during the day, I feel like I'm wasting time, wasting my life, doing nothing, going nowhere. But at night, it's timeless. I guess I think these hours would've been lost to sleep anyways so I'm not losing anything at all. 

I feel like if I could stay in this night forever, I'll never have to wake up to reality again.
