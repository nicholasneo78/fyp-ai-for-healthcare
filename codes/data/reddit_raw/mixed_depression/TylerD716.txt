Realizations/habits I have. Anyone else?
•Talking for too long about something no one cares about. 
•Oversharing my problems when people ask why I'm always upset. 
-Or a reluctance to talk about my problems to someone that actually cares because no one else does. 
•Making unnecessary expensive purchases to temporarily pad my self esteem. 
•Making radical changes to my appearance to seem in control of my life. 
•Oversharing on social media (being too depressing). 
•Waiting for someone to start a conversation with me or initiate a friendship rather than the other way around 
•Feeling entitled to people's time and attention when I hardly give people mine.
•Either oversleeping or hardly sleeping at all.
