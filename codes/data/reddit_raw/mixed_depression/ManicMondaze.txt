Music to uplift?
Okay, Reddit, I'm having a really rough 6 months. I keep thinking the fog will lift any day now but it just sits there blurring the line between myself and the things I once enjoyed. Maybe some music would help. Is there anything out there that you've listened to to help you feel happier? I guess the moody shit I've been listening to nonstop probably isn't doing me any favors. :)
