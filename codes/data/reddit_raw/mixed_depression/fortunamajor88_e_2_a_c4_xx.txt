I was first officially diagnosed as depressed when I was twelve, and had been depressed for two or three years before that, following the death of my younger sister. It took six years before I found an effective medication. During the time I was depressed, I was completely antisocial, had no friends, and was completely oblivious to the outside world. Now I'm eighteen, and I feel like I've missed a decade of social development. I have no friends, and no idea how to make any. It's all well and good to say just be friendly, but I don't know what that means! I can't make small talk, because I have no understanding of fashion, boys, make up, any of the things girls my age are meant to talk about, if that is what they're meant to talk about. Most of the things I know about other people my age I get from books and television, and I have no idea how accurate they are.

Please, I really need help. I've just started attending a 'normal' school (as opposed to a hospital school) for the first time since 8th grade, and I'd like to have friends, I just don't know how to go about it.
