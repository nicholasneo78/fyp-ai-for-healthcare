Can we talk about comments for a minute
This subreddit has helped me so much and it has helped thousands of people just the same. It is supposed to be a place of understanding and help, but when I see comments saying "tough luck" "boo hoo poor me" or anything of the sort I just infuriates me to the extreme. If you're not here to help or be helped then simply leave, this community is for helping those in need, not for trolling or for laughing at. It's seriously sick that people would be so cruel to others when they didn't ask for anything but help. If you're not here to help, leave, simple as that.
