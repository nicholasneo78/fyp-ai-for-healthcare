Life huh
some people are born without any luck , here is proof : 
 
* born 28 years ago.
* mother : prostitute till she died , got pregnant while she was 
   doing her clients , died when i was 17 on cancer
* father : since she is a prostitute , no idea 
* stephdad : abused me till 13 years old. got sex with 
   animals/children , still free on lack of evidence and there is no 
   specific help for this “mentaly illness” and there is no space in 
   prison … im not joking, this is how it works in my country
* life : child protection agency took me away when i was 2
* lovelife : some light in my life ... knew her since i was 10 and fall in love  , started 
   dating her at 16 till she died when i was 22
* work : putting a mask everyday.... working for food and paying 
   rent
* social : nothing but staring at a screen and masterbating

**"Life is a gift "** , yeah right ....
