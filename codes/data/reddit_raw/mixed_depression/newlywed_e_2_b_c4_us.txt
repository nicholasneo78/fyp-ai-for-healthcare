I am 30 years old and have lived with depression/dysthymia my whole life. I am going on one year of marriage to the most wonderful man ever. I've always wanted children until recently. I'm going through yet another depressive spell where I can barely function and come home after a high-powered job with headaches and complete mental exhaustion. I barely have enough for me, and even less for my husband! How could I handle a baby? It's pretty much inevitable I will have post-partum. When I thought about adoption I realized that I'd still be primary caretaker for a child and what if I can't be "there" for the child? I am SO ANGRY that this "condition" hinders so much in my life. Anyone else struggle with this?
