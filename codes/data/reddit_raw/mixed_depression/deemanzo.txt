Anyone else read books as a form of escapism?
I know for some people depression can be so crippling that you can’t even find the motivation to pick up a book let alone focus long enough to read it. That used to be me although I’ve always been interested in reading and loved it until my depression became that crippling. But since getting put on adderall for my ADD, I’m able to get back into reading books. Mostly fantasy books

It helps me literally be in another world for a while and forget about my problems for a while and feel like I’m living another life for a while. It’s not a cure obviously for depression but it does seem to help me a little temporarily.  

Anyone else have a reading habit or have found reading to be helpful in this way ?? And if so, what do you like to read ?
