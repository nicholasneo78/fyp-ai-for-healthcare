I'm a 17 year old female from Ontario. When I was 12, my mom's boyfriend at the time raped me for six months every time I was there. When my dad finally got wind of the situation, my mom's boyfriend was taken to court and charged with molestation. I didn't attend the trial. I recently found out that molestation is only "unwanted touching" as my friend told me, and wouldn't have included most of what happened. I recently asked my mom what was brought up in court, and it was only 6 counts of molestation, meaning, they only knew of 6 different times where he had touched me and included nothing of what I went through. I now suffer from ptsd. due to it. I have never spoken to anyone about it before. I don't know how to deal with the sense of loss I feel about the situation. I now cut because of it and have terrible nightmares. I avoid being in most relationships because I don't want to tell my lover that I am not a virgin for them because I don't want to talk about what happened because I'm afraid that that will ruin our relationship. I just need some one to talk to ...
