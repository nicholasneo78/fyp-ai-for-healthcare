Our teacher made us read about a child that invented a lead detection device. Meanwhile I'm failing classes.
I don't know how to write this. I feel like shit. I'm in class. I cannot focus now. Gee, thanks, teacher! Even though I even said it out loud and personally told you, you STILL INSIST on making me feel like shit. Giving me a C because I didn't do one assignment is not enough, is it? You NEED to do this to me? That girl JUST HAPPENED to research on how to build the thing from the MIT website, meanwhile I cannot even think about going to my dream school (MIT) because I'm too scared! 

Fuck you, royally, teacher.
