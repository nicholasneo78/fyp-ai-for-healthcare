college- medical withdrawal for a semester
Okay, so I'm thinking about either doing a course load reduction or a medical withdrawal due to my anxiety and depression. I've already contacted my academic advisor and the financial aid office, but I honestly have no idea whether everything will work out or not. If I manage to get a course load reduction, does anyone have any ideas for things I can do to help myself get better during this semester? If it ends up not working out, does anyone know about other ways I can go about making this semester less stressful?

For background, I have a scholarship for tuition for the next two years and I'm terrified as fuck that I'll lose that if I get a course load reduction. Also, my parents basically don't know what mental health is so there's no way I can talk to them about it.
