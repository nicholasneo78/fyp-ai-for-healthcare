seeing other people having close, intimate relationships with each other made me so goddamn sad that I had to leave.
I was at a party last night with some friends, and the whole time I saw people talking and hanging out like they were best friends and had known each other for years. It made me really sad because even though I have a wide circle of acquaintances, my mental illness and my fear of rejection makes it so hard to actually get close to people. I’ve been in college for a year and a half and I still don’t have any close friends that I text or hang out with. My friends from high school are all off at different colleges living their own lives now, so we aren’t close anymore. I kept thinking about this last night at the party and I got so sad that I left. 

I can only really think of one close friend that I have, and even then we don’t really hang out that often. I don’t really have anyone in my life.
