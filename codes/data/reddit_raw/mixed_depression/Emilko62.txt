I wrote a poem about depression
Little Johny's gone today,
Little Johny ran away,
Little Johny's at the bay,
Little Johny fades away,
Little Johny what'd you say?

"I don't want to live another day"

Oh tissue tissue how many tears can you soak?
Depression is no joke,
not cured by drink or smoke,
more scarier than a stroke,
leaves a scar on most folk.
That's the power of one dead bloke.

Every second a man falls down.
Every second someone drowns.
Every second a bullet to the head,
leaves someone lying dead.
All you see is one small frown.
In this little shitty ghost town.

It's your fault, where were you?
Don't you know that dead hearts bleed too?
Now it's our time to go.
because depression is not for show.
