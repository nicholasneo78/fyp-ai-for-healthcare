When I was twelve, one of my younger sisters got leukemia. Despite my failing memory I can still remember a lot of what happened back then. I can remember being picked up at the park where I was playing to rush to the hospital where my sister had been getting tested. You could say I was whisked away from my innocence, but you're pretentious and I'm not. I can remember how my mother broke the news to me. And how her voice cracked a little when I asked how bad she had it. I can remember sitting in the front room of my grandparent's place, where I was staying so my parents could be with my sister in hospital, speaking to my cousin and saying that I felt it was somehow my fault. What followed was roughly a year of total disruption. My sister became the focus, understandably, while the rest of us learned to cope with the cloud hanging over us. Where a small rise in temperature could send hearts racing. But that has mostly been forgotten. Not blocked away, just forgotten. It was another age and doesn't feel real anymore. In the past few months the hospital has been doing a study of ex-patients and their families. Tonight it was my turn to do the phone interview. I'd been avoiding it, mostly because I'm lazy and I only ever seem to do things that I feel will be enjoyable to me. Anyway, so they called through and I spoke. I don't think there were really any surprises, although it was bizarre when I became conscious to the fact that I occurred to her getting cancer as it or that. I think I only said cancer once in the entire interview. Does that mean I'm crazy? Struggling to cope? I don't know. Of the questions they asked, I don't think I answered any that would cause a worry.
