I have been on antidepressants for probably 10 years now. I was on Serzone which worked very well. My husband and I decided to get pregnant so I had to stop it. I have now been on Zoloft, Effexor and Celexa. I am currently taking 40mg Celexa (generic) and 75 mg Effexor. What I'm wondering is- are hot flashes normal with antidepressants? I don't remember having them on Serzone but I have had them since I started Zoloft. I'm not sure if this is from the medications or pregnancy and nursing? Anyone have experience with this- either medications or pregnancy and breastfeeding? I am 26 by the way
