When boredom turns depressing.
Maybe you have nothing to do and you are left to be alone with your thoughts. Maybe you are procrastinating on something and your letting the guilt eat away at you. Maybe life couldn’t be any better, but you still feel like all your pain and suffering that led up to this point in time wasn’t worth it, and it still isn’t a bad idea to commit sepuku.
How do you guys cope?
