Does anyone else dread going to bed at night because you're forced to be alone with your thoughts?
I drown myself out during the day with reddit, podcasts, audiobooks, music, TV, etc. I make sure there's never a moment of quiet otherwise I start thinking about how much shit sucks. But when I'm laying in bed trying to sleep I'm forced to be alone with myself and actually think about things. It sucks.
