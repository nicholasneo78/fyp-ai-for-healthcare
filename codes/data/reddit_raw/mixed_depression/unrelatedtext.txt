These ups and downs are too much for me
I finally went to the dr and got a prescription for an AD but I feel like it’s worse than before. My lows are so low. My highs are just feeling normal. I’ve never seriously thought of suicide before but thoughts creep in my mind now. I can’t sleep. Constantly worried about things in my life. 

I have no reason to feel this way. On the outside, things are fine. Good even. I don’t dare tell my friends so they don’t worry about me. But sometimes I don’t know what to do.
