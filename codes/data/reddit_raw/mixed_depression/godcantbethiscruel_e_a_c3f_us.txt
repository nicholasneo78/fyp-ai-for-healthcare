I am 23 years old. After a long time of finally trying to get my life on track, I finally had it all together. I found the person I was meant to be with for the rest of my life and everything was so wonderful. I have never been so happy. I had known this guy for two and a half years and we always liked each other. Obstacles kept coming up that prevented us from being together; one being that I live in Kentucky and he lives in Texas. After I broke up with my ex in December, we finally got together. He was going to move here in June and it was going to be perfect. Then a few days ago he got into a horrible car crash and lost his memory. He still remembers me but he remembers me as a friend. He doesn't remember me the way we were ... in love. Now whenever I talk to him .... he won't tell me that he loves me back and he acts like I make him uncomfortable. When I tell him about the way things used to be, he doesn't seem to care. I don't he can't remember but it is so devastating for me. I'm terrified that he won't remember how much he loved me and that he will find someone else down there. I am finding it extremely hard to cope and almost feel like I can't function. I don't know what to say/do anymore. Any advice / thoughts would be so appreciated!
