Women ignore me, even here, they think I'm unworthy or too ugly to be helped. I even have the stats to prove it. Why am I so undeserving of love?
I made a post yesterday today asking for help as to why I'm undatable and why no women wants to go out with me. I got 450+ views and only 6 comments, only 1 of which was from a woman. Everyone else was a male who either tried to give some advice or made fun of me. Here's proof: https://imgur.com/a/TRWg3

So if 250 women viewed my profile, only one person tried to say something. Everyone else ignored me. 1/250. 249/250 women think I'm ugly or not worthy of a relationship. Think about that. That's how unwanted I am. What if every 3 minutes, someone told you "you're ugly, no one wants you, no one cares for you, and you will die forever alone"? That's the life I might as well live in. Let's not also forget the people that made fun of me too. I mean, what do you want me to do to get your replies, ladies? Do you want me to give you gold? Will that incentivize you to reply?

The sidebar says "A supportive space for anyone struggling with depression." and yet people make fun of me, don't want to help, and call me ugly. I guess I'm that hopeless. 

Am I really a human anymore? It's human to fall in love and get into relationships and have sex and whatnot with your SO. It's human to even hookup with people. I'm not qualified to be a human apparently. I bet most people my age have had 3-4 SOs, and I've had a big fat 0. Even other people with anxiety and depression can get into relationships, when other people see them, their mental illness makes them want to care for them, but for me, they run away. It's apparent in this subreddit too. Not even worthy of being spoken to from a woman.
