My story, i have to get this off my chest. Life sucks
Hello everyone,

This is a post about my life basically, i just need to get this off my chest. Its a long post but i just have to do this.

Let me introduce myself first. Currently im a 19yo boy who turns 20 in March, I live in Belgium (grammar will be bad sorry). 
I have 1 older brother,  2 loving parents who are still together. And oh yeahh i have a very cute pupper as well. Financially everything is fine. 
Basically a family some people only can dream for. I mainly play on nintendo consoles (switch, 3ds, gba, n64) and the MMORPG runescape (dont laugh :))
I consider myself a extravert to my friends but an introvert when im talking to girls (lol) or strangers.

I've always had a rough time fitting at school. Our elementary school was VERY SMALL, it only had 75 kids (including kindergarden). I was always the "odd one out", but because it was so small i had 1 friend. We played alot together and it was a ok time really. but when i was 5 most people around me started to notice that i made weird random noises. And that i made small movements with my shoulders (unnatural ones). Friends got annoyed, parents got annoyed, everyone got annoyed. Eventually my teacher screamed at me telling me to shut up, RIP ME. 
Eventually mom took me to a specialist and it turned out i have Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, if you youtube this you will get extreme cases where people shout fuck and ass, and move uncontrollably all over the place. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH ME. I think Tourette affected my life ALOT (it still does!!). I was always a really shy kid until i was 11, i started to accept my tourettes and was a happy 11yo.

**HIGH SCHOOL** (from 12 to 18yo, its devided in 6 "classes". 
This is where the problems started, when i just started high school i was scared but excited like everyone. Unfortunately for me i got the SHITTIEST bullies in my class. I had no friends in year 1, they made fun of me becuz of my tourettes (i didnt tell them becuz they wouldnt understand). It got to a point where i just smacked someone on the head with a baseball bat. Teachers knew of my situation so we both got 1 week detention. I was "depressed" during that year, you know the teenage life, its hard. Year 2 they changed me to another class and they were OK. They didnt bully me but they didnt talk to me either. They just left me alone really, during those 2 years i had 1 friend who i talked with but he also had his own friends. So most of the time i was alone.
But that friend had no common interests, so i ended up playing runescape all day, u can talk with other players there and i had plenty of friends in there. It felt awesome to have friends and i spent all my time there neglecting my studies. But somehow i passed  the first 2 years lol.

I thought year 1 was bad, but then i met year 3 (different school). I got bullied even more in this class, they called me names, ignored me, humiliated me in class and started bitching if they had to sit next to me. Luckily they never got fysical with me (idk if thats the right word). In the middle of that year I decided 
 in the middle of the fucking winter (it was snowing) in morning to take the bus (mom was always home and it was near our house) and to step of early. Spent 2 hours in a small freezing cold chapel playing on my nintendo 3ds, go to my house after mom left and spend playing games in my room. 
After 3 days the school called, my mom found out. I was stuck and told her everything about the bullying, about me feeling like absolute shit and that i had no motivation to go to school. She let the teachers know, went to school, got me to a psychiatrist. The bullying stopped, but they still ignored me, i still hadnt any friends and i still didnt feel any better. I somehow survived the 4 next months and passed. If i had 1.1% lower in total i would have failed that year. 
The only way i felt better was with playing runescape.

YEAR 4-6 IS IN THE SAME CLASS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE, in year 5 three people joined
Year 4 kinda went the same as year 2 believe it or not. The classmates were ok, they didnt bully me, they talked to me when needed but that was it. I spent my time with some kids i met on the playground. But u know they were those kind of friends u just spent time with becuz nobody else is around. They never invited me to go to parties or to hang around or anything. This year was also the 1st year i told them about my Tourette Syndrome ( i got some damn weird looks at times and i didnt even realize i was making sounds). They understood, they acted more nice to me, i didnt feel left out so much but was still unhappy.
And on runescape i got into a community (clan), made some good friends there. It was the only place in the word i was truly happy. 

Year 5, same class as last year. 3 people joined and 1 of them became a friend of mine. To be completely honest he is still one of my best friends today, but i come back to that later. Lets call him J, Ok so now i had a friend. We had a small group of 3 people now, S (other classmate who was nice to me), J and me. 2 others from another class joined the group somehow and i finally made some friends. We started going to parties and they invited me. Unlucky for me they dont play runescape and have different interests in gaming, thanks to this im not that close to them. But i was finally starting to be happy becuz i had friends. 
All the small things that bothered me (sitting alone, always last chosen at sports etc etc...), bothered me alot less becuz i was super happy i finally found something positive in my life. I survived year 5 and 6 fairly positive compared to year 1 and 3. We all graduated and college time arrived

**COLLEGE**
This was last year, so this is super recent. I decided to study "orthopedagogie", it doesnt have an english translation. Its working with mentally disabled people or troubled young people, stuff like that.
Ofcourse I begged my parents for a student room, i wanted to have a great college life like in the movies! Everyone says its the best time of your life and you should enjoy it to the fullest. Oh boy i was so so dumb for believing it would be that easy. And ofcourse i also joined a society. Finally growing up like an adult and living alone, I WAS FREEEEEEEEEEE.
In my class i got along with most of them, we had some good laughs during breaks, went to our class etc... but i was the only one who had a student room (unlucky). So ye that was that. In my society i tried making friends, but it didnt work out really. I missed some first important parties becuz i decided to go with some classmates (i still think to this day that this was a huge mistake), when i went to parties alone to make friends  (because i realized my class was lame) they already a "friend group". I didnt know (and still dont) how to make contact with them and make friends.

I was really really really lonely last year, i just spent all my time playing runescape, talking with my online friends. November 2016 i met someone and we became super super super super close. (he is american, not lovers just friends). We still talk to each other everyday. Man we even were planning to go to japan together but my mom wont let me. But coming back to that later.
During the weekends i had my old friend group from highschool, we still hang out 2x per month, we still do. But they mostly spent time studying and hanging out with their uni friends. They didnt left me out or anything but i had lost alot of contact with them. I failed 50% of my courses, i decided to call it quits. I was happy that i could finally leave that student room. uni year 1 was HORRIBLE.

I liked the study i was doing, so i decided to try it again but in a lower degree, its in a school for adults (18+). Its hard to explain but basically i ended up with 60% out of 20 people to be 30+ and have kids. It was class 1x a week and internship (idk if thats the right word) 2.5 days per week. I was working with adults who had a mental disability. Last year i never had internship, only class. It turns out that Orthopedagogie is not the study for me. I dont want to do this the rest of my life. I had officially quit november 2017. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We finally arrived to the present time, thank you for the people that made it here. 

So here i am, a 19 year old boy (almost 20), wasted 1.5 years in uni, wasting parents money... I have no idea what i want to study next... The only study i consider doing is social work, luckily for me u can start in february. So i have to do some shitty job from november - february.
I still have my highschool friends who i hang out with 2x per month? I have a loving brother and parents, good financial situation. I can earn some quick cash for 3 months and go back to study. But to be completely honest... I DONT SEE THE FUCKING POINT.

My whole life i have felt lonely, sometimes with a good reason, sometimes really without a reason. I have dealt with "depression" (not officially diagnosed), or atleast felt like i was. 
To be completelty honest. I feel like a sad little fucking sack of shit. What have i achieved in my life? Fucking nothing. I cant even think like a fucking normal person, people think im weird, i dont have logical sense. Everyday i have to force myself out of bed. Its been like this for so long now that im starting to get used to it. Even now that i dont have a job until feb, i simply dont have the strength to get out of bed. I sleep 12 hrs per day just so the day passes by faster.

I dont feel like going out, i dont feel like talking to people. Runescape was always my escape, but i simply do not have the motivation to even play runescape . On the outside i still act normal, i laugh and act like everything is fine so my parents wont worry. Whenever i have a job they fire me because "i work to slow". Once i worked in a storage for a store and had to get the order from customers. You have to use "common sense" all the time, and they said i didnt have that enough for this job. This happened 3x... 

Remember when i said that i have tourette syndrome, well i always told myself that it also does have a "mental" side to it. I can come across different then the "normal person", or use the wrong word in sentences to express myself. And i interpret things differently at times, i usually need to hear the explanation multiple times and they have to explain it very clearly. 
My parents just said im a slow learner but with "hard work i get there". This fucked me over so many times in life, and whenever i tell people/friends about the mental side of tourette they all have that expression on their face. The face of "ohh that explains alot, but i also feel so sorry for you". Im so fucking sick of it, im not even sure if this happens becuz of my tourette. Im really starting to think this is just all in my head and that im just retarded. (my iq is average tho). I often imagine myself having some disorder to make myself feel better, i really dont know what to do with myself.
I feel like an absolute loser who cant even think like a normal person. Last 6 months i bought myself a nintendo switch + some games to cheer myself up. it gets me trough some days but in the end i still end up having no energy to get out of bed.

BUT i feel like an arrogant asshole writing this, i have nothing to complain about... Alot of people had the worst childhood, or had a traumatic experience... I have a family many people can only dream of? financially im good. I have the chance to try studying again.... I HAVE NO REASON TO FEEL THIS WAY AND IT MAKES ME GO INSANE. Im having alot of negative thoughts, and i cant get them out of my head. I dont see the light in the end of the tunnel. (Not stuff like suicide or self cutting btw). 
As i said earlier i met someone a year ago trough rs. I can always talk to him, i never met him in person but we discord at times and message each other everyday. I feel more connected to him than my IRL friends. They have no same interests, other life goals... How sad is that? Fkn someone i met online is my best friend? He is the only 1 that knows how i feel but he doesnt understand how i feel. He tries to support me, but it doesnt help.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Im not making this post so everyone feels bad for me.... Im just so sick of life... I dont know what to do... My parents have their own problems and think im over exaggerating...
"Grow up son? Everyone has to get a job" "Grow up for once". But they dont know what it feel like to drag yourself trough the whole day 24/7 (atleast i hope they dont). They think im just lazy and dont want to work... I feel isolated from the world and i cant get out of it.

Ok god damnit im re-reading this post, at this point im just rambling... Idk what i expect from posting this here... Maybe its just to give my empty brain a boost... 
I will just end this post now or i keep adding stuff.


EDIT: i have no clue how to get the text all the same size
