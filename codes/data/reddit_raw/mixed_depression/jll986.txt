I’ve completed step one
I’m killing myself this year. Not sure when, but I’m really hoping I can make it happen. Last week, I had a wild night in the shower with a lot of vodka and a razor, posted one last snap on my story with a waving emoji, then went full white noise. No snapchat, no instagram, no Facebook, nothing. Broke all my streaks. Now I have no contact with anyone at all. I avoid the people I know at meal times. I stay in my room  and game, or start the long list of letters I have to write to people. The sad thing is, I could have been dead almost a week and no one would know. No one has come to my room to check on me, or message me to ask if I’m ok. No ones seen or heard from me in days. I’ve pushed everyone away. Step 1 is complete.
