 Hi, everyone - new to these forum board thingies so please forgive me if this does not end up being posted in the right place! I have lived with depression since I was 14 years old (I am now 43). For the past 10 years I have been managing this condition without the aid of drugs or stimulants. My life changed the day I stopped fighting the "condition" and accepted it as part of who I was. Acceptance is the greatest gift you can give yourself on the road to recovery, not only does it take away the stigma, it also gives the fear nothing to feed on. For those of you who are still in the depths of darkness, please don't give up hope, there are many of us out here who, have experienced exactly what you are going through now, we survived - so can you. Recovery is possible, it just takes time and a little faith in yourself. Thank you for allowing me to join this community, I hope my experiences of living with this condition can help others, the door to the email box is always open! Kindest regards to all
