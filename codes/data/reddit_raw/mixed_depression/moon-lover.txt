I don't want to get out of depression
I've had it for so long I just can't get out amymore... I feel like I don't deserve to get out because of all the stupid stuff I've made... I'm starting to not take my pills and trying to socialize less..

I will only get out of depression when I know I deserve it.. when my life has no problems and then I'll know that there's no problems on my life...
