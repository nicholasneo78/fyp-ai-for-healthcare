I should be on anti-depressants but don't want to
Negative emotions prevent me from thinking correctly or consistently. It so hard to keep things in the right perspective. I get angery and scared I will have a heart attack during a bout of it. 

Sometimes I act insane just because of how inconsequential or meaningless it is, which isn't the right way to act. I don't know why I don't try to think positively or if I can.

I think I should really quit my job but it would be the wrong decision in the long run maybe
