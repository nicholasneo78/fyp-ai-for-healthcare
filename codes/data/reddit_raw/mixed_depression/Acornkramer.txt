I am so fucking lonely...
My husband is my best friend. Hes my dude. And when hes busy I have friends to fall back on as well. Recently the whole family got back to back sickness and we were basically quarantined for two weeks just bumming around trying to get better. So I let my kid watch too much tv, let my husband play all the video games, so i could do my stuff with out being bothered as well. Let me also say, I didnt plant my kid in front of the tv for hours on end, but I have to shower, and keep up with the house because man colds are much more sever (no...). Now that were better his behaviors have continued, even though i have spoke to him many times; things wont be like this when were not longer sick. My kid isn't a tv kid and I plan to keep it that way as long as I can.. but he.. he doesn't want to spend time with me any more, just step away from electronics and just chill and talk and play with our kid together... so I wanted to talk to my friends or even my mom... and I realized I don't have very many friends. 

EDIT: I don't care about this getting up votes or anything but sharing it makes me feel a little less lonely.. also sorry for any spelling grammatical errors im usually obsessive but i feel like shit 


tl;dr: Husband plays games:: stops communicating with me :: Realized hes my only true friend.
