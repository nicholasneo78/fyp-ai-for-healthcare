My depression is getting worse
And the bad thing is that I already did all the things that someone would say to a depressed person. I've talked to a lot of psychologists (for about 5 years or maybe more), psychiatrist, I've been on antidepressants meds, I Meditate every day,I have been on several nofap periods (I broke a lot of streaks btw), I do physical exercise (I used to be a gym rat) and when I'm out I try to be social (I'm out basically only when I go to work or to the gym). But still my life is shit, I don't have friends, neither a gf, social interactions with women are nearly 0 and I think that all of them are bitches. I'm also poor and I don't see any way things can get better, I feel like I tried all the things that should help and nothing has helped . Sometimes I laugh when I realize the absurdity of my life and my situation. I don't really know for how much it can go on like this, I see that the moment when I'll buy a gun and shot myself in the head is coming...
