Could anyone help me.!  First my doctor gave me Wellbutrin SR ... well it made me too panicky .. This was 150 SR.  So then he gave me Wellbutrin XL at 150 mg.  This was doing well but not quite enough so he gave me 300 XL and I was so sleepy I could not handle it.  I don't know why it made me so sleepy but I only stayed on it a few days and then I went back to the doctor and he said "ok let's go back to the SR pills but at 100 mg.  Well I'm still have those nervous feelings.  It's like I get hot, I get antsy and dizzy headed.  I'm guessing the SR is dispensed faster or something?  Could anyone please help me and tell me what has worked the best for them.  I would appreciate any help I could get.
