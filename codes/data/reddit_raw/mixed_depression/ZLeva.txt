Dead Mom, Schizophrenic Father.
I wrote a 1,900 page message but I figured no one would read it. My mother committed suicide because I left home after years of neglect and emotional abuse. I couldn’t go to my father because he has severe schizophrenia and it’s not safe to be around him. I moved across country after my sister who had left a year prior convinced me to do. After I moved across country my sister gave me 2 weeks to get an apartment or she’d kick me out. I got a job and an apartment (with the help of a really shitty roommate) and I had been working practically trying to just ignoring my previous life. A week ago I found out my mother had killed herself and now me and my sister are back to our old home trying to fix all the problems created by her unexpected (I honestly expected it) death. I’ve left all details out because I could fill a fucking book with them but the main point of this post is, I’ve been fighting all my life for a better life but things always seem to get worse and worse. I’m at the point where I feel like joining my mother. You can only fight for so long before you’ve run out of energy.
