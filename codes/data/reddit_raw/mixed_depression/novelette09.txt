I don't have the motivation for anything anymore.
I just don't.
Not even for the things that i love.

I've always struggled with depression, i've had it for like 6 years now.
But lately for some reason it has gotten really bad, to the point that i can't even live my life anymore.
I can't concentrate on school, i don't feel like talking to people, i don't feel like replying to messages. I don't even feel like crying anymore, i just feel like a mess.
All i do everyday now is listen to music, listen to music and daydream.
Daydream of all the things that i really want to do, but i just can't find the motivation to actually do.

I feel lost. I really don't even know where i stand anymore.
