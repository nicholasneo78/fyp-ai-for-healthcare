this is my first post , so bare with me. I have been married a year and just found out some interesting news about my husband. He told me that the man he calls dad is not really his father. He told me that his mother never told him until he was 13 years old, and had to go to court to change his name. I always wondered why, he and his father never got along. His mother won't tell him who his real father is. I feel I need to help him find him, so he can close the door, and get answers to all his questions. My husband does not like to talk about feelings, he was raised in a family where no one talked about feelings and if you had a problem you  kept it to yourself. I was raised totally opposite. In ways this has left him hurt and confused. He feels like he doesn't belong sometimes. He told me sometimes he would like to know who his dad is and other times he could care less. But, it seems like it is always on his mind, when family issues come about. The man that raised him, is an issue all to his own, he is very abusive, physically, and mentally. He is always telling my husband, he is wrong and will never be able to be successful.

He has heard that all his life, but he has never believed it - he is strong and has a good heart - It just hurts me when I see him lash out. He takes all his problems out on me, I now understand why.

 I have not told him, but I found out who his father is. All I have is a name. I want to tell him but don't know if I should. I don't want his mother not to talk to him if he knows - I'm very confused - I'm right in the middle and don't want anyone to get hurt. Looking for advice - or someone that can relate to this.
