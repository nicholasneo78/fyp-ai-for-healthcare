I think I'm in an abusive friendship and I don't know what to do.
One of my close friends with borderline has been constantly reinforcing and triggering my social anxiety. Everything is apparently all my fault, always, Apparently everyone (whatever that means) says I'm nuts, Im controlling, blah blah. She tried to rediagonse my depression as a narcissistic personality disorder. There's a laundry list of things that have been said to me. It's making me feel useless and sad and reinforcing the notion that no matter how hard I try I will never be good enough, that maybe I deserve to be alone, etc.

I feel like I'm going to have to either let her continue to talk to me like this or stand up for myself and lose her as a friend. While the latter option gives me the peace of mind to think it's not me, that I had enough self worth to stand up for myself and not cave to my friends abusive reinforcement, I really don't want to lose her as a friend. I just don't know what to do, she usually doesn't listen to me anyways. I don't know, maybe I am just a dirtbag.

Does anyone have any thoughts as to how to get out of this cycle?
