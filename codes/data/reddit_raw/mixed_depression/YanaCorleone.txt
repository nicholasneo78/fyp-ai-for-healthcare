I think i might be depressed , even when i'm having an ok life , is it possible?
I'll try to keep this as short as possible , no one likes a wall of text . 

Just as the tittle said , is it possible or i'm just seeing it all wrong?

Summary : I'm a 19 years old dude , NEET at the moment , life was never hard or cruel to me . Don't have many friends but all the friends i have are delightful to me , also my family puts no pressure on me and they are pretty positive overall . The only trauma i experienced so far was the breakup with my ex , but i moved on totally forgot about her . Just an ordinary life in general


But yet , i can't help but notice the subtle changes of my outlook , and in how i feel about life . I was 100% happy-go-lucky my entire life until the end phase of 2015 , but then something happened . Not sure when or why , because looking back nothing real bad happened to me , yet i started to feel more and more indifferent as each day passes . At one point i even stopped contacting people around me because i was like "talk is ok but no talk is ok too" , and even today i still feel that way . 

I still feel joy and moods in life , like eating good food , cry from very sob movies , but at the end of the day there's always something , it isn't feeling the same like how i had felt my entire life . I think it might be because i have no dreams or passions like other folks in my life , but i was always like that and i was always fully content with it .

On a positive note , good thing is i don't have any suicidal thoughts .
