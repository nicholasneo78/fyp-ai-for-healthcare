Older female fighting depression
Hi I’m a 54 year old female that’s recently lost 100 pounds and quit smoking. You think that would solve the depression! But if I don’t keep my mind and body busy at all times, it pops right back up to the forefront. Even when I wake up in the middle of the night just to roll over...Boom, there it is. Sadness and dread. Thanks for listening
