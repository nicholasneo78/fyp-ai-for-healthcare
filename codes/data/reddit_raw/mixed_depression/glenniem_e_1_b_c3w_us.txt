Now, I know we're all on the same bus, but I am an engineer who works with nerds all day.

These people are social misfits (not like I'm not!!!) but I can sit in my hamster cage all day and one will talk to me. They really don't talk to each other unless it's either work - related or they are talking about themselves. It's like working with robots, and they are good at it!

I am really thinking I hate geeks but I am one as well but who knows where that takes me.

Can anyone tell me how this is a healthy atmosphere for any of us? Is it common? If I leave and get another geek job, will it likely be the same?
