She just said sorry and now she's acting like it's all good. No it's not. i don't feel better anyway. And therefore it's not all good. I feel depressed. That's the result of all the psychological violence. I don't see a reason. Not as in “I don't want to live anymore". I'm not that bad. I overslept today. What else can you expect when I haven't slept properly for days. -I- don't want to sleep, I don't need to sleep. Actually I'd rather not sleep. But my body doesn't feel the same. It needs rest. I know it when I feel sick in the middle of class, because I am forcing myself to smile and laugh and not think about what I am thinking of, and trying to stay awake. After school I went to dad's. Again. I ate 'till I got sick, but I didn't throw up. Why can't I just throw up? I think that'd make me feel better. And then I took three cigarettes right in front of him while we were talking about a stupid frame. How can he be that "gone". He didn't look at my hands at all. So I smoked three (very strong) cigarettes and felt dizzy and relaxed as hell. But now I'm feeling noxious. I think I like making myself feel awful. But then I hate feeling it when I'm having an OK day. You know? Like I want to feel bad, but when I'm good, it's sucks to still be bad.
