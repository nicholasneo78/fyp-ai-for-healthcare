Today’s my birthday, and no one remembered.
I wish I could skip today so I wouldn’t have to feel so terrible.

No one ever notices me. I could never hold a candle to anyone else.

I’m just going to go to sleep.

Edit: I didn’t expect so many people to care about me and it honestly made me feel a lot better about myself today. Thank you so much for all the wishes.
