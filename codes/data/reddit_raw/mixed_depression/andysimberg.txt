This is the nicest group of people on the internet.
I would come here everyday even if there wasn't so much helpful advice on here. Especially when I'm having a particularly bad time, when I don't even feel like playing my PS4. Instead of just staring at my game library I open up this subreddit. Makes me feel like I'm not alone. And with everything shitty going on in this world, and all the shitty people around me/us, it's really comforting to see a community online that is being so nice and helpful to each other.
