i
Thanks to anyone who read this.

I can't feel any emotion: happiness, sadness, anger, nothing at all. Just empty inside. Usually i have something in my head, that keeps thoughts inside, but now its nothing here except my inner voice. If i imagine this, it looks like a big endless gray room with voiceless me and my clone somewhere in that room.

Sometimes i think i can cry, but i can't even squeeze out a tear.

I can show emotions, but feel nothing inside.

I can smile if someone makes joke, but it's made up smile.

I don't think friends know more than i told them, but i know there is something they hide from me.

I go to school, but it "feels" like everything just passes around me, like i don't exist.

I don't want anything, just go to sleep and never wake up, but it won't happen to me...

I can't control anything.

When i eat, food doesnt have any difference, it just fills void called hunger.

I can't remember anything happened to me last 4 days. Is it bad memory or nothing really happened to me?

Days ago i had thoughts, good thoughts, bad thoughts, suicidal thoughts, but they are gone now. Same with feelings. All i have now is emptiness.

It hurts so much.
