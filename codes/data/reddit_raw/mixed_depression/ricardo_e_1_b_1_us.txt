We have been playing Quake 4 almost every night for a little while. We play online against other players using Xbox Live and it is very cool. Most people are friendly. We have made some 'friends' and we find them and play with them. One time I found some person talking too much trash and you can go in a mute them or set a preference to never see them again. Well, last night I encountered a group who had a feud going. One kid was talking too much trash and people on the other side were just going with it. I figured one game was a not a big deal. But sometimes you end up finding them again and again in the same night. I have this guy some slack and didn't say anything but then later I got to play as part of the same team with him. What a jerk. He kept asking me to give him the flag so he score it and get the points instead of me. Forget about the team winning, this guy wanted all the points for himself and didn't care about the team. I had to set him straight, and after the game I had to report him as being a trash player and set in my preferences to never see him again. After that I saw the other players and they were all nice. It only takes one guy to ruin a great experience. Overall, playing online with all these people and talking with them is great, you just have to know when to cut someone loose. Eventually when many people report him as being a jerk, he will be banned from the game. Oh well.
