I️ owe 31k in student loans, my mom owes 52k in PLUS loans on my education. I️ feel so terrible..
I’m the first of my 3 siblings to go to college. I got depressed and wasted a year. Now I’m on my 5th year and I won’t graduate till one more semester in the fall. I’ve been working too but I only make enough to cover some of my living expenses. My school schedule only lets me work around 30 hours a week. My mom has helped me out by taking out Parent PLUS loans for me which she is responsible to repay after I graduate. So far she owes $52k while I owe $31k. I feel so shitty, I can’t believe Ive put her through all of this. My dad doesn’t work so it’s just her, and my siblings have yet to finish college (one of them is starting in a couple years). I’m so pissed off at myself, how did I let this happen? If I had my act together I could’ve graduated earlier. I hate myself so much for this, I always prided myself on keeping my mom from harm but she’s going to be in so much debt. It’s so unfair, if I had thought this through maybe she wouldn’t be in this position. Im so close to graduation but so fucking scared. What if I don’t get a job right away? I always said I’d repay my loans then repay my mom but $52k is so much money. More than I’ve ever seen in my life. I’m just taking advantage of her at this point. I’m such a fucking trainwreak. 

Thanks for letting me vent reddit
