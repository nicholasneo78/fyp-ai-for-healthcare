I might be feeling this way, because I demand too much from myself.
I made a similar post about how it could be a sleep problem, but I have a lot of thoughts in my head, so let me share this, and comment if you think you relate.

Basically, I don't want to settle for what my life is right now. I don't want to accept a cheap, easy job. I don't want to accept my poor mental health, and I don't want to take any of the medicine I'm given. I don't want to live with my parents. I think my mom's not smart, and my step-dad has always been an angry alcoholic. I remember the feeling that he hated me ever since my childhood, but then I think he has trouble understanding people. I don't want to be any of the things I hate, and I became very hateful ever since that feeling and the mind fog started.

I don't know. I felt like I'd type more, but it all revolves around money and things I hate about myself and other people.

I just hate the life I have. I feel like I'm in a terrible mindset. It's a mindset that doesn't let me grow, but makes me think I should try as hard as I can to.

I also feel insufferably tired lately, hence the sleep issues post on /r/getting_over_it.
