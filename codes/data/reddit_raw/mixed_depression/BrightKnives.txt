I wanted to kill myself tonight.
I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I've had a very rough few weeks with finding myself jobless, financially struggling and fighting with my boyfriend that I decided to write this little note in my phone. (The ending is supposed to sound funny, it was the only thing that made me laugh and give me that final push thought of pulling myself out of this horrible hole I was in tonight)


Tonight, under a drunken wine induced depression, followed by the realization that someone I trust had betrayed it and lack of anti depressants, i seriously considered slitting my wrists in the bathroom. While sobbing with my hands in my face, trying to figure out who would take care of my son and my unpaid debt, I looked up to see my cat staring at me. She has this stern, mothering expression in her eyes, and we locked eyes for the longest time. She kept my gaze until my sobbing was under control and I really thought about my actions. Maybe she just wanted wet food.


I am really bad at remembering to take my meds, and usually the day or two where I forget doesn't have this effect on me, but for the pile of emotional shit dealt to me the last week or so, apparently it did. I haven't felt suicidal in years and I just need someone to understand where I'm coming from.
