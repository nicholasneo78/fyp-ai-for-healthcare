I lost my best friend.
My best friend used to always be there for me, he was the barnyard kind of personality, with tonnes of love and compassion for everyone around him, and along him was excitement and exploration. We used to explore the woods together and sometimes sit and stare at the campfire for hours until we fell asleep together. 
His name was Archer, he was my cat, and he was my best friend. A woodland animal killed him, he was defenseless..

I've tried with different cats to fill the empty void, but they were never aware of me. Archer was always where I was, and were going. I cry every time I lay down in bed, look to my side and expect a short purr and a hop to my lap.. now there's nothing.
