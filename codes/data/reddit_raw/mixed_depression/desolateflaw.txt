It's extremely difficult for me to cry.
I used to deal with depression through breaking down and crying at night, and it was a really helpful way to out all the negative emotion, and I always felt much better after. For over a year now, it's been extremely difficult for me to cry. Unless I'm pushed to the absolute edge, when I feel like I should be crying it's more just a feeling of emptiness. This means that I feel like I can never release my feelings, and that it feels really greyscale at times, and on the rare occasions I can cry it hardly helps as it's basically a panic attack at that point. I don't really know why I'm posting this, but does anyone else deal with this? I'd love to hear from someone who maybe has advice on how to handle it. Love all of you :)
