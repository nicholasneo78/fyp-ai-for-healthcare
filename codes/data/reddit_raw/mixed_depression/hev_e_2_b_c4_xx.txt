I have been dealing with no self confidence and low self esteem for some many years now I can't count them all. Things have really hit rock bottom. After 6 years my partner has left me. At 26 I feel I'm going to die alone. All I want is to settle down, get married and have lots of babies but I pushed him away. Why did I do that?
I see no light at the end of this tunnel. I feel completely alone. I've cried so long and so hard but it doesn't change the empty feeling I have inside me.
