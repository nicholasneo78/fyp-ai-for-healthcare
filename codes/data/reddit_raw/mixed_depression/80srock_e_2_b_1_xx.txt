Hi I am new to the group. I don't know if I am supposed to even post here. I am not too good with the computer yet!! I feel stupid! I have severe anxiety, and am feeling depressed. I have been struggling with this for years. I am 40 years old and that even depresses me!! I am on xanax for my anxiety, but they don't even help me any more. My doctor has me on 1 mg three times a day. I get the tremors when they ware off!! It is a horrible feeling! I have been on them for Five years and I feel so upset, because I depend on them so much! I wish I could get off them and don't know how. I never thought I would ever be addicted to anything .but I am. I feel like xanax runs my life. I even tremor in the middle of the night. I tried so many Anti-depressants and they make me feel so physically sick. I just really need some advice, and some support! I am crying all the time, and keep having flash backs of bad memories in my life. I have a understanding Mom and Dad, they tries to help me out. At least I am blessed with them. I just want to find happiness again. I have a daughter who is 11 years old and I feel guilty. because, I don't want her to keep seeing me like this!! I try to keep it together around her. She was diagnosed with OCD at 6 years old. It comes and goes with her. I feel like I am the blame for that even! I joined this group a week ago or so and this is my first time posting. I was told to post at the new members' site. I don't know if I am doing this in the right place. I am confused, with all this! I just need to learn more about using the computer!! I would appreciate any help or advice!
