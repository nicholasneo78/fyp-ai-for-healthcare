A little less sad tonight
I really don't know what to say anymore. I can't say anything about stuff I love to people without feeling like I am a burden to them.



Tonight I landed my first kickflip from the street on to the curb. I've been skating for about 10 years now and never been able to do that until now. It may not seem like a lot but it's a challenge that I've faced with fear most of my life. I'm so happy right now I have no one to share it with so I thought this would be the best place to share it with. I normally don't feel happy anymore or generally feel content but right now I do and I want everyone to share something that they're proud of or something that made them hopeful or brought them comfort in a time of misery.
