I attempted suicide and called my GF, who called the cops who then took me to the hospital. I kinda wish I had just died.
We had just broken up and I got the urges to just end my life finally, I've felt like this for years upon years. I've lost so many people in my life recently due to deaths over the last few years, and this just brought me over the edge. I wish I could have ended my life so I don't have to wake up with so much pain everyday.
