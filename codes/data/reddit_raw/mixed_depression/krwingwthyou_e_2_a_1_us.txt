As my guidance counselor has pointed out to me, depression is anger and hatred turned inward... now, aside from the cliché, I'll try to answer your question... I suppose I have been hating myself since first grade (the earliest I remember) when I wrote that I hated myself in my school folder...Currently I am 18, and I have been in therapy with a psychologist for a year and 3 months now and currently am not taking any medications. I am not sure if my depression causes my self esteem issues, but I feel it is more likely in my case that my self esteem issues help fuel my depression. As far as your question about treatment, I cannot speak for medication seeing as how I have never experienced it, but I have had a very very positive therapy experience...being able to connect with someone, and learn to trust, has made me feel valuable and important in life. I highly recommend, if you are comfortable of course, trying cognitive therapy...it may feel impossible and overwhelming at first, and it can be difficult to find a good match in a therapist, but once you do and are able to really work with them, it's all worth it
