To some I have the dream the life ... dream home, financially stable, great family, community volunteer. I am 35 years old. I have a wife that loves. I have 3 children that love me. I have foster children that love me. I teach children daily that love me. I have parents that love me, I even beat cancer this past year ... so if everything is so great then WHY?

Why do I feel this way? Why have I felt this way for so long? Why is this happening to me? Why was 2 hours ago "okay" and now ...  right now, I am hanging on by a thread ... actually I am not even hanging on ... the thread is just holding me.

I don't want to continue. I don't want to talk to anyone. I don't want to be around my family. I don't want to go to work. I don't want to breathe. I just want to stop. I want it all to stop. I want to quit ...  I want to to not care about what others will think or about who I am leaving behind. I want to go.

Tomorrow will bring another day ... but I don't know that I can make it through tonight.
