I'm only 16, and I don't have the energy nor the motivation to do anything, and I'm constantly sad.
Everything seems bland and pointless, I feel sad constantly, and the things I used to enjoy such as video games, and it's slowly growing old. I've been thinking a lot about the fact that I'm alone and never had any sort of relationship with girls for the past 16 years of my life, and it's really bringing me down. 17 soon, hopefully things will get better with time.
