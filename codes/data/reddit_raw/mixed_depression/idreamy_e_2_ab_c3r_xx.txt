I just need to rant because I see what my life could be and what it really is and just get so frustrated! I want to be / feel normal! Instead I keep a part time job I hate when I should quit so I can focus on my wedding and school and other things. I'm failing horribly in school and there is no reason why I should! I have a learning disability but I should try harder, and I only do part time studies! Our wedding is coming up and of course planning is stressful but I want to be more organized.

My fiance each have close family members who recently got very ill & are so worried and trying to cope and take care of them. Sure we have a lot on our plate but I see people with the same amount of stuff at the same time!

For example I knew a person in high school who was always on the honor roll, took an extra night class, had a boyfriend, friends and social life, and a job! Then in University the same thing as well as scholarships.

I would crumble under the pressure! I'm so sick and tired of doing a half assed job of managing my life.

I HAVE TO quit that job, stop watching tv when I should study, organize my things rrARRRRGGGGG I'm just so angry. I'm 25 years old and a total mess. I don't know what I did to deserve the angel who will soon be my husband, but I'm so thankful that he keeps me afloat & my head on my shoulders.
