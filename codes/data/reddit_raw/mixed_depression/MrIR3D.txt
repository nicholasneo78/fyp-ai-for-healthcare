Feeling alone, just wanna run away from everything.
Hello to the community,
I feel like I’m lost and alone that no one can help me.
It started when I was around 15 and now I’m 20.
I can’t sleep at the night, my head is so full of think everything and nothing at the same time. I just wanna run away from everything from everybody.
I don’t have Plans for my future job, I’m studying at a college and don’t even know what to do after that.
I just want everything to end..
I also have moments of stress where I just feel like I’m passing out and the doctor don’t find anything. 
What am I supposed to do ?
