episodes
once or twice a month i have these what you may call severe depression episodes where the thoughts of suicide fill every part of my brain. my heart starts beating extremely fast and i cant keep my eyes off of my meds just lying around on the table.  my mind is full of questions such as, should i do it? what would happen if i took all my meds right now? is it that easy? will everything be over then? am i going to just stop existing? then i start bawling my eyes out and cry myself to sleep. i know im probably not going kill myself, at least any time soon. im too scared of it. its just that i feel like im in a neverending cycle and im really tired of it.
