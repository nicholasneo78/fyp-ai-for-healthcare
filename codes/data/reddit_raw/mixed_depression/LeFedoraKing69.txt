I don't know what I am living for...
I honestly don't know why I keep living another day, I have no one to love me, my very friends are dick heads, my parents don't care how i am feeling and when they do they just throw a bible verse at my face acting as if talking to some sky man is going to cure me, I have yet to even hug a girl in my life, probably because I'm such an ugly awkward beta shit... I have no plans for my future, I am overall retarded In school. All I can do is be an escapist by playing video games, watching videos, eating unhealthy food, and all i do is isolate myself from reality... My therapist is overall useless, all she does is repeat the same shit I hear from people... 

I honestly don't comprehend why I won't just end it all...
