I don't know what's wrong with me. I have always had depression, and in the past thought of suicide. I got over the suicide idea mostly, but now I'm worried i might have something severe. My dad brought up Multiple sclerosis, and it's worried me ever since. i have a few symptoms of ms, such as fatigue, cognitive problems, and muscle twitches. all the other symptoms i don't really have, and fatigue and cognitive problems can be from depression i believe. well, anyways, i keep getting worried about it, and i started getting scared (anxiety?) and i cant sleep. then right when i just start sleeping, my legs or arms twitch, waking me up abruptly. i would go see a doctor, but i have no medical coverage, and no job.

could this ms idea just be mental, turning into a physical problem with my limbs moving right when i start falling asleep? i do know, when i start falling asleep, i start dreaming then i suddenly move the limb i move in the dream. but also, i don't need to be almost asleep and my arm or leg will move slightly.
