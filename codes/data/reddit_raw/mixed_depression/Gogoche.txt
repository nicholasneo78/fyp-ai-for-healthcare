Just wondering, for those who have had lifelong depression did you ever find some joy that wasn’t turned to a sad story?
I’m starting to feel that depression never goes away, you just learn to manage it. I however, can’t recall a time in my life where I was happy. I don’t even congratulate myself when I do accomplish something. I don’t allow others to either, because it doesn’t mean much to get praised for things I should’ve accomplished a long time ago. Anyways, I’m on meds and truth is, I don’t feel like myself? I don’t think any drug can make me feel myself? Depression in some wicked way has made me become the person I am today. A lot of my coping skills and defense mechanisms are still present and that makes a lot of who I am.
