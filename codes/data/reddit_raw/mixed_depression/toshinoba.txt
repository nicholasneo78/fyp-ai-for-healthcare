So yesterday was my 18th birthday, and here my dumbass was expecting it to be different than all my other ones, but boy was I wrong. It's nice to know that no one gives a fuck about you. You can cry, and scream all you want but at the end of the day, no one is gonna be able to understand you, and the deep well that has been buried within your mind. So what if you grew up rejected by every girl, guy, and person? So what if you've just turned 18 and endured waves upon waves of mental abuse? At the end of the day, when you're laying in your bed, and your demons are starting to swallow you whole and fill up the bowl, what do you do? You face it. You indulge yourself in them until the pain is numb, and you can't feel anything anymore. It may not be healthy, but it's better than suffering. Happy fucking birthday bro, have your cake.
