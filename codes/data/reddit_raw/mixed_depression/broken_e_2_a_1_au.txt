I know life isn't easy but I never knew it would be this hard... :( I feel empty and numb, but at the same time so sad and hurt... My biggest struggle is with my family, the only person that is there for me is my Step Dad... No one else seems to get it? My mum is always telling me to not keep secrets and that I should tell her how I feel coz if she doesn't know everything how can she help me? But I don't want to have to tell her everything (Because she says hurtful things back at me once I tell her and she won't even hug me) but if I don't tell her she makes me feel so bad and so I do tell her how I feel and then she shoots me down! She tells me to snap out of it and just get on with it and to stop being so stupid... every time I talk to my mum I cry coz she hurts me so much! And then she gets all down coz she makes me down which makes me down!!! I JUST CAN'T WIN! These days I only have to say something like "oh that sucks, no milk" and she tells me to get over it or get lost! And all I did was say something. I can't even really explain it? It's like she won't be happy until she hears what she wants to hear... I have tried talking to her about the way she makes me feel and all I get is "that's just life" or she starts telling me how she buys me things and that I should feel like this coz she has brought me things and let me use her car, etc, etc... The other day I was haven a really bad day and I asked mum for a hug and all she could say is "No..." she says she doesn't want to feed my sadness BUT instead of doing happy things she just tells me to get over it! And she won't listen when I say stop...She even told me to pack my bags and leave once if I didn't get over whatever it was I was going through! If I didn't have my step dad I wouldn't be here today... I love him more than the world and he is the only one that shows me that he loves me... I just need help... I don't want to be like this but then there are days when I love to feel sad and hurt.
