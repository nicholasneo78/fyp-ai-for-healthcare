For some reason ...
I am never happy anymore ...
It all started a little less than a year ago.
Suicide attempts, cutting, burning, hair pulling, slapping, basically just wanting to die.
People tell me my life isn't that bad just because my family has money.
Money isn't everything.
Also, everyone spreads rumors about me, and tells me crap to my face!!!
My boyfriend is really sweet and I LOVE him, but he has a serious anger issue!
His psychologist diagnosed him with an anger issue.
And lately when he gets frustrated, he sometimes hits me.
Not like REALLY hard, but hard enough to leave a mark.
Then later he doesn't remember doing it.
I'm worried about him, and myself.
I don't want our relationship to end because of our problems.
And none of my friends understand why I cut and stuff.
It's not always for attention you know!!!
So, if someone could please email me at xxx.
Or reply.
That would be great.
Please talk to me
