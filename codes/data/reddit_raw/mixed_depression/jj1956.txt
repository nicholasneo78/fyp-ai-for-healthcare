Dear reddit, happiness isn't a choice for everyone
I'm sorry but I need to get this off my chest in a place where people will understand me.

Dear people that think happiness is a choice, it's not. Me or my fellow sufferers don't choose to be miserable. In fact if it really was that simple, I'm sure 99% of us would choose to be happy without even having to think.

I feel sad because I have mental illness. If you don't know, that means my brain isn't normal. My brain has deficiencies and such that keep me from feeling happy, even when I should.

I'm so sick of reading replies to mine and other people's post about depression that try to oversimplify a serious mental illness that can cause suicide.

I swear everyone on this website assumes we do nothing to try to help ourselves. I really can't believe people are that misinformed that they really think that many people choose to be that miserable. You wouldn't choose to be miserable if you had the choice, and so would we. But we don't get that choice.

Then we have comments like "Just put a life together that wont make you depressed". I think these piss me off the most. If it was really that simple you think I would of done that by now? Also a lot of people don't mention how hard changing your life can be if you don't have money or resources.

TLDR: Stop oversimplifying a serious illness
