It's been happening for awhile .... i have been sexually harassed and sexually assaulted .... the kid next door who is the same age as me has been touching me in unwanted places ...... i tell him to stop and it gets worse .... it's not that i want to stop him it's that i can't stop him .... it has gotten worse he keeps touching me and now he would like me to have sex with him but i wont do it ...... he's going too far as it is .... if i keep telling him to stop .... then i don't what will happen next if i tell a cop then he just as well kill me cause i don't know what his reaction will be and i don't think i want to go there to find out.....i have no one i want to tell so i really can't spill unless I'm on here cause no one knows who i really am and what kind of person i am ..... I'm scared ...... i have been violated ... what's next .... well i guess I'll find out tomorrow
