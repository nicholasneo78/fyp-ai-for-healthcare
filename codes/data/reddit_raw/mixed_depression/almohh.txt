Hey, I’m a student at university and I think I’m going have depression. I cry all the time for no reason, I feel like my life has no purpose. I have severe self esteem issues and I’m really unmotivated with life. Sometimes I think it’ll just be better to just kill my self, I hate feeling like this:(
