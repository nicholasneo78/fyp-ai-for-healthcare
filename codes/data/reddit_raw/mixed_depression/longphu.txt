I know I am depressed but I have no energy to do anything to counter it.
I've been searching for a job for 4 months to no avail (I used to have an office job for 4 years before quitting it to take a leap of faith to migrate to another country), and from the second month onward, I've plunged deeper and deeper into depression. 

Back then in uni days, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and was put on medications. I've been off them since my graduation, because I didn't want to depend on them for the rest of my life and I didn't really have the funds to continue the treatment back then. 

These days I feel exactly like I am slogging through those low energy periods again. My mind would never shut down at my usual bedtime and at times anxiety would keep me awake until 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning. My biological clock is a total mess, in the morning I would just sleep in and refuse to wake up, even though it's already past noon. I tend to shy away from as much social interaction as possible; I just plainly don't want to meet anyone, it freaks me out and makes me uncomfortable. I even refuse to answer any emails or continue the dreary job searching and job application.

I know that I am in a big mess. I disgust myself for my lack of energy and determination to do anything. But then when I'm faced with the colossal task at hand, I'd chicken out, then I'd sleep on it, hoping that everything would somehow sort themselves out, only to find myself wake up in the next morning groggy and lethargic. Nothing has changed, and I'm still deep in depression.
