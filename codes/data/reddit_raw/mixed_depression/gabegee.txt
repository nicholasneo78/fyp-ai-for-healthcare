This girl I don't really know walked up to me and drew a heart on my paper
I know it's something so small and meaningless but it made me really feel better. My day was really hard and some portions I felt as if I was going to start crying. I despise myself and the fact that someone can walk up to me and draw something kind of sweet and cute on my paper makes me feel less gross and insecure.

Sadly my awkward self didn't respond very fast and by the time my brain was able to form a "aww thank you" she walked away.

Thanks Trinity, that was really nice, it really did make me feel better.
