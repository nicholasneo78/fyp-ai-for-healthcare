I Just Found Out I'm a Toxic Person
I manipulate people
I ruin all my relationships
I don't want to get help or change
I have problems
I shove said problems onto other people
I cause other people to be angry
I am extremely critical of everything and everyone
I blame others for my problems
I hate myself

Thanks for reading
