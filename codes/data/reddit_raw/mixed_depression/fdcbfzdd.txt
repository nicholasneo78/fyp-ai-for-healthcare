I feel like I'm lazy
I feel like I'm lazy because I have no will, desire, or energy to work. Sometimes I don't even want to walk.. and I'm tired pretty much always. It's a work out to even brush my hair. I'm physically fit, young, and given special treatment because I'm society's fit of attractive. I can't keep a job because I simply can't force my brain to do the work or I have to miss because I'm sick.. which really is just anxiety I'm sure. No one understands that I care about how lazy I seem and that it's just that I'm so tired and every thing sounds awful other than just sitting some days. I feel like I'm crazy. It just makes everything worse too. More financial problems. More people who don't understand. Substance abuse to numb. How do you guys get energy? I've started Zoloft and it's changed my life, really improving my ability to deal and not feel hopeless, but my motivation is still completely zero and I can't make myself do or care about anything. Is it just immaturity or is something in my head doing this?
