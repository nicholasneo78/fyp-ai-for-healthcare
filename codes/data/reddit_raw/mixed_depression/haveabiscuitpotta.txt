I feel so lost
Hi. I'm 15 year old girl from India and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. Everybody is passionate about something right? I'm not. I don't ever remember the last time in my life I was genuinely excited about anything. What makes everything worse is that in 1 month, I have to decide what I'm going to do with my life. Here in India, we don't get to pick our classes individually. In junior and senior year, you pick what stream you want (Commerce, Humanities, Medical or Engineering). The first two bore the hell out of me. I'd like to do Medical but I don't think I can study for another ~10 years after high school. I'm good at the Engineering subjects (Physics, Chemistry and Math) and I like CS but I've never really enjoyed doing it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bad at studying. I'm among the top kids at my school. Everybody thinks I have my life figured out and somehow that just makes it worse. I'm fucking terrified of what the future holds. I stay up whole nights crying just going over what is going to happen and trying to achieve some sort of clarity about what I'm going to do. I have tons of friends at school but I've never connected with anyone. There was this one guy I was really good friends with and had a crush on since 6th grade but he changed schools last year and we lost touch. I've tried making actual new friends since then but it's never clicked with anyone. There are good days and bad days, the latter consisting of me drawing all the curtains in my room, turning off the lights, wrapping myself in my blanket and just laying there in the dark. It embarrasses me to admit that that is what I'm doing right now. I really want to go to college in the US just to experience something new for once but med school is really expensive. I just want to feel happy about something for once. Why does nothing interest me anymore? I feel like a robot going through the same routine everyday. Eat, study, sleep, repeat. 

I just want to be happy.
