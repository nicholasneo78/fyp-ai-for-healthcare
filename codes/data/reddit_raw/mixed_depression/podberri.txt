Does anyone care?
I have 1 friend but I haven’t physically seen them in 7 years but we FaceTime and talk every single day until recently. No big deal I’m pretty used and expect people to drift out of my life. I know people who I used to be friends with but now we are just accquantences, we don’t talk at all but follow each other on social media. But here’s the thing, when you post things on social media about how you are ready to kill your self or how depressed you are and you don’t even get a text asking if you’re okay- does that mean no one cares? I see them caring about other people but they never seen to make sure if I’m okay. I mean I don’t expect them to, but I know when I see people that I care about talking like that I need to make sure that they’re okay. I mean, how can you say you’re friends with someone but not even say anything when they’re threatening to kill the selves. It’s weird, you’ll be Sauk g how much you want to die and how depressed you are and no one will say anything BUT they’ll make sure to send you a picture on Snapchat to keep the streak lol. Worthy enough for a number on Snapchat but not worthy enough to live in their eyes

Sorry for the rant, just wondering if anyone is expierencing this or idk.
