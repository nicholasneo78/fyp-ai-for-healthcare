Well, I guess, i mean i know I need help. I lost my husband . he died of a heart attack at 56 on his walk home from a police station from being arrested for soliciting a prostitute., two years ago, can't get over it. It was a bad scene, we were not great lovers or anything like that, more like companions, he cheated on me a lot and i just accepted it, but we did things together, ate out a lot, went to flea markets, he was nice to me, he loved me , he was just stupid, and i wouldn't have sex with him because of his indiscretion, I think he understood that.

After he died, about 6 months or so, I started going to a psychiatrist. He put me on lots of medications, it cost a lot of money, I was still depressed somewhat and really, I don't think he understood me at all. So about 6 months ago, I quit, everything, medications, therapy, etc.

I have a 30 year old son that lives with me and causes me a lot of grief, he has diabetes really bad and no job. Two days ago he was lethargic and his blood sugar was 500, I had to take him to the ER and I know it's going to cost me thousands of dollars. I have no extra money, but what does a person do. I tried to get him to get a job and it just turns into a yelling crying i am going to through you out of the house thing ... He is my child, I won't throw him out , .. oh, he also has adult ADD.

I have a real hard time socializing because i have low self esteem, I am fat, 53 years old, not very attractive, and on and on. When I try to improve myself, I get frustrated, the weight , .... etc.

I think about suicide but that is stupid, I never act on anything like that. It's just a passing though time to time. I cry a lot, I am alone a lot.

All messed up huh.
