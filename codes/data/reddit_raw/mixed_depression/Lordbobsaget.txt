Just tied a noose
I just looked up some videos and learned to tie a noose. Suicide is all I can think of right now and I'm scared to do it only because the thought of becoming a vegetable and having to live like that terrifies me. I guess this is one more step I'm trying out to kind of ease myself into the whole thing.

People told me 10 years ago to stick with it because it'll get better. They still tell me that even though I would love to go back 10 years now because of how much worse its gotten and how much better even that was compared to now. I didn't think it would get this bad but it did.

I've been through so many medications, doctors, checked myself into a hospital 3 times when I was sure I was going to do kill myself, called the suicide hotline several times, talked with friends, made lifestyle changes and all that. It still didn't work. I've only gotten more depressed.

There's no helping me. I am just supposed to feel miserable. I'll never be happy. I'm not sure at this point if I even want to be happy anyways.

Hoping I can work up the courage to kill myself by the end of today. I'm really scared to do it but its something I really need to do for my own sake.
