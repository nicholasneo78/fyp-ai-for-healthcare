Hello, my name is Joe and I have been battling some form of depression, but I do not know what type or how severe it is. I have a family history of bipolar depression but I am not sure if this is a disease that is genetic to such an extent. Does it skip generations? My moods swing from euphoria to deep depression to where I contemplate just cutting away from my life and vanish. I am not suicidal; just feel at times isolation is the answer. I have one trigger I know of and it is usually when I am lacking in knowledge of a current situation I may be in. This make sense? Like tonight, I am out of town on business and working very late on some complex worksheets. I started getting depressed after the 12th hour of working and getting nowhere. This will then lead to insomnia and I will once again, for the second night in a row, be up all night working and mind wandering contemplating just getting in my car and driving to a remote town and re-invent myself. I have tried professional help, but to no avail I am just as bad if not worse. I figured since I am online most the day I would search for a forum that might lead me on a better path. After all shucking corn in Nebraska for room and board isn't such a great option the next morning. Well thank you for this opportunity to at least get this off my mind for at least tonight.
