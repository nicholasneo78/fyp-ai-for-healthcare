I have so much to say and don't know where to start......

Let's see I am in a relationship with a man who is not the same guy I met before he was so caring and always wanted to give me affection. Now all he can seem to do is drink and constantly want to fight. He has become to the point where everything I do is monitored he checks my cell phone to see who has called, checks my EMails to see who wrote, calls me 2 - 3 a day to see what I am doing, won't "allow" me to go over to my friend's house, who I have known for almost 20 years, without him being there, and checks the history on the computer to see what web sites I visited. Now I have NEVER cheated on him, and I always find wrong in what he is doing. Some days I just wish he would leave, but other days all I  seem to hope is that  he will change. Every one of my friends thinks that he should go since he is getting physical, but he is my security. I don't work and I can stay home with my 7 month old baby he provides for us, and the baby isn't his. If he goes how do I do it ? If he stays will he change? I have tried to talk to him, but all he says is that I am never happy. I need to grow up and stop acting like a kid .... I want to smile again I don't want to be controlled, but I want him?  Someone please HELP !!!!!!!!

I do ask  MOM for a lot of help, but I don't think that is too kid like........

I can be a B word, but only if I am mad about something he won't help me on ........ I want a day to myself, a night to go out with friends, but he won't watch my son. Even though I watch his 3 year old every day 7 days a week so that he can provide for our family ....

Sorry I could go on forever, but I think that you get the point ....... By the way I am a 25 year old in case you are wondering????

Will you help me PLEASE !!!!!
