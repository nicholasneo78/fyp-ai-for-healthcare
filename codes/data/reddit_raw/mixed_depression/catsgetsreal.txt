I Want to Scream Until It Stops and the World Makes Sense Again (update)
A few good days had me fooled into thinking I had control over myself and my life. The only thing holding back from suicide is my mother and how much killing myself would fuck her up. But she's in her 60's and as soon as she's gone, I don't see anything else holding me back from following after. I just want to stop existing. I just want it all to stop.
