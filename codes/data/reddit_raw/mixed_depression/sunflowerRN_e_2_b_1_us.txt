Hello All, I'm a 27 year old female from PA. I've been dealing with severe depression since my early 20's. I recently had two friends tell me that they think I may be bipolar. Hmm… I'll have to disagree. I don't really have "highs." At least not anymore. Mostly just feel like blah. Sometimes it's so bad I think things would be better if I wasn't around. I would never commit suicide, but it doesn't stop the thoughts from clouding my head. I've had the therapy and been on medicines... celexa, paxil, combo of celexa and lamictal, lexapro, wellbutrin. NOTHING. I'm not taking anything right now, but am in the process of looking for a new therapist as my insurance recently changed. This sucks. Most of the time I feel nothing. Empty. I find it easier to get emotional and cry over a stupid TV show than over something in real life. Well, it's good to be here. Hopefully it'll help.
