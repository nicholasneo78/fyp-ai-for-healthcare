 Well, last night it stormed something fierce. Thunder, lightning and tons of rain. It sure made a nice evening to crochet. I finished with the 6th square now, and have started the one with the cluster braid. It is not hard at all, and seems to be going fairly quickly. I like this part. I will try to finish this one today. I have a terrible headache, so I don't know how much I will get to do.  I am working on my squares in the order, going down the left, in strips. Once I have 9 squares done, in the first row, I will attach them together and begin to really see some progress. It only has 7 strips, so once you get one done, it will go smoothly from then on out.  Well, until next time - happy crocheting from my hook to yours!
