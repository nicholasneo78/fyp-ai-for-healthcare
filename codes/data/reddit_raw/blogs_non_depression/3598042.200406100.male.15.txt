 Today I woke up at 10:20 and as usual went downstairs to watch a little TV. Then I came upstairs to go on the Internet. I've currently been online for 49 minutues. I don't know what I will be doing today. I think I might go pay my phone bill, other than that, watch TV  , go online. You can't even go outside because its raining and dark out. Oh well.  Later.  P.S. Oh yea! I'm going to watch the finals basketball game tonight. GO PISTONS!!!!  GAME UPDATE: The Pistons beat the Lakers by 20 points! And the Lakers got the lowest score ever in game three!!!! (Updated 10:54 p.m.)
