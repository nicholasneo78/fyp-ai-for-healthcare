 Francis is my name, and i am a beginner bassist. Trying my best to practise for my one a biggest dream! That is to form a band with my friends. We target english rock, though i myself prefer chinese and jap rock. But through my friends' persuation, I decided to try it out. It's hard to enter the english rock market, cos nevertheless, white skins hate the yellow skinned, thus therefore they will definitely not support. Without the white skinned market, it's hard, god damn hard.     Ok, enough of my dreams, now to introduce myself further. I am a 17 year old chinese boy, sporting black short hair, little funky hairstyle, i'll try and post my pictures later. I'm not studying, cos i need to work for money to fuel my dreams. I'm around 1.7 to 1.74 metres tall, about 55 kg. I like to sing, play soccer, snooker, use the computer, slack, smoke, do nothing but dream all day long. I play the bass and I like to go shopping around with my friends.     I'm new to the blog stuff, so if anyone can help out, please do so by mailing me at  urlLink dreamz@pure-fm.net . Thnx alot.     About today, its my off day at work, so i've been slacking at home, and also practising my bass. Doesn't get anywhere better. Met up with my friend to discuss about our songs. currently, we've produced 4 songs of our own. Not too bad for a start. Got really excited and we discussed our plans to get more attention from the public. How we intend to let the public know us. Haven't found a name for our group, and we only consists of 3 people. A guitarist, a bassist and a perfect drummer. He's the best! Haha. Basically, thats all we've got. We're looking for a good male vocalist, or even a second guitarist. Anyone with music talent and wanna be in a rock band, willing to share expenses, ups and downs and experiences  can mail me too. I'll arrange a meet up. No harm trying ryte? Ok, Thats about it. I'll update more later. Bye!
