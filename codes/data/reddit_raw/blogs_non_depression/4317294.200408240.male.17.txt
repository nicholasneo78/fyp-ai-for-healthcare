 So my other writtings talk about this alwsome girl. We'll I really like her and I won't to take our realtionship to the next level. Right now we are like just talking. But I would like to ask her out. But right now she is confused. I really don't understand why thou. I know about this guy that like's her, but she's told me that there just friend's and she wouldn't date him. So I don't think thats that she is confused about, unless she does like him, but I trust her. I just don't understand. I keep praying that God will just be there and help me and guid me in all I do. I just don't won't to pressure her and lose her like I have in last realtionships. She is just so awsome, and I don't won't to lose her. She is like every thing I have ever wonted.
