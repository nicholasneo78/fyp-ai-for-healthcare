 The Fall of the Pure  A tear falls from my eye Into the sea Where has it gone? This thing called humanity My tear is lost In the great abiss of purity where dwells a style so sweet and free The swells of sweetest revelry  where friends are not lost and love doesn't end where the signs of the time are not peoples' sins where hatred and darkness are not known where the beautiful are not alone  it lightens up each soul with truth and all are hearkened to the light of youth such in these souls  is purity a neverending  and lovely chastity  but while man reigns so does hate it floods our souls and swells over the gates the purity wanes the truth wavers the hate holds fast and we await a saviour  When will he come to take away our doubt For all this pain Can't be what existance is about What light he giveth me I pass to you And hope that your soul Will to hope hold true
