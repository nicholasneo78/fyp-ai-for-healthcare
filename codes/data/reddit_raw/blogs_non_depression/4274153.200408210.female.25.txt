 Mom has really irritated me all day. She won't stay away from here computer long enough to pet me but 5 or 6 times. She forgot to put ice in my water bowl and then yelled at me when I tried to lick the ice in her cup. She forgot to leave the TV on when she left earlier so I had nothing to watch while she was gone.  And what really got my tail in a knot? Well Mom and Grandma sat here and watched some make fun of cats show right in front of me. As if I wasn't even in the room. I mean geez what do they think, I don't have feelings?  I think I will knead her arm extra hard tonight.  Meow!
