 I am a French born Hong-Kong guy. I have always wondered what my life could have been if I was not born here but there.   I have always wondered what would my life be if I grew up with people of "my kind", if people stopped asking about my origins and more about me.  I have just started a new job after a year where I have been mostly doing nothing but having fun, meeting people and having a heartache. Heartache ? Yes, I kind of left my heart in Hong-Kong the last time I went there in December 2003. I stayed there for a month and a half and found out I really enjoy the life there.   Really I do, even if it is harder to leave in Hong Kong than in Lyon (France). Even if work is tougher, even if I would spend more time commuting, even if I would have less money.  I think like I belong there, I don't read nor write Chinese but I speak Cantonese. I kind of feel alive there.  Is it because each time I have been there was on vacation ? Maybe. Now I want to try the real life there.  I have to stop hesitating.   Last time I was there, I attended a wedding. This time, I will also attend a wedding of very close relatives.  I often listen to a radio show from RTHK 2, Mak sir is on the mic and always says : Never give up ! From his point of view, anyone can start over from nothing any time in his life. I agree with him.  With everything I like about HK, why do I hesitate so much ? Am I affraid to leave my family ? Maybe. Am I affraid to fail my endeavour ? Maybe. Do I have th guts to do it ? Yes. Do I have money to do it ? Not quite.  I have to make up my mind in the next couple of months.
