 QRF (Quick Reaction Force) for those who are not in the military the job of QRF is to be the first responser to any threats happens on camp.  QRF night, like most of my QRF duty I spend hours looking at the night sky. QRF is lame and that shows you how much action this camp gets. Well Iraqi night sky is nice its almost as nice as the Hawai'i night sky. Of couse hawai'i is at a much higher location. The city just don't know what they are missing. I just wish I have a camra that could take picture of the stars so I could show it to people back home. As I lay on top of my hmmvv staring upward at the sky I easy counted hundreds of stars. However I wasn't bore enough to name them. Even thought I feel that they needed names. About an hour into endless staring I notice stuff are flying across the sky. They look like tracer rounds. I was like wow we are under attack. But hmm.... they look like they are 300 miles up in the air. Than I was like well they are shooting no were need us so I just watch the growing stuff flying 300 mile over me for 3 more hours. By the way I did see few huge growing flying stuff fly across the sky. That could of be a missile or a meteor burst. If its a meteor I am going to name it "shooting cock shit".
