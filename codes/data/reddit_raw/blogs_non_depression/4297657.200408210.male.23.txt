 For those of you who know me reasonably well, you might have known that last thursday was my 23rd birthday. Now I'll admit, it wasn't exacltly the star filled night of enjoyment that I hoped for but hey, you can't have everything. But I did, as I do every year, made my new years resolutions that night because for me, the 19th of august is my new year. I decided to have these as my resolutions:  1.Do a couple of pages of notes or one page of new writing everyday.  2.Actually start wearing the nice clothing that people buy for me, and even experiment with a colour that isn't black.  3.Socialise quite a bit more often.  What do you guys think?  What resolutions have you guys ever made?  Josh
