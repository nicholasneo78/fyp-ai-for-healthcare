 There is a group of boys i had always en vious  some of them is in my class. Their releationship had been so close, u can always see them hanging out together during recess, after school anytime. Even if they quarrel they will patch back in a few days and their friendship will still be the same as before or even better. They had the kind of friendship that i always dream of but their friendship is being tested again and i think it is reaili bad this time. I hope here that they will get though this too as it wasn't easy to find friends that thinks alike.
