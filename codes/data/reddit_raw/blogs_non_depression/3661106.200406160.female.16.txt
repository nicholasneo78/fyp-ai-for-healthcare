 Well, this isn't exactly poetry, but I'm just not feeling very inspired at the moment.  Of course, that could be due to the fact that it is 2:33 AM where I am currently located.  Anything I try to type that isn't planned will most likely not be coherent.  I'm very tired, but I don't really feel like sleeping.  Strange.  I'll probably sleep in tomorrow until 12 and then be a pain in the ass all day.  Such is life.  Anyways, I'm going to attempt sleep.  I'll put up a poem tomorrow or something.
