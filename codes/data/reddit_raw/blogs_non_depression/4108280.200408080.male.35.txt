 Still, I can’t put myself to really use this blog as a personal public viewed journal. I believe that a journal and its content should be private. I think a person who blogs is either a boastful person or a person who is just lazy to use a pen or, a person who’s penmanship is so bad that even he/she could not recognize his/her writing. In any case, each person has his/her own opinion about the matter and I should respect that even if I don’t like it.
