 I just got a packet for the new private school I'm going to and the dress code is REALLY strict. I mean, the girls can't wear pink! We can't have heavy make-up on or short skirts. I am actually reconsidering my choice. I guess I'll have to think some more. If you peeps have any comments about it or some advice, please let me know. Love Always, Chloe
