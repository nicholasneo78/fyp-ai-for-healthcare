 Well, I know it’s been a little while since I last spoke, but I’m extrodinarily lazy, so it’s ok...  All five of you are probably wondering who it was that responded to my last post.  That would be my girlfriend *hears in the background “awww...”*.  Anyways, from the time I last posted, not much has happened.  On Wednesday, I got pulled over by a cop on my Vino Scooter(which in VA doesn’t require a license), he pulled me over and asked for my ID, which I readily supplied; he looke it over and said he had no problem with me.  He then proceded to say that he’s had complaints about mopeds in the area(a motoscooter is classified as a moped here) and he also wanted to warn me about a new law passed a few days ago requiring all moped drivers to carry an ID with Name, Address, and Birthdate.  I said ok and sped off on my merry way.  I wouldn’t have had so much trouble with him if he hadn’t blared his siren at me.  Anyways, on Saturday, I went to Tyson’s Corner Mall(The local really expensive mall) for about half a day.  I went up and was going to go to a few classes at the Apple Store.  I attended half of one and the others never happened.  No real big deal for me, but I really wanted to attend those, and now I will never have the chance *sniff*.  Ah well, such is life.  Anyways, Tuesday is Medallio’s Birthday, if anyone in the area knows her and reads this blog, wish her a happy birthday.  Goodnight and may Eris stay the Heck away from you,  David
