 Baby I still love you but that don’t mean much   Despite the ways I’ve loved you you just can’t be touched   I need to know, why you don’t love me back   I need you so...    Why do I keep hoping that someday you’ll change   When matters of the heart just can’t be arranged   I need to let go, I know you’ll never love me back   I need it to be so but you’ll never give me that    I don’t want to feel it anymore   I don’t want to find myself outside your door   I don’t want to give my heart away   Not for free, not for one more day   So make it go away   Just make it go away    Every time I see you I just catch my breath   It hurts to know that I don’t have that same effect   I need you to feel, the way you make me feel   I need it to be real but it never will    I don’t want to feel it anymore   I don’t want to find myself outside your door   I don’t want to give my heart away   Not for free when you don’t love me   So make it go away    So make it go, go away   I don’t want to feel it anymore   So make it go, go away   So make it go away    Baby I still love you but that don’t mean much...
