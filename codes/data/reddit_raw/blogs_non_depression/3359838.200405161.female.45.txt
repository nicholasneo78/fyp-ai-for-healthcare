 I have a lot of kids, the fur baby kind. I love each and every pet I meet. That doesn't necessarily mean that I WANT each and everyone that I meet, because I don't. I believe that they all need to have their OWN homes where they are special. To me they are all special. It can be very hard to make all the cats  feel  special and I do try to make them feel that way. I don't like to see them broken hearted when a new one arrives. That causes me stress. Sometimes new arrivals require alot of attention and the other cats get their feelings hurt and start to shy away. That breaks my heart too. Plain fact is that I need help. I need foster parents to take in orphaned babies so they can be adopted. At work we get so many calls of people finding orphaned kittens and the shelters here are full. I can't take them because my sancutary cats have been exposed to FIP. If they come here they have to stay forever. I already found 5 orphaned kittens myself. I had no where to send them so now they are here to stay. Anyone out there want to help bottle feed babies? If you do and live in Pensacola, FL call me: 261-0760 or 492-6878. I will start a list and give notice at work that I have foster families! That would be too cool! Those of us that work in a Vet Office, we are there because we LOVE what we do and we LOVE animals. Believe me, the pay isn't that great! We have our hearts broken weekly and sometimes several times a day. It is an emotional business, protecting and saving lives.
