 God, it seems like no matter how hard I try there's nothing right in this world for me to hang on to...  Everything is so fubar.  What I wouldn't give to just go back to Italy!  Everything here in the states is so...  Arrogant and so brisque!  I suppose it doesn't really help that I'm in the middle of nowhere, but still.  The people of Napoli were better.  And they didn't give me the troubles that women here do.  No matter what, I can't seem to decide.  M, with her amazing beauty and sweet innocence, as opposed to N, with her attractive playfullness and OBVIOUS willingness, or B who I could have for as long as I wanted to be there, with a hug and with support, and to love me, but with intimacy extending only as far a kiss at the end of a date...  How do I decide what's more important?
