 i've got a lot to do this end of the year, and its not all that fun.  looking forward to having time to play the guitar a lot.  Fix up my blues, get the band working like the complex machine we should be.  I hope we can end up playing the quest.  i am listening to muddy waters.  What a guy.  If being sad is that soulful, i think i'll give it a shot.  This is strange, i feel like the closer i get to summer a certain feeling of nostalgia for the future occurs, even though it hasnt happened yet. sorry if that didnt make sense.      and his count of magical items had diminished by one...
