 Woke up early to take my nephew to KKH for physiology. He is so adorable!! Came back home and later in the afternoon went for my hair appointment for free hair dye. And i have got free shampoo and conditioner too! Hehe.. Afterward I went to collect my cheque from the company for my pay. Went to coffee bean to sit and have coffee while waiting for my ex-colleguage. She was going to meet a prudential guy called george, so i tag along with them. In the end, went to China Jump to have dinner. Its indeed a very nice environment. It was my fourth time went there.  Later in the nite, Went to visit my friend at Tan Tock Seng Hopsital. After that we sent to relax and sit at the pool side to talk. This is the first time i have revealed some much about myself.
