 You lil' ass! I told you not to tell Dest what I had said! Now she hates me more than before, oh well i guess. I can't be angry, no matter how hard i try i can't do it. Well, not at least since me and Abie got together. (Abie, if you are reading this, I love you, Baby!) The only thing I can be is happy . . . Is that a good thing?!? If not it sure feels like it! Garrett, I may not be angry with you, but I'll still kick your ass, you lil' bitch! Now I know i can't tell you anything, without it being repeated! That's depressing, or it would be if I wasn't thinking about Abie . . .
