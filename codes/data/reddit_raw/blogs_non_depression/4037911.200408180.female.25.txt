 Maybe I'm too nice, but it would be hilarious to bust someone out when they are yapping on and on about nothing but lies.  It's the same bullshit over and over again.  Save your saliva.  No one wants to hear it anymore.  It's old.  It's lame.  And most importantly, nobody's impressed.  Obviously they've never heard of that ghetto phrase, "you ain't gotta lie to kick it."  And yes, I'm somewhat of a bitch.  Tell me something I don't know already.
