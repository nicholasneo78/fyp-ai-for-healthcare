 Wouldn't it be sad if from the time we were born we knew exactly where we would end up in life? I personally don't believe in fate, but it might just be because I don't want to think that I don't have control in the outcome and direction of my own personal life. I enjoy being able to think that if I wanted to, I could completely change everything, and nothing would be predetermined.  But at the same time I can't help but wonder if my life will end up the same way no matter what.
