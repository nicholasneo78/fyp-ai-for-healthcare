 It is around 2:00 a.m. and I am just sitting here on the couch with my dog, who is asleep, watching a little Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  Debating on whether to go to sleep or shoot off a firecracker or 2.  Haven't decided on what to do.  Husband is at work and we need to decide on a house to buy.  Decisions and so many other things to do...
