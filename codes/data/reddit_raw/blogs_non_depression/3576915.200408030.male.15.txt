 Hey all.  I know i haven't been online for ages, and i'm probably a little slow on the uptake of things, but now it's time to catch up.  If i hurt you with what i say then that's too bad. Enjoy.  Let's start with: me. Surprise, surprise. i'm human. i'm not infallible. i know i can be a jerk. and believe me, i hate myself more than anyone ever will. Pst Mike's service has impacted many people, and i'm no exception. On our own we are nothing. God makes us who we are.  Next: Adam. Don't be ignorant. make everything you do deliberate, and assume responsibility if you've done wrong.  Timothy Wan. If at first you don't succeed, try again. even God can't please everyone. patience is the mother of virtue.  Brendan. Very glad you're learning stuff. whatever it is, it's time to grow up. don't take offence so easily. be proud of what God has made you, and use it as your edge.  You can't control the wind, but you can adjust your sail.   Juliana. If you can't say anything good, then it's probably not worth saying. don't be ignorant; you're not stupid. things only make you angry when you remember them. the best revenge is to  forget .  If i'm wrong about something, feel free to call to hurl obscenities at me. oh look, my sense of humour is back.
