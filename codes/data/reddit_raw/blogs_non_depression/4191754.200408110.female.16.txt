 Came back from school today, felt so tired. Evonne nowadays very good to me, like treat me as a close fren like that. Wonder why, when i have never even talk to her when she was in school. Oh, i knew her when she was in school, but it's like, I know her name but i never tried to talk to her. Her bdae and Hanson bdae just passed. Wished both of them the happiest bdae ever.  Missed marcus alot. Never imagines that it would be so hard not to hear his voice telling me to take care and that he loves me. Michelle told me that she wonders why marcus broke with me when obviously he still care alot for me. Frankly, i also don't know. But, i'll be waiting. he promised me that he won't let me down. I'm scared i'll turn out to be something like michelle in the end. But... i'll cross the bridge when i come to it.  I'll end here today. Bye...
