 There are two days left until my school closes for the summer. I have two more days of pointless classes, as we've finished the year up already. A party in Deutsch I and I have to listen to speeches on controversial topics in World Studies, and I suppose I have to write a speech tonight so that I can give it tomorrow. I should get doing the research now, because it'll take awhile, but I have other, more pressing matters, like writing in my blog, vacuuming my room, changing my cat's litter, all that good stuff. And finding my remote. I was watching one of the newschannels, and the news guy was interviewing this woman on the recent phenomenon in America of organization, with shows like Clean Sweep, and stuff, and she was talking about how people spend a certain amount of time everyday looking for something when they could be doing something that they really want to do, and while she was saying that, I was desperately looking for my remote. It was ironic. I still need to find that remote.
