 Elizabeth and I took a tube from Morden to Aldgate East. Had a marvelous vergetable curry with the most fragrant rice I have ever had.  Not bad for 8 quid for both of us. Now this was like entering a foreign country.  In the middle of London and even THE GRAFITTI WAS IN ARABIC.  Wow.... Birgitte joined us after several calls on cell phones : Where are you....I can't SEE you  (well no, we we trying on shoes INSIDE a shop).  Shopper Unanimous reunited.  I was soooo proud of myself, walked through a whole market and entered three shops without getting out credit cards or cash.  Nothing I fancied, that helped.  Instead I spend my birthday money on my friends.  Found the Graduate Art exhibition spread out over the whole old Truman Brewery site.  Fantastic stuff there.  Goldsmith was easy to find (thank you Adam for telling me they would be there).  One particular college we found by mistake got 1st prize from me : one guy had build a totally pointless contraption and when I asked him WHY he answered 'Cos is it pointless'.  I LOVE IT.  He  now wants to add on to it but can't because he has run out of space at home.  Ultimate stress beater.    Never found the Surrey lot :-(  Definitely going to the next one.  Legs are knackered, tomorrow I will pay the very very painful price.  Was it worth it...oh yes.  God bless.  J
