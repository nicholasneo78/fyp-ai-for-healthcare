 Dear who ever wants to read this       I am writing this to enlighten you as to the scam that happens to be sms.ac.  I am sure that who ever is reading this has received the email from a friend telling you to sign up for this "great offer of 6 FREE sms's per day" tempting, but i was as sure that it was a scam as i am sure that megan wont be capable of sitting down after saturday night.  So i closed the email and not long after found out that tens of my class mates had signed up for the "deal". To be fair here are some pros and cons   reasons for joining sms.ac   1. The "FREE" deal is obviously great value! 2. I wouldnt want to commit the clear social suicide that is not answering my friends sms's! 3. I have to keep my friends updated with inane jabbering!   resons not to join sms.ac   1. reading the terms and conditions.   Had anyone of these people decided to read the terms and conditions i would not have had to endure them complain about the $6 charge for "Infomessages". I got exactly 13 messages telling me to join this site, these emails were sent to countless others, and no doubt a fair few of them joined up for this quality deal! suckers. i feel no pity for you, let this teach you the lesson READ THE FINE PRINT   Todays resolution: The majority of humanity are idiots, however there are a few outstanding citizens leading the pack and unfortunately the majorty of them hail from my school. Enjoy freedom while you can, once they arte released on society they will effectively crush the small part of sane humanity that is left with inane infomercials and "GREAT DEALS"   USE YOUR TIME WISELY, THERE IS NOT MUCH OF IT LEFT   faithfully sane...                   cube
