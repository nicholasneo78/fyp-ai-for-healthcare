 Well I can tell that it's summer now. I've already slept into 12:00 pm one day, I've stayed up till 2:00 am and I'm waiting to pull an allnighter.  It's starting to get really hot outside, man am I happy that we have a pool. Not that I use it that much. But if I ever need to I know that it is there. O yeah, I saw Shrek 2 it was awsome. There are still some movies that I wanna see. Well I'll post some more stuff later.
