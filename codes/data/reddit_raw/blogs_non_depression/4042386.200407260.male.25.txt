 NP:  Axel Rudi Pell - Legions of Hell  Well, this marks my first blog entry. My track record generally isn't too good with these things, when it comes to updating them, but, eh. What the hell.  Anyway, went job hunting today. Not very promising. Probably gonna suck in my pride and try Walmart on wed. Anything is better than I have now. I have tried for them in the past. Hope my luck shall be different this time.  I will be putting my Resume' online at hmas.org in the near future if anyone reading this wants to check it out and hire me ;)  -Reno
