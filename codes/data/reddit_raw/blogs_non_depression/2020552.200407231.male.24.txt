 This week was somewhat of a breakthrough in the jobsearch.  I even got an offer for a job I had to refuse.  On Tuesday I got two phonecalls.  One was from Turning the Page, an organization that does professional development for teachers and connects communities to schools.  They were calling for a second interview.  The other was from Hispanic CREO, a group that advocates for school choice reforms.  They offered me a (well) paid internship until something else comes up.   I had my TTP interview yesterday, and I think it went really well.  I don't want to count my eggs before they hatch, though.  I have no idea what my competition looks like!
