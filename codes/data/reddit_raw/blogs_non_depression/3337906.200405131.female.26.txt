 Hi.eyeryone. I'm going to tell you about me. I'm a 26-year-old Korean girl in Seoul, Korea.  The reason for making this blog is that i want to make friends. Although i'm not good at english, i want to be a good friend to anyone who live in Seoul or somewhere...ah! and i studied in Mlebourne, Australia 2002. After studying, I have been working at KBS in Yoido as a web designer. If you want to know more, just come by my another site on web -http://www.cyworld.com/bangsilko - it called 'mini hompy' in Korea, like blog. You cae see my too many photos and some writing about something.^^
