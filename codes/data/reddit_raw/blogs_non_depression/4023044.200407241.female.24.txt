 This has been a difficult year. Friends have moved away; health has been poor; job satisfaction slim to none. But changes are brewing . . .  I quit my job of three years. I need to move on and give myself time to heal. The transition will be difficult (for me and for the organization) but it's long overdue.  Maybe I need an outlet.  Maybe I need to write.  Maybe I'll do it here.
