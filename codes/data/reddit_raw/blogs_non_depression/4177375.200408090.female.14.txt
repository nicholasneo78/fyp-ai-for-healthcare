 Today.. it was actually hot out.. I woke up late.. then tanned and hung around pretty much the whole day.. I got reading alot also.. I have a correction - I have actually read one book. Now I have started another.. but still I'm not doing good with my reading.. cuz I hate it.  I miss Brittany and Sammers.. they are gone until Wednesday.. and I'm not gunna see them because I am leaving on that day. I hope they have fun.. and I'll see them after that fo' sho'.. mwahaa  I also miss Heather.. she is in Albany and I am sending her mail tomorrow to make her unbored.. haha I am such a good friend!.. When she gets back we are going to go to the movies cuz we both really want to see the Notebook.. and it is at the strand.. yeah.   Song of the day -   Franz Ferdinand - take me out   -Good song.. but easily gets stuck in your head..-
