 Today was a regular school day. I got to school and survived through Mr.Perez going on about Jewish law. Then I went to Web Design and watched a pretty interesting video on the history of the internet. After a short break I showed up for Biology and did really good on our quiz. Thats when things started going down hill. When I got into fourth period I had a really bad headache. Then at lunch by the time i got my food it was time to go to class. Spanish and Algebra were easy. Then came AVID. I had to listen to my new AVID teacher talk about how things are going to be different this year. We've been going over this for the past four days. It's getting pretty old. Well after that I came home did my homework and started on this. Thats about everything that happened to me today.
