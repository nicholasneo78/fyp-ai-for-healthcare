 Try not to cry Don't let the pain show When your fears hurt the most Just let them go No regrets You told me with a smile But I didn't listen I still cry  You live a life Doubtless and free of pain and worry 'free of misery' I wish I could live by your wise creed but I can't block emotion It won't let go of me  I look up to your wisdom I admire your strength But I can't follow your footsteps For I am still week A fledgling of truth Yet living in lies this is the lifestyle you so despise  This is written for my cousin Harrison, who though he is 6 months younger than me, has always been a sort of mentor.  He's there for me in tough times and gives me advice on what I need advice on the most, life.
