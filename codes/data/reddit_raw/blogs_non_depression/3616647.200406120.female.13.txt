 i hate this i am hiding this life the real me and no body knows it i wish they did then they would ask me to talk to say what i want to say and then i could stop saying jst what they want to hear and mabye i could say what i want to hear and then mabye i would be happy with my self i wish i were me and not what they want to see it is sssooooo anoying trying to act like this just so they  can be happy of corse this kinda what every body wants for me to try and ft in and hid the real me because i go agaonst everything that my parents wanted me to be i hate every thing that  they hold so dear like stupid basseball ur camping or fishing.  they say that i have pinko liberal ideas what evr that means but i thnk that what i havve to say is right i think that we should try  to save the whales instead of helping themon thier way to extinction and they say it merely nature well it isnt it is more than that it is killing what god has so graciously given to us and putting it to ite death that isnt how they see it but that is how i do which is just one way thatwe are differnt
