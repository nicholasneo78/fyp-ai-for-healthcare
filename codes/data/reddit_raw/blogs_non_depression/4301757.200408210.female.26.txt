 but it's Saturday and i have zero to do. being able to be lazy can be such a relief.  the only thing i've done today is change the batterys in my remote and nap. the evening is approaching and i am trying to decide if i should actually get dressed today and socialize. Beth and Mark are having a party tonight, which is always fun. i'm kinda in the mood for something new. maybe i'm just in the mood for someone new..........  i think i'll drink some tea and sit on the couch some more
