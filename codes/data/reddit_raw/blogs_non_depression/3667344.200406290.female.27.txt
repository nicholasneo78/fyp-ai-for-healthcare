 I am starting to really see and respect the work that I perform as a mother to my son...why can't others see raising and taking care of children as a job?  No, we don't get paid for it (we damn well should!) and there's no equipment to use or an office or shop to go to, but taking care of children is definitely a large responsibility! Especially if you choose to exclusively breastfeed...for 10 months...  Does "he" respect me as a mother, as a person he is involved with, and as a woman?!? At this moment, on this day, I truly question if the answer is yes...
