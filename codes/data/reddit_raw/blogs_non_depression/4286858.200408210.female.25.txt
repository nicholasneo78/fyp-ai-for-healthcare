 Well friends, it wasn't pretty but, after 3 hrs. of sleep I dragged my sorry butt out of bed to take on the mean streets of Venice, CA.  I joined my friends Samaya and Bianca to start training for the marathon.  We're part of a group called the L.A. Roadrunners (original, I know).  Do to a knee injury, I just walked today. Regardless, I'm very excited about everything going on over the next 6 months leading up to the race.  After training, we went on over to Robeck's (in the Nut) to toast our first day with shots of wheatgrass.  We even have our picture plastered on their wall.  It's not even noon yet and I've already had quite an eventful day.  Look for another post later today.  Until then, it's nap time!
