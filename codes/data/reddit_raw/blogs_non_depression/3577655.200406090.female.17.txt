 As some of you might have known I had an interview with Dierburgs and it went really well. But today I got a letter from them saying Thanks but No Thanks. I guess its back to job hunting for me. This really sucks I was so ready and I really needed it too. Totally of subject here but would those stupid telemarketers (no clue how to spell) please stop calling us, were on the no call list thingy.  Later
