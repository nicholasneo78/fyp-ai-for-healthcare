 I'm all alone in my house tonight... I'm planning to get round to doing one of the many projects I have stuck in my head. I might start work on the weed community forum Highgrounds that I've been planning to do for ages. Or I could finally sort out my music collection and tag all the songs properly, so I can put them on CD's. But more then likely I'll go watch ' urlLink Fight Club ' and once again spend a night sat doing sweet fuck all.  N2S [Note 2 Self]: Compulsory revision tomorrow... Don't lie to yourself.
