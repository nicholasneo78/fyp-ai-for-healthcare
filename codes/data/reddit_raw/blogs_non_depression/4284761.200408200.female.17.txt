 Woo Hoo tonight is girls night! Since the bf is out of town! I'm going to watch Princess Diaries 2 with my mom, two of my friends and their moms. Then the girls are spending the night here. We definately will have a good time. Maybe I'll tell them about this. They could start one too. Maybe we could do one of those team things. My boyfriend called from Canada yesterday evening, he is on vacation. We only talked for a little bit because it will be really expensive on his cell phone. He said he was having a good time. I'm happy for him, but I miss him!!     Maybe I'll have time to write about our fun time later tonight. Or I will just wait until tomorrow. I know how bad everyone wants to read this.....yeah right!!!
