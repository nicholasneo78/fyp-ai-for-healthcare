 i think i have a fairly violent and destructive nature, the other day i saw a work line of ants crossing this little path in my garden, you know all in a little line carrying leaves and other small pieces of debris to there nest.   so i decided- without conscious control or empirical decision making- to follow the line and find this magical nest of ants and well, to destroy them. its not as if im a child still so there was no real explorative adventure kiddy stuff, just the pleasure of destroying their city.  so i went to the garage- found a high pressure vacuum suction hose attachment and pressurised some diesel fuel into there home, i was quite surprised as about a gallon went in, along with a flaming book of matches- and i threw a bible in just for good measure- good kindling really, nice thin pages. anyway so this massive jet of fire shoots out and almost cooks me, and the most satisfying part was that NO ants came back out, i let the ones working in the chain across the path live just so they could go and tell the other colonies what had happened.  i was quite disturbed by the enjoyment i got out of the whole thing, but well the world is full of wierdo's that do a lot more worse stuff, so im ok, right?
