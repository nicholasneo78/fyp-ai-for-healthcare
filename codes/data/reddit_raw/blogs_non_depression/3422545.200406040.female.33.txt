 It's been 2 weeks, and still I long to be kissed on both cheeks when I meet someone! I want to turn around and go straight back to Paris.   But the ad agency where I work (www.adbiz.com) suddenly has more work coming in, and I've got two new projects on the go for freelance this week. One is search engine writing for a cosmetic surgeon's website. Another, an ad for building insurance. A lot more like this, and I'll be back in France in no time.  I've started on a couple more articles, about onsens and enkais in Japan and the glories of NS in the summer. But I have yet to finish one, since the paid stuff is taking up my time. That, and badminton! We started a club here in Gainesville, and we played for the first time two nights ago. It was fun. Some competitive people there, but for the most part, we just blissed out getting all sweaty (no a/c) and hitting the bird around.  Although it threw me for a loop when my French friend went to kiss me on the cheek instead of shaking hands after our first game. I got a little shy and forgot to do the second cheek. So we just resorted to the regular hand-shaking after that.
