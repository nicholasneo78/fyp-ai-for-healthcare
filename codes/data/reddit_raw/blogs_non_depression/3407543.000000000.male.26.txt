 It is amazing how the time of lunch comes so slowly. At work the time seems so relative, that I feel like I understand Einstein's theory of relativity, and I could even make my own contribution if I hadn't been so hungy. Sugar levels are dropping. Concentration diminishing.  As I correctly predicted the weekend was indeed cold and rainy and on the weather side really nasty. I have seen all types of rain on that day, and I do not care to see them that soon again. But otherwise the weekend was great. I was training my fiancee in driving on our fresh new car and on Sunday we went to see Kill Bill vol. 2 to another country and it was good.  Today my sister is doing university graduation exams and it seems to be going well. Not for me though, because it is hard to type when you are keeping your fingers crossed :-)
