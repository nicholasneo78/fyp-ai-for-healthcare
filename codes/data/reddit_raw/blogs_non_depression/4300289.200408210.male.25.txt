 Hey ... my name's JJ and this is my online diary.  A couple years back, I used to publish this journal on urbanboys.com, which no longer exists.  Basically, I chronicled my "sexcapades" and those of my friends.  It was a lot of fun, and it helped me to meet a LOT of great guys ... guys that I will be friends with for life.  But, it was VERY time consuming.  I'm thinking using Blogger will make it much easier, and I've decided to give it another try.  I'll also use this journal to keep you updated on what's going on with my other sites (like  urlLink http://urbanboys.blogspot.com  and  urlLink http://urbanboyoftheweek.blogspot.com ) and how things are going in general with me.  So, not just sex sex sex this time :-)  But, I'm sure there'll be plenty of that, cuz I'm still addicted! (Hahaha)
