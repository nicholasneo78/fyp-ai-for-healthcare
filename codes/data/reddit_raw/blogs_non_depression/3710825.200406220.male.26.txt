 Some times when i wake up i think that....yes today is my day and hence forth all those lazy habits must be a long forgotten dream and for the next five minutes i lie there planning my whole future.... well then after 5 min everything is gone and then the evil part takes control over the great brain... and after a while you feel that you are gone too deep and the shore looks like a distant dream...this is the flip side of the story...  Why.. why... why... why... why... i keep reading this everywhere and its keep hitting in my head all the while but then what the... whatâ€™s life with out all these hangama..       Life's been on a marathon and as the day passes its like we need to run faster and faster or the world would leave you behind...Gosh and this rat race has made gone from wild to crazy...and when it comes to some thing no one has time.. Well then i guess that's life... life is sooo.....
