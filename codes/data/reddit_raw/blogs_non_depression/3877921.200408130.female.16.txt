 By  Sixpence None the Richer      I'm going nowhere and I'm going to take my time    All the questions in the world I can leave in my mind    I'm waiting on the sunshine, the sunshine       I'm waiting for answers  I'm waiting to figure it out  I trip on my chances  I slip through my doubt    I'm going nowhere and I'm going to take my time    all the questions in the world I can leave in my mind    I'm waiting on the sunshine, the sunshine the sunshine        well it seems that my weakness  is sometimes my only strength  and in my incompleteness  you get your way    I'll be around   and I will find my way back down  and I'll see the sound of the sun     I'm going nowhere and I'm going to take my time    all the questions in the world I can leave in my mind    I'm waiting on the sunshine, the sunshine        the sunshine
