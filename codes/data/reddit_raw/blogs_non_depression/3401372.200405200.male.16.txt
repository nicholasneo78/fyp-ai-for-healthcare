 Why is it that when ever something goes wrong or when there is some one to blame I seem to be the one every one turns to. I don't know if it is just me or if there is othere people who feel this way. For me it is hard to deal with and its sad to say, but i'm actullay not looking forward to summer vaction. Summer vaction for me is usually the worst for me because I live a way from all of my friends which means i get to spend the time with my family. The happest for me would probley be at school when i'm around people who don't judge me. My friends known or I try to remind them that what i say that is mean is just kinding around, but thats different here with my family. To me it seems that know matter what i do or what i say i feel like I can never do anything right. I'm not trying to make it seem like my life is all bad or anyhting like that I have good times and bad times but for me it seems that the bad happens more often then the good.
