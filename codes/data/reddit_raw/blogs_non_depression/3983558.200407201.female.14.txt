 Starting sunday. I can't remember what i did but i guess it wasn't to important. Monday I Started going through my clothes and shoes to get rid of them. I have to send half of my clothes to my mom cuz i will be going to wyoming this week. and i don't wanna take all of my stuff, cuz i got to much. trust me. but other than that, i went to the store with my grandpa to get food then later that night, we went to wolly world (walmart) to get stuff for the pool cuz it's dirty. then today i started packing the stuff i will be bringing to wyoming. And now i am really bored so i guess i will end this here. well i will write another day, hopefully soon.    ~littlebear200~
