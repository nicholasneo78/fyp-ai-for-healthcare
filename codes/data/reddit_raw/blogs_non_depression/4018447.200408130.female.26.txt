 Friday the thirteenth! I forget to post for weeks and I remember on friday the thirteenth.   Can I just say I am so sick of people being so against breastfeeding!!! What is wrong with doing something that my body is meant to do? I hate how formula companies have put the idea in people's minds that it is this amazingly great thing. UGH!
