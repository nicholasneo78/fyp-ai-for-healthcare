WTF!??!   Oh and i saw the 'other' her today... like we were staring at eachother, she was in the car passing and i was at the bus stop... and im like thats not her... cant be... wtf it is her??? and i didnt wave.. haha oh well i guess i can bring it up with her at school and turn it into something swanky if it was or was not her...   Like 'Hey did i see you yesterday?? Oh not you huh? Coz i saw this damned beautiful girl in a white 4wheel and i could have sworn it was you!"   OR   "Hey did i see you yesterday?? Oh man i thought so! But then again i thought i was seeing things, and would have looked like a knob if it wasnt you"   Okay so.. if it wasnt her it will work better but anyways IM SCREWED BACK TO BEING SCREWED
