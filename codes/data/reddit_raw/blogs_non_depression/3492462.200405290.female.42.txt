 Well I finally got around to trying out this blogger- even though I've had the google toobar for ages, *and* was a loyal googler long before that.  Silly me.  I first tried to blog with a different blogger site, and To Tell You The Truth, I didn't like the feel.  Oh, it was simple enough, if awkward, but the 'home' page of the blogging site was so darn busy I felt lost there.     This place is so much better. I should have gone with what I knew was a tried and true service.  Anyways, this is my dumping ground.  Stuff I find on the internet that I must squawk about (good and bad), late night frustrations and nightmares, and the occasional proud parenting moment (or self flaggellation over same)-- all will be posted here so I can embarrass my family and bore strangers.  I hope you'll drop in occasionally.
