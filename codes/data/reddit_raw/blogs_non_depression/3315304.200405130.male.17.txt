 Someone finally told Dest how they really felt other than me, that makes me so incredibly happy! I’m not sure who said it, but Lydia had something to add to it. She said to Dest, “You’re a sweet girl, you just need to shut your fucking mouth!” Garrett, I’m sorry that I’m saying all this, but this is how I really feel. Dest made me sooo damn mad today; she was talking about how she hates when people talk bad about other people behind their bavks, but she was doing the same damn thing to Michelle. And Michelle is the last damn person I would stand up for, but Dest pissed me off sooo fucking bad! All I hate to say when I walked into the RamPage office was HYPOCRITE and Dod so completely agreed with me. I know I’m a hypocrite, but if I ever get as bad as Dest I hope someone tells me or knocks the hell out of me, one or the other!
