 As I've said before I wish I could make my words as beautiful as yours. You inspired me to as least try. To express myself whatever way I could. I know our time together was short...I know I will take you with me where ever I go. And I'm pretty sure you'll do the same. But, I do feel cheated! Cheated because this fantastic person is being taken from me as soon as I found her.
