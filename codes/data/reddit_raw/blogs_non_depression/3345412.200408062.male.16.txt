 This is my first post of what will hopefully be many. I was contemplating writing a blog for about 2 weeks but I fiqured I ain't got anything to lose. I plan on writing about anything thats of interest to me and somethings that don't. This blogs really just for me to keep a record of anything interesting but its free to read by others so if your here now you might as well read on. Generally i'll be going on about websites if checked out, music i've heard, games i've played and some non-specific bullshit. There isn't much else to say on the subject...
