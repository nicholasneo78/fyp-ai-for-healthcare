 Today was a good day...i went to church, learned some good stuff...and i saw you there.  You were setting there, as beautiful as ever, and i was happy.  Later everyone went to the lake, i enjoyed that, espacially the service, were i sat in your shadow.  If you only cared for me the way i do for you...ohh, what a love that would be.  I've been waiting for a while, but that doesn't matter, my feelings for you haven't dissapated, i doubt they will.  Your the first person i think of when i wake up, and the first person i pray for, before i sleep....what a love this could be.  countless hours spent dreaming of you, but whats sad, is that your in love with another, and there is nothing i can do to stop it.  But all in all, today was a good day.
