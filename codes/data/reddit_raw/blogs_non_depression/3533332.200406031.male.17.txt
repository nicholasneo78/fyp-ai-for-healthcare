 Alright, this is my first Blog post. So, I guess i'll write about what happened today. Well, just like the res of this week, I went to sleep at 4a.m. thanks to my damn headaches. So, I missed school, again. I supposed it can't be helped with all my damn problems, and the operation I had last week but anyway.   I got exams next week! Not good, I only started studying an hour ago, and the exam's on Monday. Of course, i've always been one to procrastinate with my work and studying, it's just that now I have an excuse as to why i'm going to fail! Sigh!   This weirdo called "Yen-Po" wants to come to my house. He's this weird homosexual with alot of issues. I'm not sure I want to see him because he said he "wants to see me" which conjures up some pretty vivid images in my sick little mind.   I had a really weird dream last night. I was at the cinema, eating popcorn. Out of no where i'm sleeping in a bed with some weirdo and they are holding a cane. At that point I woke up, and then when I went back to sleep I had rather enjoyable dreams about my school, and how I was causing it mass destruction. Ahh, the joys of an unconcious mind.  Well, this is it for my first post, i'll be back later - Kalinixta.
