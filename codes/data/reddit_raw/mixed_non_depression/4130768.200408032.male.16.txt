 Sorry I haven't been on here in a couple of days. School started, so there ya' go. Anywho! There are some things that we just need to catch up on. Like....school started today! This could have not been a worse day ever! I mean, it's awesome that I have every class with Anthony Roland. He is cool and all, but he was picking on me all day.....Expecally in Stiles' class. And then Kyle and Robert had to join him. I mean, sure. One person can only take so much, but this was past the bar line. And then, what pissed me off the most, was that when I was drinking the water out of the bottle, Robert just had to tip the bottle up, so it got all over me! Yeah, I was pissed!!! I still am! I mean, how come he did this?! I don't know...I'm all puzzled by this all.
