How can I deal with my clingy friend?
So, me and this girl have been friends for 5 or 6 years and I hadn't noticed any clingy behavior from her up until last year. She always wants to hang out with me everyday and if I say I don't want to she will beg me because she knows 9 times out of 10 I will cave in. I've had to come up with elaborate lies to avoid hanging out with her which has resulted in her changing her social media bios to "friends don't lie". I want to continue to be friends with her but I don't know how to get her to stop this behavior without hurting her feelings.
