 Today when I woke up, I got yelled at by my dad over the phone for oversleeping. He told me that I had to go and make something for my sisters to eat, because they are hungry! I was like tired, because I had like stayed up till 3 am trying to fix my damn ghetto computer. I made something for them to eat, but one of them didn't want to eat. I got so pissed and I made her eat. She ate it and everything went fine. Then I decided to fix my computer and I tried installing another version of XP on it. It almost broke down. I was so totally freaked out! I mean god damn! Then Thomas had to call and I had to go over to Sloan's house cause he just got a multi tap. (like I cared if i he just got one!). Well I went anywayz and had a really lame time. I am not really good at video games, I mean fighting games. We then played an NBA game and I totally sucked at it. I suck at the real thing, what makes them think that I could play a fake version? When I got home, my computer was fixed and I was happy. But then I had to defrag it and I was pissed. Then I went to the upstairs computer and I started to type in my blog! I had to fix the internet connection first. While typing this, the TV said that Linkin Park has a new video coming out and it is one of my favorite songs. "breaking the habit" and there is a making the video at 6 pm tomorrow (i think) and I am totally psyched that they have a new video! So now i feel bored.  OMG it is a linkin park video and i am totally wanting to watch it, damn, my mom turnt it away! DARN!! Well, i dont like that vid much anyways. I have to defrag this computer now, S'later pplz!
