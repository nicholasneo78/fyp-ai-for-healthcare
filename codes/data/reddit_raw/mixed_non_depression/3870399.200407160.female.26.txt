 While my husband is laying comfy in our bed I went to a  board that he frequents a lot.  As I was looking for some threads to post in I found a couple of disturbing ones that he had posted in.  Needless to say, I don't feel very wifely or womanly after seeing what he had posted.  I actually cried.  It makes me feel like he doesn't want me anymore even though I know that is not the case.  I just can't believe that he posted it and all that crap.  I don't know what to do or feel right now. I don't know whether to be angery or ball my eyes out.
