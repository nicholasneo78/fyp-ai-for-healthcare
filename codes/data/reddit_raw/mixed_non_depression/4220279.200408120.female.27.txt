 I'm just tired of being in this constant state of flux. Nothing is ever enough and nothing is ever right. I want it all and I want it to be better than the last time. I don't really know why I am doing this, but, I suppose I just need to start opening up my life. I need to be ready for the next step, no matter what that is.  I feel so trite.  How did happiness and  enough  ever become a bad thing? When did I become conditioned to want and feel that want become "need"? Again, it almost hurts that I'm so transparent. Yet, I say nothing. Ironic. I guess that transparent is the wrong word...More like childish, silly and empty. Nothing new to say, nothing new to share, just raw.
