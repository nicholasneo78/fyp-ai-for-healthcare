Leapfrogger/Friend Stealer/Friend Poacher etc.
Just for some context in my form group (like a morning register class or a house class as some call it) I sat at a table with people I didn't really talk to, but since I couldn't change seats I decided to make some friends with people at the table.

In grade/year 8 or 9 I met two guys who are now great friends of mine, one I talk to more than the other since he stayed at home instead of at school due to health issues. Fast forward a few months and you have the situation above. So I started talking about a common interest with this guy we shall name Manny, now Manny and I only talked in form, and after I would go back to my main social circle with my best mate. After a while (about grade 9-10 maybe) I decided Manny should go and chat with me and my best mate's social circle for once, so introduced them both to each other, and they got on well.

Now between year 10-11 I definitely noticed that Manny started taking more of my best mates interest, which makes sense and happens often so I didn't think of it. It only caught my attention when my best mate stopped inviting me to events such as hangouts at the park and going on cinema trips with my other friend who stays at home. Instead he would invite Manny and Manny would invite him and some of my other friends to many events like the cinema and sleepovers and whatnot. Over time I would be completely excluded from my friends activities and everytime invited them to do something, they would say "im not sure if i can go" only for me to find out they went with Manny somewhere.

Sure we are all still friends but I feel like i'm being slowly excluded. Is this just me? What do you all think?
