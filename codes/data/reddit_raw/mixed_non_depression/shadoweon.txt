My mom went to go to a family gathering (I didn't go) and one of my aunt's seems to have forgotten my name. Is it reasonable to be bothered by this?
I don't see my dad's side of the family that much after I moved because its a long commute. However we still send out Christmas  cards and two of them call from time to time. 

One of my Aunts was having a retirement party and my mom went to it out of obligation more than out of wanting to. The Aunt who the party was for was welcoming and nice to her but the rest were just talking amongst themselves about politics and other crap.

One of my other Aunts who lives outside of the area (compared to us and the others) went up to my mom and said hi to her but when she asked about me she said "How's your daughter?".  Everyone else who asked about me asked about me by name,so my mom took notice of this and found it odd.

She told me about it when she got home and it bothered me. I was the flowergirl in the wedding for this particular Aunt, so I don't see how she could not even remember my name anymore.  Is it reasonable to be bothered by this?

I used to send them christmas cards (and I signed my name) but they haven't sent anything back in recent years. I don't feel like bothering to even try now. They send us things asking for money for their kids school from time to time but nothing else.
