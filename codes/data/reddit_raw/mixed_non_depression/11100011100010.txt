The divorce talk
The wife and I have had a very empty and distant relationship over the last few years.  After a couple of very difficult circumstances in our lives we sought counseling several times which didn't help at all so we resigned ourselves to being basically roommates for the sake of our children.  Neither of us cheated BTW or at least I didn't.

We decided to talk last evening and alot came out.  We're ready to call it quits.  I knew the relationship was dead but thought we would eventually come around.  I love her and am committed to her.  She "loves me but is not in love with me" anymore.  I'm scared of what this will do to our kids the oldest is very sensitive.

We decided to try a thing. We're going give ourselves X months and set aside time every evening to really talk about the things that bother us, the things that brought us to this situation, what we fear for it kids, what we want for our lives, all of it while doing it best to accept/not judge the other person.  We have not really spoken to each other like this since before the kids so this may help.

If this doesn't change the relationship we'll decide whether we'll separate or divorce.  I have not told her this but I will be considering the option of suicide since I feel it would be easier for the children to cope with my death than to give them any reason to believe it was in any way their fault.
