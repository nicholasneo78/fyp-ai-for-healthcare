My sister wants to have an intervention with our parents about their marriage.
So my sister and I are both adults. I'm 29 and she is 26. Neither of us live at home anymore. I have my ~~only~~ own little nuclear family now and she is renovating a house with her long time boyfriend. Since we have been adults we have noticed that our parents marriage isn't exactly happy. Our parents are basically polar opposites. Dad is a really outgoing people person who likes to have lots of activities and friends. However, he is very very emotional and can blow up at the slightest hint of "disrespect." If something is wrong it is never his fault, you know the type. Mom is quiet and reserved, not much on physical or verbal affection at all. Her only hobby/activity is through music ministry at our church. My dad joined the church when they got married, but he isn't religious really and only comes on the holidays. Lately my sister has been really distressed by our parents relationship. She is very empathetic and it really upsets her when they fight. So much so, that she does not want to be around them anymore because of it. Today she told me that she thinks we should have some sort of intervention with them about their marriage. My sister and I have discussed before that they probably should really be divorced, but that it will never happen because our mom is Catholic. I think an "intervention" would just make it worse because I know my dad will see it as a personal attack. I'm of the "it's none of my business" persuasion but I don't want to miss out on family time with my parents and sister. We all get together every couple of weeks at my parents house for dinner and board games, which I love. I don't want to lose that. Any thoughts? Is there anyway to approach our parents without making it worse?
