 Hopefully, you have figured out that my "theme" is William Shakespeare's  As You Like It . I, of course, am Rosalind, the strong-willed, independant young woman and Orlando is my lover. He left this morning and I was trying to find a way to dispense my emotions. I thought this would be much more exciting than a journal.    As I mentioned he left this morning. It is the strangest feeling for him to be so distant. Orlando holds in his chest the other half of my soul. I feel empty without him. They say "absence makes the heart grow fonder." I hope this is just a little bump in the cobble-stone street. We have been together for 3 years. Most couples are married by that time, but our ages keep us waiting. We are still young and must establish our careers first. I have small doubt that our love will fail, I just hope my Orlando will not be tempted by an Eve to eat (or whatever else) a forbidden fruit.   If the fruit is "consumed" I will be left with no other choice but to close the gates of Eden, not matter the pain. But once again, I have small doubt. Our love is strong and shall brave the elements! I love Orlando...as he does me.   But "True is it that we have seen better days." -William Shakespeare,  As You Like It
