 Well today is Augest 14 and this is the first posting of my first blog ever and I will write alot everyday so check back every night for some reading if your bored! Well first let me tell you a bit about me and where I live... My name is Trevor Nederlof I'm 15 and I live in a town called Westport which is in connecticut. I have a younger brother (Andrew) who is 13 as well as a black lab (Chloe) who is 10. We just moved to a new house near a river which goes through our small sized town. I am a geek because I love computers but at the same time I have a strong love for sailing... every type of boat may it be 10-150 feet I have done it all and love every moment of it.                 Last night I saw Aliens Vs. Predator which was a great action movie and I recommend it to everyone. Then I woke up at 3am to watch my cousins boyfriend artor  row in the olympics on a 2 man boat. I was tired when I awoke at 8am I started to unpack my room and help my cousin Jake who works for my mom take alot of the boxes from our move to the dump in town. I met my best friend David Brenner  (Everyone calls him Brenner) in town and we rode on bikes back to my house where we watched Da Alie G Show which is the funniest show EVER. After Brenner left I basicly just played computer games while helping my aunt and grandmother with the boxes from the move. Well Pizza will be here soon so I should go...           Look forward everynight by 8pm est (1 am GMT) I will post on my blog and I hope you all share with others so they to can read my life lol. Until tomarrow enjoy life because you only live once :)
