 Geuss what? I just realised how great I am at reviewing movies. Remember when I saw that one about the British ravers who contacted the undead via an Oujia [I've never had to spell that word] board? The one about the kids who snorted coke [cocaine, for those of you who aren't Ma-, er, down with the street speak] off train tracks when, wait for it, A TRAIN WAS COMING?  I also liked how they had sex, and the girl's shirt was on inside out for the rest of the film. Oh, but I wish I had seen all of it. Obviously, something that starts off like that must have a grand finale. But my mum wrestled the remote off me with a stern "No more tacky B-grade films about British punks!"  But they weren't punks, mum. They were ravers.  The whole experiance left me hungary for more B-grade films. The 'B' in 'B- grade' stands for 'Brilliant', right? Oh, good. Anyway- Blurred.   IT HAD EVERYTHING.  A deformed freak who picked up hitchikers, playing a recording of a woman having multiple orgasms, in his wagon of death?  Hillbillies eating lasange?  Threesomes in a limo? The driver wearing a cocktail dress?  A stripper-hating nerd who fails to find true love?  Some ugly bitch who picked up an even uglier bitch [male, this time] and attempts sex with him? Several times?  Gothic girls on acid?  One of those great endings where they freeze on the face of each character and the text at the bottom of the screen tells you what happened to them after "schoolies"?  IT. HAD. EVERYTHING. Am I one to be sarcastic? Exactly. See this film. Or the first one I raved about. Hahaha -RAVED.  Until the next time I go wild at the video store...
