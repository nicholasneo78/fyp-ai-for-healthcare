 Wow. Today was a very hard day for me because I had to stop being friends with one of my best friends because it was an unhealthy friendship. But I'm glad that I did it. It took me a long time to realize that it was an unhealthy friendship because I was in denial.  But even my friends and family kept telling me that I need to break it off because it was affecting me in such a radical way. I will always remember him.
