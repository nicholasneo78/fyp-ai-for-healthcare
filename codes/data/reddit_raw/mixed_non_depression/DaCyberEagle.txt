Moving out however I have questions and preparations need to be made
Hello I am 17 and live in the state of PA... I will be turning 18 soon and I plan on moving out of my dad’s house to move in with my mom and change schools for my senior year. I essentially plan on cutting complete contact with him as he has outlived his usefulness and we have not got along anyway however I do have a few questions I wanna bring up that some of you may be able to answer.

- He is currently in possession of important documentation I don’t want him to have such as various copies of important things like birth certificate, social security, medical stuff, etc. I plan on swiping these anyway from him. However, I want to know if he can legally withhold the info from me.

-Can he ever at anytime get copies of various personally information of mine without me knowing or without my consent as an adult?

-He said in the past you are still a minor if one is still in high-school. This is probably a stupid question but I will ask it.

-When I go to enroll into a new high-school would I need anyone or since I am 18 could I just do it myself.

These are just a few a the questions I have and will probably make a follow up post In the future if anymore questions I come across need to be answers or can at least get feedback.
