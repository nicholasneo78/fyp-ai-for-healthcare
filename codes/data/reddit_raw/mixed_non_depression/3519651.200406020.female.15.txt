 Hey ya'll! Today was MUCH better than yesterday! Well, I didn't let things get to me as much as I did yesterday! Anyway, its kinda funny. Well the other day, Monday I think, me and Ryan Larson were throwing a plastic bottle on the bus and I threw it at him and it went out the window instead cause I missed. the bus driver didn't turn it in till today, and I got called up to the office during first period. I dont care though, I only got a hour of ASD. Its my first time too so its not that big of a deal. But the thing that pisses me off is that Ryan didn't get ANYTHING! He was flicking me with a rubber band! Hmmm...well what else happened? I had the oral in spanish today, it was easy. After school Ashley came over. It was so funny, we were wired! She's the best friend ever! I can't wait till the weekend. I'm not sure what I'm doing on Friday night, but Saturday I haveta go to a cousins wedding in South Carolina. It'll be fun! Sunday is Ashleys birthday so hopefully we can hang out.    Well I hope ya'll had a good way too! Just think...6 more days left of school! YAY! I'm excited! Love ya'll! MWAH :-*
