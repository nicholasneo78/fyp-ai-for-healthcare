 Through time all the conflict in society essentially boils down to either greed, power,  or a difference in opinions otherwise unresolvable. From the biggest wars to a fight on the playground it's always one of those 3 things. So you might be wondering what the hell that has to do with anything. My point out of that is that conflict is inevitable and necessary. I can't stand people who think everyone should just tolerate everything even if it conflicts with their own personal views. That's like telling me I should hold out my hands and let someone take a shit on them and like it. Do you have to agree with me, Hell No! Do I have to agree with you, Hell No! What if we just can't come to an agreement............then it's time for a fight! I do have to tell you something.........while you were picking daisys and doing drugs and watching TV.........I was working out, eating right and learning how to fight. So when the shit hits the fan and conflict is inevitable who's side would you rather be on?
