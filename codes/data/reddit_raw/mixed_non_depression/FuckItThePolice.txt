I am socially awkward and I find it so hard to get close to people?
I have very few friends. Basically one good friend and a bunch of people that i started to become friends with but i haven't been able to get close to. I have no idea how to become close to people and make friends and I am getting more and more depressed by the day. It feels like no one likes me, and I have absolutely no idea if thats the depression talking or if thats the truth and I am depressed because i finally realized that. I am so confused and I don't know what to change and what is stopping me from becoming better friends with people. I don't know if I am an unlikable person or if I am just really awkward and that is what repels people. I don't know what kind of an answer I am looking for, but I just need something to give me hope, like for something i can change or do to give me confidence to talk to people. Thanks for any answers, anything helps.
