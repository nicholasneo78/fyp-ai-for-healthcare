My friends acting dumb and I don’t know what to do?
So I have a “friend”. Let’s call this “friend” B. I’ve known B for most of my school life (we didn’t talk from K to 5th grade bc different classes and moving away). In 6th grade she was the only friend I had in academic classes and we both formed a squad (spoiler: it didn’t last). Essentially we were very close and have a lot of inside jokes.

Starting last April, B started ignoring me after I told her I wanted to do an assignment sheet alone. She took it the wrong way and we ended up fighting the entire break. We made up quickly and life was normal again. Another long ass fight happened over the summer for unknown reason. Then in November, I saw B at Target with someone she hated (lets call her E) at the time (B still does). What pissed me off that B fucking cat-fished E the same week. Again, made up 2 weeks later.

She’s probably the only friend that actually asks to hang out with me (I have other friends btw). B likes to play these ditching pranks when I would leave then B and her other friends would leave me. She’s also destroyed my stuff after I told her no. One of my other friends (let’s call her A) told me that she was obsessed with me that every time when hanging out with B, B would mention me and it creeps me out. I don’t know how to deal with the friendship since I’m scared to deal with B. Any advice?

TLDR: My friend is toxic and obsessed with me. I don’t know how to break it off without hurting her feelings?
