 It's the middle of summer and I can't sleep, I haven't talk to my friends in a while I wonder what they been up to. Anyways I've leaned something this summer about me. One thing being why I feel depressed and why I get irritate easily. I've discovered that when I'm not with a crowd of people I don't feel depressed or get irritate easily. Which is like my brother which sucks because all school is a crowd of basically adults acting like 6 year olds.
