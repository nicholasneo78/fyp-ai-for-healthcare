 To Whom It May Concern~ I am writing a formal apologie to a certain someone who I need to make peace with. This person should know who I am talking about...I wanted to say sorry about yesterday. I didn't mean anything in a bad way and when I was leaving your house I said goodbye and you ignored me. I just want to make peace because it was over something that I said that wasn't meant in a bad way at all. Call me please!!
