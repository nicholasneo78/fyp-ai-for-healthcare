Female reasoning
Why does it seem most women try to justify or get approval of a friendship with a male by stating knowing then for a lengthy time. Do women truly feel that no platonic boundaries will be broken because they’ve “known each other for 15 years/since freshman year” etc. 
I don’t believe it impossible for a platonic opposite sex friendship, but I do feel it is much harder for a male, for several reasons. Men typically seem to misinterpret a female being nice as expressing interest or flirting, that can easily plant the seed for a romantic attraction to develop. A mans “natural desires” and wants, can easily blur the lines, and when in the right environment/setting they feel it is acceptable to attempt something etc etc. 
I don’t see how whatever length of time negates the possibility of anything happening. 

Do women honestly feel because of a long friendship ensures its innocence? Or just an excuse/reason given in an attempt to “justify” or have that friendship accepted by their significant other.
