Friend dumps problems on me and that’s all we do together now
Interested in other peoples experience of this and suggestions!

Have been friends with a woman for a few years.  Started off fun, we’d go for lunch, gigs and talk about a whole range of topics in person and by text. 

For the last 6 months she’s stopped meeting up with me and responding to messages (or sending any). Instead she calls me at least once every week for often 2 - 3 hours asking for advice about men, her job and other stresses. She’ll talk for over 20 mins uninterrupted, won’t stop talking when I need to go and will call even if I’ve said I’ll be out or unavailable. 

I got married oversees recently and our conversation was 10 mins on this and the remaining 2 hours about her problems. 

She gets aggressive if I don’t offer a solution but when I cave and suggest another way of looking at things she throws it back in my face. She will often cite conversations with others where she’s gotten into an argument, and for hours will push me to give an opinion as to what she did wrong and when I diplomatically suggest doing something different or how maybe the other person didn’t mean it how it came across she will say I don’t defend her and make passive aggressive remarks. She’ll ask me to make decisions and then complains of it doesn’t give her the result she wanted!

It’s confusing and really draining. Not mention all the fun parts of our friendship have slipped away and now I’m left with her constantly calling. If I don’t pick up she just keep ringing everyday! In fact I moved House once and she complained she had withdrawals from our calls. 

Feel pretty used as she has little to no consideration of my feelings or boundaries. In fact once on a call with her I received a text saying my grandmother had died, she just said she had to go and never mentioned it again, not even to ask how I was doing. 

Would you say anything or just cut ties given how sensitive she seems?
