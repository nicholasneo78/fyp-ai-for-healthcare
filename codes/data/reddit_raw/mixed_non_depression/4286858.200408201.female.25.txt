 Well, I've never done a "blog" before so you'll have to grade me on a curve.  Today was another fun visit to the dentist.  Turns out, that tooth #27 (yes, it's that specific) needed a root canal.  To really be able to focus on that particular tooth, my dentist found it neccesary to use a dental dam.  All I could think of was sex ed. in high school talking about dental dams for oral sex.  If anyone I was with pulled out a dental dam, I wouldn't be able to run away fast enough.  My day was quite uneventful otherwise. Other news:  I am missing someone that is very important in my life. Recently, I had to "restrict" a friendship with someone I care deeply about because her fiance isn't such a big fan of me.  It really sucks but I know that things will work out for the best and that nothing is impossible :) Until next time, God bless and good night.
