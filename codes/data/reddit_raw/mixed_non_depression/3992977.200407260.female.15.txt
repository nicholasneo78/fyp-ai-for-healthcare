 My favoriter character is   t i g g e r  and   scooby   doo. They have very   funny attitude.   Scooby   is a very brave dog, how he be standing upto all those monsters is amazing and crazy.   T i g g e r  he is so amazing to how he bonce on his tail. He is the color of one of my favorite colors   Orange .  They be having some crazy adventures. I be scared for them. When I get like eighty something i'm still going to be watching them, i'm not never going to get tired of watching them. Well Bye
