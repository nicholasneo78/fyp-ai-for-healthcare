Difficult Family Members
I am pretty annoyed I have a large family 8 kids and my mother in law is visiting to take care of placing her mother who lives near us in a memory care home. This is fine, but when my sister in law found out she was driving distance away she decided she was going to come up for a week stay at my home with her 6 kids. So we got stuck acomidating all these people in our home for a week. She didn't ask she just told my mother in law she was coming in 3 days. Didn't offer to help pay for the enormous 300 dollar grocery bill and basically took over the lower level of my home. Now she is gone Serously pissed. Am I wrong to so annoyed. There is reunion coming up and I was going to tell every one hell to the no is anyone staying here again.
