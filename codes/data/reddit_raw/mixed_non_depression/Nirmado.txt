How do I get my Best Friend back..
Last year me and one of my Best friend decided to get into a relationship.. it lasted a couple of months and she got disturbed due to some personal problems and i made a mistake of not giving her space as obviously I was worried as a boyfriend and also the best friend because she won't share what happened to her  and truly it was something bad..
We both had an amazing Friendship of 6 years before that and there may not have been a single day that went by without talking to each other.. its like she became an integral part of my life..
But after she started to distance herself from the relationship I did keep bothering her which was a mistake on my part and I did apologize to her for that.. 
she kept blocking and unblocking me since then and I tried my best to get back our friendship as it matters to me more than a relationship as out of the few people who truly know me and are as important as the organs of my body she is one of them..
and as we know even without one organ a person feels Handicapped as I do now...
Yes it might be selfish of me as I am the only one who wants the friendship to be like before.. all of my attempts have failed so far.. but its next to impossible to not think of her as she was my routine for past 6 years..
and I too tried the regular methods suggested everywhere like cutting contact, getting busy, etc but at the end of the day you always have some time for yourself and in that time her thoughts always come to my mind...
