 My opinion on peoples   faith   is   different  . I dont think that anyone can determine how much faith someone has, and I dont think that other people should   judge   someone elses faith. God is apart of   everyone's life   one way or another.   Mostly   everyone knows who God is and the principles behind Him. I think that the way that people   deny   Christ's name so easily is  wrong , but Im not them, so I cant make their decisions for them. But what I can do, is I can work my hardest to be a Godly   example   so that they can see what the Christian life is all about. Being a Christian   isnt   always   fun  . Yes, there are always the occansionally   disappointment   that we run into and from what I have heard, alot of people   blame God   for their   mishaps  . Well, as hard as this might sound, its all apart of God's   master plan  . God allows some misfortunes to happen, to   test   your level of faith that you might have in Him.   BUT  , know this, God will   never   test you with more than you can   handle  .  Beliving in  Christianity  or  Evolution . Either one that you believe in  requires   faith!   Faith- believing in something that you cannot see.
