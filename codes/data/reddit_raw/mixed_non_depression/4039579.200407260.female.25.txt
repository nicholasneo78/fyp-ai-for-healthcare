 After much encouragement from my tech-savvy boyfriend, I’ve decided to get on board with the concept of blogging. As a writer, it only makes sense that I find an outlet to document my thoughts. However, I still kinda feel like Doogie Houser at the end of an episode when he would type a couple of sentences on his old school computer to both sum up his day and offer some sort of introspective look at the universe. Remember how he would always pause right before the last few words? That lame theme music would play as he contemplated the perfect vocabulary to capture the essence of his experience. And then he would always type the last couple of words r-e-a-l-l-y s-l-o-w-l-y. I guess that was a primitive form of blogging.   I still find the concept of putting your thoughts out for the world to read intimidating and intriguing. I mean, why would anyone care what I had for breakfast or thought of a movie I had recently seen? I guess it’s just like having a diary, but how personal can a blog get if you know everyone can read it? Regardless, I feel that writing for leisure again instead of just for work will be a positive experience for me.
