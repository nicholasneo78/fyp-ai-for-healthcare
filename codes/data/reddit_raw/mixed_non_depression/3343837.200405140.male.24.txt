 Ever notice how the end of the school year is both exhilarating and a real let down? I spend an entire year teaching students to be better thinkers, writers, and people, yet only some of this shows through. Your high achievers get better, some of your middle achievers improve, and a lot of students just stay the same.  Behavior is at an all time low at this point too. Since my fifth graders don't have finals, thye've been tuning me out for the last three weeks. It's terrible. Although there is little I can do about it, I just hope that something of the knowledge and behavior skills that I taught remain with them. Maybe my modeling good behavior might just rub off on them in the long run. Who knows? Anyway, it has been a long year and I am ready for it to end. Thank God it ends next week!
