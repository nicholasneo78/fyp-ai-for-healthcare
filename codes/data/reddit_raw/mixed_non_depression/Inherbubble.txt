Why doesn't this person doesn't like me?
I met this girl through my best friend and we were cool and cordial with each other. Months later, I said "hey" to her and she thinks I was being rude or mean to her but I wasn't at all. My friend tells me that she doesn't like anymore and wants to fight me (for no reason). I haven't saw her in months and I thought she would be passed the situation but apparently she's not. She wants to create fake drama between us and tell lies because she doesn't have a good reason to fight me or not be cool with me no more. She thinks i have an issue with her but she's the one who has it with me OVER NOTHING. Why is she doing all of this?
