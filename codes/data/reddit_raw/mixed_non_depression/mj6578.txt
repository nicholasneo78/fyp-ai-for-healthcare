Losing my brother
My brother died suddenly Friday night. He was 38. He was pretty much estranged from most of the family, spent some years making bad decisions and doing drugs and it caught up to him. He was trying to straighten out his life and cut out drugs and negative friends, from what I’d heard. He was in the ICU recently with heart failure and pneumonia. We talked while he was in the hospital, a lot of apologies and crying and encouragement, just a brother and sister having a conversation. The next day his blood pressure was supposedly good enough for him to be released. 10 days later, he was gone. 
My family members are taking it in their own ways. We all had unresolved things, a relationship we were hoping to rekindle, a bond I wanted to forge again with my big brother. He was my best friend and hero growing up. My biggest challenge as an adult. I feel so much regret and heartache over this, I can’t even begin to explain. He didn’t have an easy life. We lost a lot, he went through a lot, some of it was because of his choices, I really feel he was trying to make it right but it was just too late. We lost our grandpa and dad in the last 2 years, now my brother who was the first born grandson. I don’t think I’ll ever get over this.
