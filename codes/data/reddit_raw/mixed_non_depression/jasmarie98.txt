Went through tough times, friends weren't there, but I still want them in my life.
I have 2 best friends from high school since we were young.
Long story short, we were the best of friends, had a great friendship and were really good to each other.
We are all 19 now, and I went through a bad time the end of last year, my brother was shot in the shoulder as a accident at work, and had alot of issues with my childhood come up.
The only difference with my friends and I is that I grew up in a completely different way then they did , I was raised in foster care, that was tough, I grew up poor and had many bad things happen during that time, on the other hand they had very loving parents and a great home.
 They dont seem to understand some of those things and find it hard to understand why I am the way I am sometimes I need my space and need to be by myself, Being in a foster care that had terrible people in it, I never had celebrated birthdays since a young age, like 3 and when i was 15 was when I found out that they are special days , and so when birthdays do happen I may come across as blunt? Or dont make a massive deal out of it for them sometimes, and they take all of that as I am being blunt and they seem to move away from me and dont make plans with me, same as when my brother was shot, I was a mess, initially they were there for me but eventually they drifted off. 

But as always we came back together and were just like old times, 
I know and they know Im a person who likes to deal with things on my own, but I just feel like a burden in their perfect world. 

I feel like their parents dont like me because of my family history and the way I grew up, I just dont want to always feel like a burden on my friends.
