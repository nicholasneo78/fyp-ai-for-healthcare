 My son's name is Tiger and he has Autism. He is almost 6. He is brilliant, beautiful, sweet, and yet no one out in the world sees that. They see a kid who can't talk, and who squeals alot, especially if he is upset. He has a lot of communication problems, but he has progressed so far since we found out he had a problem to begin with.  There are alot of people who have children with Autism in Plano,TX. I haven't really met anyone who has one like mine. Maybe I am not looking hard enough. I have a 14 yr old step daughter, a 12 yr old daughter, an 8 year old son, Tiger, and a 4 yr old girl. My husband works night. I stay home alot. Its hard to get out and work. Next year when my 4 yr old is in school I may be able to work.   I have always had trouble getting out and meeting people. I am a real homebody and I think my kids hate that. Its very very hard to go out when its just me and the kids. Tiger is loud and strong and loves to run away from me. I love my son to death but some people's reactions to him are hard for me to deal with. Outings with him leave me feeling frustrated that we can't seem to do "normal" family activities.
