 So what if I couldn’t drive??! It’s not like it is a crime to not to know how to drive? I mean, it’s not like I am troubling anyone by asking them to give me a lift, right?? Right??!! Well, ok.. maybe in some cases when I go partying with my friends… but then again, they offer to pick me up.. I didn’t force them, did I? Did I?? Malaysia has lots of public transports to choose from.. so, why the worries??   Consider this…    Men prefer their women to be more independent. You are independent if you know how to drive. I do not know how to drive.    Can someone tell me where’s the validity to the above statement?? Can anyone see the logic?? I don't think so.. but even if there's a yes among you people who read this.. I'll say, "Screw the men!" It's not my problem if they couldn't accept the fact that I can't drive!
