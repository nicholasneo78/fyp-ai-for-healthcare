 Well, yesterday I went to warped tour with my gay and lesbian friends from Kiel. I have to say that it was a rocking time. I got to see Story of the Year, which blew my fucking ass away. The pure energy that just flowed off of the stage and into every soul jamming at the concert was so intense. I really didn't expect much from the other bands that I saw, basically because I knew nothing of their musical endeavors. But I would have to say that Flogging Molly and Billy Talent really left a good impression on me. So good in fact that I decieded to download their music. Illegaly of course. It was the only way I could really show my appreciation towards them. Other than not being able to hear for most of the day, it went by pretty typical. Went to the farm for a while in the morning, came home, played a little Metroid on the JNES, and reffed a meaningless soccer game. Oh, and I created this incredibly awesome web blog. Yea, that's it. Until we meat again, Bacon out.
