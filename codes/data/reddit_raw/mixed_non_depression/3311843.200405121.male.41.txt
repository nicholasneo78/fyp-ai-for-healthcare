 I went over to my brother's yesterday evening to give him a demo of Knoppix. It was a CD which I got with my Dutch magazine PC-Active. The version is 3.3 His impression before putting the CD in was that Linux was overall much to difficult to learn, after all, he'd been using Windows since he has a PC - which is a fair few years now. When the KDE desktop appeared with working sound his face simply lit up. He didn't have to say anything, I could hear him think "wow!". We had a look through the main menu-structure and just ran a few programs - Mozilla, KMail, KStars, the Control Centre. He was simply impressed. I have to say, even from the CD, Knoppix is fast and reliable. He's now going to play around with the CD for a while and will probably get more enthousiastic as time goes by. In a couple of weeks (days?), I expect a request to make him a permament install on his hard-drive. He had just had a lot of virus-related problems and his windows-box had grind to a halt a couple of days ago. He was very interested in learning that with this operating system, no more of that would happen. He was also worried he wouldn't be able to do the things in Linux he did under Windows, but after showing him OpenOffice.org, this was no longer an issue.  Oh, by the way, there is a new version of Knoppix, 3.4 - read all about it on the  urlLink Knoppix website
