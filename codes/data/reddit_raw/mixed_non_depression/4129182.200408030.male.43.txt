 Ok, I'm a little nervous as this is my first blog post ever! Please bear with me! The purpose of this blog is to allow me to vent my daily observations.To those who know me, these would not be the "Happy" positive things I see but the negative cynical things with hopefully a twist of dry humor mixed in. I am not Politically Correct, nor am I Racist. Just an honest opinionated asshole! Those who are offended by my remarks. The hell with you. Leave; this is MY forum! --Thanks
