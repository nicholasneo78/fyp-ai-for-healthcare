(New York) Who's in the wrong here?
I'm a little upset over a disagreement with one of my best friends that occurred in late August and has resulted in us not speaking or hanging out since. We're in college and we were out together at a party. We were talking to some random guys, and I left because I saw my ex and was talking to him. My friend texted me asking where I was and I told her I was talking to him. She told me to go to her and I said okay, and asked if he could come. Then she just said i'll just go home see you later. I was like, no don't leave alone I'll come with you without him. But she kept refusing my offer and ignored my calls when i tried to find her. When she got home she complained to my other friend that I ditched her and made her walk home alone, when I offered to go to her and tried to get to her before she left. Since then she said she was taking time for herself whatever that means and literally hasn't contacted me since. I have tried apologizing numerous times and being normal but she isn't really having any of it, and says she isn't mad at me. We haven't spoken in around 2 months now and I'm really upset because I didn't feel like I did anything wrong for one of my best friends to hold some sort of weird grudge and I miss her. Did I fuck up?
