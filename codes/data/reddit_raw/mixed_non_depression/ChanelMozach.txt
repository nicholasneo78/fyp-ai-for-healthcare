Judgemental Family!
I have such a judgemental family, they all speak about each other and criticise everything you do. I’m fed up with being controlled and having judgements made about me. I can’t leave as I just can’t afford a place of my own. They won’t listen when I try and rationalise. Even the smallest mistake is taken out of contexts! I really feel like my mental health is suffering.... I’m aware that not much advice can be given but I needed to vent. Anyone out there feel the same?
