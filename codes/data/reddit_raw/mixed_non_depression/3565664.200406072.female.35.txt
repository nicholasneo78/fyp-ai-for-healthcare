 The Meadow  These meadows I walk so fine and green Give my soul peace My mind is at ease I hear the river calling Tears flowing with my past I listen to them calling I am Home at last For so long I listened to the melody The calling The whispers They always haunted me I ease into some comfort As I stroll this grassy plain I take my final place Knowing the peace will surround me Will ease my troubles and pain I listen to your sorrow The tears you shed for me The asking of why this all happened But maybe in time you will see No more suffering or torment controls me I feel free and alert I am let go of what haunts me Please let go of your hurt Don’t shed a tear Don’t cry over me Don’t feel like you failed I am at peace now you see My love for you did not go It will always be there In memories we had In the things that we shared I go away now To ease my tangled mind You will forever be My only one kind
