 I'm getting so frustrated with my dad. He's making me so mad. I sat up last night till about 1:00 because I was so mad. Well, our house is for sale. I guess they still want to think that I'm moving too. My parents are trying to make me feel bad for breaking the "family" up. Family my a$$. Yesterday I went to my moms house and played some music. There were so many people there. we had about 5 or 6 guitar players, 3 or 4 bass players, and 2 or 3 drummers. We think we may have a band formed though. Me, a guy named Matt who plays guitar, his brother who will play either bass or guitar, and Dean who will play whichever intrument Matt's brother doesn't play. Dean is awesome. He went to Juliard for four years playing bass but if you give him a flute, he would probly know how to play it. It's early and I need to go to band practice soon so I better stop writting.
