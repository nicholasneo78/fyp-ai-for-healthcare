Should i bother what best friend think about me?
I feel like garbage, i have no friends. When im with others, i try to be interesting, and funny, never harm others or depress others with sad stuffs. I think with friends you can loose up and be yourself. But my BEST friend have something problem with me. I think he dont like who i am, how i behave.

Sometimes he notices something about me. What i should have said, or done...like a mother see how her children behave. There was time when he bashed me because i was silent, or because i asked a question about our mutual FRIEND. This weekend we would held a little surprise party to our friend but he said to me, behave and be nice. If i was wrong or bad.

Nobody ever told me if i said, done something wrong. Never. He every time say something. He is very sumbissive to others, always go after others. And if he dont like someone, he always talks behind his/her back to me. He has friends i dont. And i feel a sack of ... because of this. I starting to have enough about how he wants me to behave within FRIENDS and pushing this "you are bad" feeling to me. I think this is not friendship, he is not my friend. If you are friend with someone, you like him/her who the person is. If i cant be myself within friends, i cant be myself elsewhere.

Stepped back from this party, and said im sick. This weekend felt bad because of him. What should i do?
