 Thought I'd start off with a couple favorite poems of mine.   In This World - Love has no color - yet how deeply my body is stained by  yours.  The night has a thousand eyes, the day but one; yet the light of the bright world dies with the dying sun. The mind has a thousand eyes, and the heart but one; yet the light of a whole life dies when it's love is done.
