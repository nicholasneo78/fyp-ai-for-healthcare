 Oh my!   I haven't been back to post at all!  Have you been visiting my website?  It's prolly going to be moving soon as Atlantic Broadband has bought out Charter Communications.  Charter was my previous ISP.  I'm reworking the site, and making it pretty before it's time to upload it to Atlantic.  I've been busy knitting, crocheting, supporting my Fiance in all his endeavors, looking out for myself, keeping my children well-behaved and productive members of society, and feeding the cat now and then.  I'll try to be better at posting!  Hugs,  Carol
