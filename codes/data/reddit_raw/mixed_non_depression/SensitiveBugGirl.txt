Is this kind of family interaction normal?
Hi all, I hope you can help me out. Is what my dad said to me normal? 

Backstory: I'm 24f...married...have a toddler. I was texting my mom today about several things (husband can get ribs on sale at work for them, MIL invited me and my mom to a play, things my MIL said that irritated me...etc. She was on break at work). At the end, she mentioned my dad is home sick today. Maybe I should call him. So I call him and ask him jokinging why he's sick. He said he has the flu or a cold or something. He stayed home yesterday too. Then he mumbled something offhand about how mom wasn't going to tell me because I never ask them how they are. 

Do normal parents do/say stuff like that? Won't tell their kid that one if them are sick because they don't ask how they are? It makes me feel terrible but also manipulated. It's not like my mom has never given me the silent treatment because she thinks I don't call enough. 

The thing is...I HATE small talk. I never ask anyone how they are. It feels fake and wrong to me(maybe because I don't think most people actually care about me). They(anyone) can tell me if they don't feel good. I wouldn't wait til asked to tell my close family/friends if I don't feel well. I also have social anxiety and anxiety in general. These kinds of comments make me want to call them even less. I already feel judged every time I call my mom. And I still get anxious every time my dad calls...thinking he is calling to yell or something. I just CAN'T ask. It literally feel impossible. Like I physically can't get the words out. 

Comments? Anything to make feel better? I feel down and don't like myself. I don't have any friends to talk to about it either.
