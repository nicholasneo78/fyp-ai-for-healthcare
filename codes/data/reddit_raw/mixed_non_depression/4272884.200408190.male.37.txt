 Blog. Short for we B LOG ? Or just another stupid semi-acronym invented for the 21st C.? Supposedly, these 'blogs' are the new 'journalism' or the new 'voice of a generation'. Just like the printing press in 1450, the telephone circa 18something (Google Telephone History, you'll see), and cable TV in the early 70's.  Whatever.  I'm not sure if this thing will come to any valuable/relevant end, but I like to ramble in print, and being too lazy to keep a journal, this is perfect. Also, hopefully, this blog will allow me to argue with people. I love to argue, and if a good debate is presented, then I may take the bate.  I may just use this to post my drunken ramblings, but I may also use this blog for evil. There are folks out there that need to be taken down a notch.  Anyway, for tonight,  Peace.
