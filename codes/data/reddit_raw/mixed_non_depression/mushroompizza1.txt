My parents let me drink
For anyone wondering what happens to the kids whos parents let them drink at home because "they need to learn" or "better in front of me" this is basically what it did to me.

It made alcohol really lame. Drinking wine at dinner didn't make me glorify alcohol instead I viewed it as just something to drink with pasta. It was demystified to me and now I barely touch the stuff. 

If anything its turned me into a square.
