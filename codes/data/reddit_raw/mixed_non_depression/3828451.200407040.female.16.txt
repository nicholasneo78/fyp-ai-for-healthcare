 Well today is fourth of July and my family is doing nothing but sitting st home and watching movies and eating a huge meal that my mom cooks like every weekend (its the Italian in her). But I'm hoping that we get this block party going thats going to happend in a few weeks, well actually next month probably, but i really want this party to happend b/c I'm gonna be turning 16 soon and want to have a tight party lol!! Well my mom called radio stations to help us with the party and everything and hoping that goes well too. It would have been a lot cooler if i got my licenses on my b-day too, if only i had a car though, hehe. I would go on a small road trip with my friends and not come back untill 2 weeks later (yea right my parents would kill me). Anyway, hope that everyone has a tight Fourth Of July, peace out!
