 Sad! My friends told mi tat I had help a guy who was out to take advantage of gals, the guy is a classmate and a friend of mine althought I wasn't close to the gal but he wanted mi to put in good words for him as my friends had told the gal negitive comments about him. I helped him cos I felt that he was true to mi and was a worthy  friend  to help but that was only a point of view of mi of a guy so i'm not sure about others (mostly the gals), I also donnoe about his past about his relationships wif other galfriends so I did't made much comments about him on tat. Anyway i don't reaili care about others past as whats past has past and what's important is now and the future so i placed my trust on him .  From what I had heard I think tat the gal is not mutual enough to start a relationship...
