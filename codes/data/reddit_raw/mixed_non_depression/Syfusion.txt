Sister wants to live in Costa Rica
So I have some questions about this, my sister has a 2 year old and is getting no child support. She wants to sell her stuff and drive to Costa Rica to live there. If she tries this can we intervene in the interest of the child's safety/life to prevent it from happening? The scum bag dad has thus far evaded the child support services and offered to pay for the child's passport in exchange for no child support. What can we even do here?
