My mother died...Left me more the siblings
My mother died recently. She had a retirement account and life insurance. I have two siblings. The benefits are being paid and She left me much more then them. I received about 50-60% of her money. I feel guilty and I'm afraid my siblings will forever have animosity towards me and my mother. Both siblings left long ago. One out of state and one out of the country. I was the only one around for my mom for more then 15yrs. She got cancer three years ago along with other illnesses and suffered a great deal. I was the only one here to help. Her last year and a half was very tough and I was her full time caregiver. I gave up a everything. As a business owner I Lost most my clients, compiled a mountain of debt and now I am alone to care for her house ( I gave up my place) and pay the mortgage. One sibling says it's unfair that I got more then twice him. The conversation killed me because I think he is hurt by it and I feel guilty. My mom told them before she died that I got the lions share but he says he didn't think it was this much of a disparity. I don't know what to do or how I should feel. She always told me she had her reasons. Part of me thinks that fair isn't always equal and I want to tell him that. At the same time I don't want to feel entitled or like I deserve something more. I don't know what to do if anything. I don't feel like I should give them some of my inheritance. 

I guess I am looking for a little validation and a little advise. 

side note: I don't think insurance companies and retirement funds should reveal the total policy or amounts and beneficiaries payout percentage. This is what causes problems.
