 Well, I thought if Lloyd can do it, so can I.       Haha. Good gutiarist though.       I wouldn't get too excited about this...chances are I'll have given up on this by the end of the week. Well, a week is enough to discover the excitmentness of my life.      So...it's 11:16, I'm listening to  Ace of Spades  by  Mot√∂rhead . I also just learnt the bass to  Are you gonna be my girl?  by  Jet . I've made an executive desicion, and I like them. A bit.
