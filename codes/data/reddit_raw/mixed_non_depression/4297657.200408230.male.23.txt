 I just finished reading G.K. Chesterton's "The man who was Thursday" on sunday.  I think it is possibly among the more thought stirring books I have ever read, especially the following lines "When I saw him from the back, I was convinced he was a devil.  But when I saw his face, I knew he was a God."  It was one of the more powerful lines of the novel, and I won't tell you much more because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet.  I think the most amazing books I have ever read (outside of the Bible) have been mainly fiction ones, that touched my heart rather than the philosophical ones that expanded my mind.  It is quite surprising that these novels are so dear to me considering my own overly cerebral nature.  Ravenheart by David Gemmel, has probably done more for me than Ethics, by Aristotle.  What kind of books are the ones that have made you change your thinking?  Josh
