 I have a lot of friends! They are so crazy and cool to hang around. When I'm don't feel to right they make me feel right. Like my friend Chondera can have a bad attitude sometimes but, she cool. When she don't get her way she get mad, thats the only thing that get on my nerves. My sister is sort of like my friend we fight and everything, I always bet her up but, she never learns! Here is the name of some of my friends: Artez,Chondrea,dre,Ashley,chaney,anthony,chrishane,   anthony, dominick,dominique aka tony,!   But thats just some around my neighborhood! yes I know I'm loved!
