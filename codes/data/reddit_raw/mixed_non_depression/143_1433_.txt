My 17 year old daughter wants us to let her go to Cabo with her boyfriend and his family during the summer... I need opinions
Everything about it just screams "Hell no" in my brain... safety issues with traveling to Mexico as a whole, she is 17, I don't know his parents, they have only been dating for 6 months... she says I'm overreacting about the violence in Mexico and that she doesn't do drugs so there is nothing to worry about... he is a good kid but he is 2 years older and in college (they went to the same high school). It's bad enough that I don't like the age difference... (they look the same age and act like the same age, they just aren't the same age)

I did tell her she could go once she turns 18.

Am I really such a bad parent for saying no? Help!
