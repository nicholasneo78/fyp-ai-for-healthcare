 School sux, I saw Dennis today and he somehow had the nerve to tell me I still owe him money. Now what the fuck kind of shit is that?! I dunno that jes pisses me off he has no right to ask for any kind of compensation after that. He took the money out of me in physical pain as well as hospital bills and the pure fact that he could be owing me money a whole lot quicker with one call to the cops. Dennis sit back, realize how cool about this I've been and give me a motherfucking break. Im still paying goddamn court fees from before and I dont have a fucking job so just accept me being cool and what you did payment enough. Whatever s'bullshit. So neways on a different note...I was glad I got to talk to Sarah last night, I feel bad tho because I can't help but feel bad for being the person who came between her and Tina. Todays just a generally bad day and all I can hope for is for it to start going better....sometime....
