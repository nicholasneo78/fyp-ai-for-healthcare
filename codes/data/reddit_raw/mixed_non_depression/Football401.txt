My friend is a douchebag
I don’t know what to do about my friend. I guess you could say he is the “leader” of our friend group. Because of this, no one does anything when he pulls a dick move. Everyone seems to worship him. He never thinks anything is his fault, even when he can do the most fucked up thing. He has no respect for anyone, he’s extremely rude. I can’t trust the guy cause he’ll share your secrets to the whole group (including you) just to be funny. He’s a major hypocrite. He bullies my other friend. This guy has been pretty much my best friend for a very long time, and I don’t know what to do. He says I’m his best friend, and it seems like that when it’s only me with him, but when there are other people there, he just leaves me in the dust, even though he always complains about when his friends hang out with someone else (like I said he’s a hypocrite). He makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit sometimes. I want to stop being friends with this guy, but he’s friends with all of my other friends. I can’t even seem to get him out of my life if I even try (our parents are pretty good friends). I just don’t have no idea what to do. Any advice would be greatly apprecited. By the way I’m in high school.
