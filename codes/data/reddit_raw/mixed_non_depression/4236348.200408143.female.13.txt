 Today I found out that Bj the guy i've been obsessing over for like forever likes me back. YES! But also the other guy I like...I think LoVe brought over his girlfriend. We're really super good friends and now he has a girlfriend! WHY TRAVIS WHY!? But maybe I can just make my move on Bj and see what happens with that. I hope some thing good! He is soooooooooo hot. God Life is good. By the way. He slept at my house yesterday. Altho he was drunk! Today after he left...;-)...he stopped by like 6 times. Plus mi (i hope future) boi just bought a new car. Guess whos gonna need a ride...hint hint. Well tomorrow I make my move. WoW this is great...........I just wanna grab him and kiss him!!
