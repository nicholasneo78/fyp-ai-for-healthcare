Status in family tree
Using a throwaway for anonymity :)


I recently found out that I was 'related' to someone, but after asking for more details, I'm confused as to whether it is true or not. This person's mother is cousins with the woman married to my grandfather's brother. 

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I honestly don't know where else, any help would be appreciated!
