 This is my first post so bear with me.  I want to start by saying that I love life, I just think that sometimes people are delt a messed up hand.  Why can't some of us have some happiness sometime. I have a wonderful son that I thank GOD for everyday.  He is truely the light of my life.  When I found out that I was pregnant  I worried "what am I going to do with a kid?", now I wonder what I ever done without him.  If somthing ever happened to my son I would die. With that said I want to know why am I so sad?   I failed at being a wife. (I only got married because I was pregnant and thought it was the right thing to do. there was no love involved). I wonder if I ever will fall in love.  Who knows maybe one day.   I just hate the weeks that my son is at his dads becouse those weeks are very hard to get through, not that anyone cares anyway.
