 Anyway, I can't sit around raving about the government all day.  I had a driving lesson today. God - that guy's insane! He had me (on my second lesson, mind - and I've never driven before!) bombing around Constitution Hill at 50km/h! I almost had a heart attack. Luckily, 'though, I didn't, and I'm still here to type all of this to you. Yeah, well, I suppose that scaring the shit out of your students is one way to ensure that they don't drive like idiots when you let them out onto the road after they get their licences. I mean, my best mate had his P plates for two weeks before he had his first accident - and I don't mean a little scraping, either! I'm talking a major, hi from hospital, thank god you've still got your legs deal. He couldn't walk properly for ages.  Makes you think, 'though - when we are more likely to die violently and horrifically than any other age group, is the price we pay for a tank of petrol really that important?  Thought for the day: Did they call Bali an act of God?
