Should I cut her loose?
 Hi everybody! First time posting over here, so let's go. What would you think of a friend who discusses everything with other friends? For example, if I do something that irritates My friend she tells her other friends about this instead of taking it up with me. Recently we had a fight and I know she has been telling some of our mutual friends about it. I firmly believe that if two persons have a problem they should talk it out between them without having to involve other people. This way of acting is only driving me further away from her. I'm here today asking : am I being childish for thinking this way. Thank you strangers of the internet!
