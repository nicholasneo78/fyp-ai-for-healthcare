Friend emotionally unloads on me?
I have a particular friend from highschool who always wants to meet up with me. We were good friends then purely due to convenience I feel, and over time we’ve become really different people. She had a bout of depression and has been struggling with these issues for several years now. 

I don’t feel like she’s responded to my own issues well, and for some reason her method of reassuring me is to “move on, and get over it”. I’m not quite sure how I feel about that considering I would never say that to her. It’s gotten to the point where she would occasionally send me messages on Facebook about her ill mental health and says that I am the only one she can talk to about this, despite having a boyfriend and other friends already. 

I want to cut her off, but at the same time for some reason I feel guilty to? Like here’s an emotionally vulnerable person and I’m not sure if I’m just adding to her despair. But I dread seeing her messages and I get tired thinking about her. I’ve also suggested professional help but she’s shot that down many times. 

Am I thinking too much into this? Thoughts?
