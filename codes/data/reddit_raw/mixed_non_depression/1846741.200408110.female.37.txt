 Everything seems to be getting worse.  Not only did I get a call last night from the lady who handles one of my credit card accounts, I got a call this morning from my mortgage company.  I don't have the money for this month's payment and the payment I arranged last month to cover the July payment didn't clear.   I have a number for a lawyer to help with getting everything put in my name.  I need to talk to my boss.  They've let me know that they might - maybe- willing to help me out with everything.  Why do I let this happen?  I know what's coming, so why do I let it happen?  I hate this.  I'm intelligent, mature, responsible.  Why do I do this?
