 Hello Bloggers and Bloggetts. Being this is my first post, a little background is in order. I am a 37 yr. old male with a penchant for technology, or as my wife likes to call me - I am a techno-geek. I am currently working for a LARGE technology company. I specialize in WINS and active directory, which are the Microsoft services for respectively finding and managing objects in a domain. Yes - I am plugging what I do in hopes of finding something interesting later on. Right now we are merging two networks and it has proven to be a challenge.  Also, I have been working on the website for my wife's business: http://www.oneclickawayphoto.com/.  TTFN. I'll post more later.
