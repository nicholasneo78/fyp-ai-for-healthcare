 13 more days until my vacation, not like I'll be going anywhere but It'll be nice to have the two weeks off. I'm downloading the beta for the new Warhammer 40k game, should be interesting, last time I beta tested a game it was Everquest for the PS2, I didn't like it, it was my first experience with a MMORPG and it really do anything for me. I do enjoy FFXI, but I think it's in part due to the fact it's based on a series I already know and enjoy. I remember a few years ago Bandai said the they were going to release a Gundam MMO, when I heard that I quickly and promptly  urlLink pissed  myself. Honestly the only thing I would have enjoyed more would've been a Macross MMO, unfortunately Bandai canned it, should have know it was too good to be true. Well talk to ya later.
