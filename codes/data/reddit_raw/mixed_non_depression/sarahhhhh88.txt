HELP! my friend invited herself along to a romantic holiday i was in the process of planning with my boyfriend.
I (19, F) flat with my boyfriend (19, M) and best friend (19, F).  Yesterday i bought up that me and my boyfriend were wanting to go to Aus at the end of the year in the summer as a treat. my friend jumped at this and was saying how much she'd love to go to aus as well, and how great it would be if we all went together. i have to admit i was kind of encouraging her, and talking about what we would do and how much fun it would be etc. but now she's looking at flights and hotels and asking me so many questions about it when actually i want this trip to be a thing that me and my boyfriend do, as a romantic holiday. i love my friend and it would be a lot of fun with her there but i also want this to be special and intimate with my boyfriend. we want to do our own things together. i feel so bad about this i don't want to end up ditching her or for her to feel like she's not wanted. how do i tell her this??? how do i make it clear that this isn't a friend group holiday, this is a romantic holiday for me and my bf. Tbh i wouldn't mind her coming to aus with us on the same flight and doing stuff with her there/meeting up with her to do fun stuff there....but she wants to book a hotel &amp; everything for all of us. HELP lol
