I am just confused what I should do or how I should act.(17M Asian)(Parent issues)
My dad a man I dearly respect for his achievements and the hard work he does for my family, treats me like shit in comparison to my twin brother. Often seeing my dad trying to be cheerful when talking to my brother and transitioning to his normal angry and grumpy self towards me, I can't help to be jealous. In terms of general achievements my brother and I are leveled equally but my brother is self centered and like an ass hole to my dad. Remembering a event few days ago, my dad asked him to come to a restaurant with the family but refused to go, reasoning that he didn't believe in family ties and emotions, only to be found playing with his online buddies when walking in(this happens  most week). Even then my dad tried his best to be cheerful towards him after dinner while I just got his tired grumpy looks. I am honestly thinking of just being a huge dick to my dad now and appeasing the retarded filial piety in my family. Any thoughts?
