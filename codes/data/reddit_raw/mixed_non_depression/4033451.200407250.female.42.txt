 Well...I could start this with "who I am" and "why I am here", blah, blah, blah.  But I will save that for another day.  I am an online diary/blog veteren so to speak.  I am starting a new one because too many people know me at the other one (I really think that in my cyber-saturated mind. How could they know me?  We've never met.)  Dammit I am going to be honest in this one, no playing for the audience.  I will warn you that I tend the blah, blah on about the negative.  So don't leave me posts about my damn negativity.  This is my house and my toys, go home if you don't like it.  And I am just going to start in the middle here so it probably will leave you saying HUH??             So Dan gets the car loan with grandma as the co-signer.  Then like 2 seconds later he decides to quit his job and move to Detroit and go to school.  Not a popular thing to do, and I agree.  He does have a new job lined up.  But him moving away and such gets grandma pretty nervous.  Fast forward to today....Sissy...I mean Mark (professional mamas boy) wants to come over and hang out with Brian.  I get home from work and he is already here...fabulous.  He's in the house maybe 15 minutes and he starts sticking his sissy boy nose into the Dan/Grandma/Car/Detroit business.  NONE OF HIS BUSINESS.  After a short time of this blah, blah I leave to room.  I want to keep myself from choking my brother in law....  "Well my thing is....." he says.  MY THING?  You don't have a thing...this isn't your thing.  Brian comes looking for me a little later after he got rid of Sissy.  He new exactly why I left the room (that why we are married 8-)).  He told sissy in no uncertain terms that if he came over to spy for his mother he might as well go home.   In fact (don't know what  happened to the freaking font), he told him they had better drop it before he said something he would regret later and told him (Sissy) that he (Brian) can handle Dan and life at our house without his advice.  GO BRIAN!        So thats today.      Hope I get back here....hope I can find it.             peace
