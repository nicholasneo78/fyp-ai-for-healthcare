Kids- I don’t want them...is it likely I will change my mind in the future
Hey all! I have felt very strongly that I don’t want children for many years now. I don’t think there is anything wrong with me not wanting kids. And I don’t think there is anything wrong with people that do want kids. I’ve been wondering how likely it is that I might want kids in the future. 

Has anyone not wanted kids when they were in their early twenties and then had a change of mind/heart? Just curious! Btw I’m 25 years old.
