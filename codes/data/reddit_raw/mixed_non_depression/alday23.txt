I just found my half sister &amp; half brother &amp; I'm super excited &amp; a bit down at the same time
I've known for many years about them, in fact my father (whom is their father as well, different mothers) was the one that told me I had a little sister, this was when I was around 10 yrs old or so. Since then I've chosen to put them in the back of my mind. My gf had asked me if I would ever look them up or would want to meet them, I just blahhed the question. So this past Sunday morning I typed in my last name on Facebook &amp; started snooping around. Voila, there was my half brother, voila, there was my half sister. No lie, I was extremely happy, &amp; extremely sad. My father had, has, is unfaithful to my mother. Because of that reason I had no interest in meeting my half family. Now I've run into my sister, she's 24 yrs old, super smart &amp; beautiful. I messaged her, we went back &amp; forth answering each other's questions. Now we are planning on meeting for the first time before she moves away across the country. It is a very God blessed situation that I am in. I always prayed to God that I would get a sister, (I am the eldest of three from both my dad &amp; mom, all three brothers) &amp; now God said, BAM, here you go. My sister seems like she is excited as well, I hope she is. Has anyone gone through something similar, have a similar life experience ?
