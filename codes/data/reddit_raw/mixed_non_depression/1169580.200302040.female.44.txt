 Ok, so this is my new blog. Hmmm. I think this looks better over here don't you? Yes, that's nicer. Ok then.   I'd like you to go and visit my website which resides at:  urlLink Bunni's Place    It's not quite finished, because my significant other hasn't finished providing me with his significant content for his part of the site. But the rest is done, or at least done enough that it might be considered enjoyable rather than annoying. Then again some people are annoyed by almost everything enjoyable. One can't make everyone happy.   I decided that a Blog might be a nice addition as I need a place to whine without having to upload a new whiners page to my site. Not that I will always whine here, but since I have the opportunity, I suppose I could. I could also leave the page absolutely blank, and make people wonder what I was up to. Well maybe just my paranoid visitors. Most people probably wouldn't care.   There's that word probably. Chances are, you will not see that word typed on a page of mine often. Since my earliest bbs days I have cut that word down to prolly, and it's become part of my speech. I avoid saying LOL during a conversation however. I actually do laugh out loud.   Well enough of this banter, because there's prolly gonna be more to follow.   I'd love to know how you like the website, and I'd be pleased to share comments and criticism right here in an open forum if you'd like.   Thanks for reading!   bunni
