 i have never experienced a death in my immediate family, and so that is what i fear most. my grandma's ill...yes, she was diagnosed w/ cancer yesterday. i feel so lifeless. already i have given up, lost hope, and her battle hasn't even begun. so as i laid in bed last night i prayed for my grandma's well being. i tried to convince myself that i wasn't praying for selfish reasons, but really i was. i needed her, to be there for me...to watch me walk down the aisle, to hold my first born and see them grow up. i've been walking through clouds since i found out. not a care for the world, not a care for myself...
