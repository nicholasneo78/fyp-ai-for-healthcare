Family arguments
So, for most of my life, I've gotten into private arguments with my dad that range from little spats to shouting matches (ranging from things like 'I'm not changing into something else' to 'You're wasting your potential'). He's a 50+ Catholic Indian (the country; and yes, they exist) who's lived in Chicago since he was 20. I'm a 20 something millennial born and raised in the States. But that's all fine; we have our arguments, but at the end of the day we love each other.

Lately, though, my little sister (in high school) has been getting into her own arguments with our dad. And honestly, I'm kind of glad that she's on the chopping block now.

Does that make me a shitty person?
