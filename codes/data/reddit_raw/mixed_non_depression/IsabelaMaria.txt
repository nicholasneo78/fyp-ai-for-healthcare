How to Make Friends When No One Likes You
A little background, in 4th grade my teacher would encourage bullying me (she got fired the end of the year) and I pretty much grew up taught it was okay to be bullied, so I never learned to stand for myself. That obviously left a lot of scars, and my depression (diagnosed in 7th grade) makes me isolate myself a lot. 

I don't want to sound like I'm looking for sympathy, and sorry if I am. 

But now I have mere months left in the school year of my senior year and I still have absolutely no friends. I am friendly and I try to be as outgoing as I can, it feels like everyone is keeping me at an arm's distance though. 

Is it me? It must be, I don't know why but something about me just makes others hate me. I'll ask how someone's day is going and often the reply is just a short "pretty good" and then that's it. I refuse to beg for friendship or to force anyone to talk to me so when they walk away or leave I'll just accept it, wave and say "see ya around" or etc. 

How do I get people to be my friend though? I don't smell, I am ugly but I try to cover that up best I can with makeup. I just want to feel like I belong somewhere with someone.
