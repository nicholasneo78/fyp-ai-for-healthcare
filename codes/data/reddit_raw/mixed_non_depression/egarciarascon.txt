Songs for children :)
Hello!

I recently launched a YouTube channel with fun videos for children and I'd like some feedback on the content, and I thought it would be a good idea to get feedback from parents or big sisters/brothers, etc. And if you also have suggestions as to what kind of content would be fun and educational for children I'd love to hear them. 

I am writing these songs so I basically decide what the story and the animation will be about.

Thank you,
Eduardo
