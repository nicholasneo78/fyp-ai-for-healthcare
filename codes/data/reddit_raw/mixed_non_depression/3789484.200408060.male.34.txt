 Oh, how I love being sick...especially when it means missing work. This week, for instance...I come down with something earlier in the week, end up missing two days at work, and things just fall apart while I'm gone. This results in me having to play "catch-up" for at least the next week.  This isn't the first time this has happened, either. Not two months ago the same thing happened, and on top of everything else, I still had to go in to fix a problem that no-one else at work could.  On one hand, it's nice to be needed. On the other hand, I could REALLY use an assistant!  Oh, what do I do? I'm the lone LAN administrator/IS technician at my workplace.  Knightsabre
