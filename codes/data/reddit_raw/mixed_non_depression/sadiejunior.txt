feeling betrayed
My best friend and I are dating two guys who are also best friends and roommates. At first we all got along great and had a lot of fun. Out of nowhere my best friends boyfriend started voicing how he really felt about me. He told her and my boyfriend (his best friend) that he hates me and can’t stand to be around me. He even said “seeing her is the worst part of my day.” This is only one of many many rude and uncalled for things he has said about me. He acts as though I am a nuisance when I have never done anything to him. My boyfriend and I can’t even be around them anymore because of how bad it’s gotten. It hurts that my friend allows this to happen and wants to be with someone who acts like this. It’s weighing heavily on me.
