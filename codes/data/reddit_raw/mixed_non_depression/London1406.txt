Worried about my daughter
I am in such a shit situation I don't know what to do. Myself and ex partner both have a child who is nearly 8 years old. We have been separated for a number of years and i see my daughter at weekends. The mother of my daughter isn't a bad person, she had a lot of bad stuff to deal with when she was younger. She basically smokes weed to shut out all the bad stuff and usually only does this when our daughter is in bed. A lot of the time she has threatened to kill herself and this has happened in front of my daughter I'm sure  which is so wrong. Today when I went round she started getting angry and I heard my daughter say to her 'if you don't stop I will run in front of a car when I'm older'. This has broke my heart completely and I don't know what to do. I hope my daughter doesn't mean this and is just copying her mum, but this is only gonna get worse as she gets older. Just to be clear her mum is a good person she just has issues and goes off the rails sometimes but I know for sure she loves her so much. I was just looking for advice on what I can do to make this better. 

Thanks
