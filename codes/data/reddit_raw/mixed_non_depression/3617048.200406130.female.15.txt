 Yesterday I went to my Grandpa's wedding! (Yes, my "Grandpa.") It was at a super fancy country club called "Glen Acres" and it was beautiful! I was all dressed up and wore make-up and heels!I (looked great.) It was a good thing we brought our digital camera too! I got to see many of my relatives that I haden't seen in years. Especially my favorite cousin Brent! We practically grew up together. You should have seen the ladies lounge! It was carpeted and had couches and bathrooms and even showers! My little brother told me that in the mens lounge they had a pool table! I had an amazing time, and I got to meet a lot of new people. I even cought the bouquet of flowers that the bride throws. But I doubt I'll be the next to get married since I'm only just turning 15 in 10 days! I had so much fun that I didn't wan't to leave. I'm going to remember that day forever!
