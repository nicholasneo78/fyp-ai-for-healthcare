Fight! Fight! Fight!
Hey Reddit community, I need to know if I’m in the wrong in a certain situation...

So a friend and I, lets just call him Kevin, have been good friends for years and have always gotten along (for the most part) pretty well. Earlier this week, though, he was poking fun at me about a certain rumor he had heard about me from a mutual friend of both of ours. The rumor was completely false and out of left field, so much out of left field, that I confronted the mutual friend and asked them what the fuck they were doing. Now, this mutual friend had told my friend Kevin about this rumor and they laughed about it and he made fun of me for it in a pretty brutal, but still jokingly, manner, but decided to drag me in front of the whole squad about it before he asked me whether it was actually true or not. It still bugged me, though, that this mutual friend was talkin shit to who knows who else, spreading this false rumor and whatnot, so I decided to control this mutual friend about the rumor. The mutual friend was surprised that I confronted them about it, and complained to Kevin and thought that it was “weird” that I would confront someone who was spreading false shit about me. Now apparently this mutual friend cut ties with me (I think it’s funny and I wasn’t good enough friends with them to actually care), but Kevin is extremely angry at me and we haven’t talked to each other or about it since, making me think that things will naturally go south. I admit I may have overreacted although I don’t think I’m in the wrong, so I refuse to apologize. Any advice, Reddit community? If I believe that I truly wasn’t in the wrong, should I really apologize for how I handled this?
