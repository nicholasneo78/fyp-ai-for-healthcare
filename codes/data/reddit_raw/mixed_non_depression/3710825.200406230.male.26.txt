 Some times a person is so confused that he doesnot know what is he doing here in this world..he just lives the moment and doesnot plan anything....I do a lot of such stupid things in my life... and that make life so much packed that some times i feel that i do not have time for myself..why am i living like a fool and again i do not have time to sort this out....        I remember when i was in school I had the best of the friends one can have and there used to be a great joy or some good feeling when we used to sit together in the play time and during lunch time etc etc.... then as I grew i still have friends but its kind of different probably i need to feel good for all my real professional friends but i kind of like the people who consider me their yar and take me for granted....any way i can change myself thus i too am bit professional( i donot know if this word suits here) when it comes to friendship...keep it simple....But then you miss that kind of a friend who is really reliable and the one who you can go anytime when you have a problem... but then i guess its time to live yourself that's to solve your own problems and have a peacefull life....
