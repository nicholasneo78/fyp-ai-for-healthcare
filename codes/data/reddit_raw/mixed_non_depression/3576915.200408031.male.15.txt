 Hey all.  Just felt that i needed a change, so i have deleted all previous posts. they were boring, anyway.  My grandmother is in the hospital again. she's been puking and having dizzy spells, and the doctors don't know exactly what's wrong with her. so much for modern technology.  Read the  Da Vinci Code  by Dan Brown. interesting book. it argues that Jesus was not divine, and that the church invented his divinity. Also argues that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene. well i'm not going to go in depth to argue anything, but i think Dan Brown made lots of mistakes in his assumptions. for example, he writes that Peter was the one in the picture " The Last Supper " who was making threatening gestures. apparently that man is Judas Iscariot, not Simon Peter. that explains a lot about the hand gestures.  Anyways, there's a reason why the book is under the fiction section in book shops and libraries.  Thinking of getting a new cpu.  Thinking of you, too.  Bye all.
