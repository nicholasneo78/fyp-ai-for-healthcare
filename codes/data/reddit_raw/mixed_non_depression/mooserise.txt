should i be upset with my best friend?
My best friend of over 10 years recently took her first trip to New York City. I was so excited for her, and she had asked about what my favorite things to do when I was there were. I knew that she would love the view from the empire state building and decided to buy her a ticket up as a christmas gift. When I gave her the gift, she was really excited but as her trip has come and gone it is apparent that she didn't go despite texting me multiple times on the trip saying how excited she was and mentioning vague plans for when she might go up. I know she arrived with little to no real plans for the entire week and spent a lot of time wandering, which is why I feel that letting the gift go to waste is kind of disrespectful. I also feel that if she were upfront and let me know that she didn't go would be much better than trying to ignore that it happened. I want to know what other people's thoughts on this are before I talk to her, and also maybe how to approach her about it because this is something that is uncharacteristic of her and kind of hurtful to me.
