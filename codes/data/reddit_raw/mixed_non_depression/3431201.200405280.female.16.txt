He is the only one i will ever love EVER!!!!And another funny thing the guy that my sister is in love with David Gardner is the kid that i grew up wit and i think its pathetic that she is dating him cuz hes mean ugly and dumb......nah ....he knows im jus playin at least about the dumb part....lol! You know i love you chelle!  ~N* *~E*~ ~*~Wayz*~*      Yesterday was our last day of school and it was really great people was out in the parking lot bombin people wit water baloons i got hit by one or at least the water. It was fun tho. Then i went to muh babys house and we hung out and stuff. Then he had to bring me home and that part of the night sucked but o-well i will see him again on saturday so its all good.
