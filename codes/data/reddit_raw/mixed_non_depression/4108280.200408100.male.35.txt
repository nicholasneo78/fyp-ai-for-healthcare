 As I journey through this world of Blogging, I can’t help notice these scripts called quizzes. When I was teaching, one of the activities that most students hate is quizzes. But now, as I browse the blogs of some of my students, a large number of them post quizzes on their sites. I inquired as to why they like these quizzes and most of them replied that these quizzes is sort of personal and delivers a result that they find amusing.  As I delved into this, I can’t help but ask myself, can I apply this approach to my students in school? If possible, how?  Here's a samples of what quizzes are available to be used in ones blog:        Your love is... by  urlLink  ChibiMarronchan        Your name is...
