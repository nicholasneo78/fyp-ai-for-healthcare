 I came to work today, checked my e-mail and there sitting in my inbox was an e-mail.  An e-mail from someone I went to High School with.  Someone I haven't spoken to in about 8 years.  I got that kind of panicky feeling before opening it. I always expect the worst.  Was she going to tell me about some unexpected tragedy that had befallen her or a mutual friend or even worse relate how wonderful her life has been since graduating.  Of course, it was the latter.  She's married, has a house, baby on the way, and has a great job.  Oh my Gawd, I can't breathe....  How can I compete with that? I'm still figuring out what to do with my life and right now I'm not even close.  I have a boyfriend and we've been together almost 4 years but we have no definite plans of getting married. And kids?  That isn't even a thought.  We are in escrow now for a house but every day feels like we are periously close to losing it due to my bad credit.   Since I was born every step of the way has be measured out.  1.  Graduate High School.  Okay, Check. 2. Graduate College. Mmmm, Check. 3. Get a job. Alright, Check. Alright, now what?  I did all that sooo..... I'm waiting........... what's the next step?   MarriageHouseChildDivorceRetirementDeath.   Great can't wait.
