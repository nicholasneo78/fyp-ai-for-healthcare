I think my friends ditched me.
I was recently doing a mass unfollowing on Instagram and I noticed a lot of people that I went to high school and college with are no longer following me. Same thing with Facebook. I don’t blame them because I’m boring and they are either married with kids or they’re just out to the hottest bar or club every damn weekend. I don’t drink nor am I in a relationship or married. Where does a 29 year old go to make new friends and even find the love of their life? I failed to find her in school or work. Am I just doomed to roam the planet a loner who only can have internet friends. Sure it’s cool at first but I need real friends to talk to and someone to marry for real. (Disclaimer I do talk about romance a little here but at this point I’m mostly looking for new friends since it seems everyone I ever knew have left me behind. Please don’t delete!)
