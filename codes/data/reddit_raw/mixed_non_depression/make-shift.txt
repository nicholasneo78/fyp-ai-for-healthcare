New friend always drags along insufferable friend.
I've recently become chummy with a guy who I get along with swimmingly. Conversation is easy and stimulating, and we've reached the point in our friendship that we can talk about some really deep and personal stuff. 

Even more recently, however, he has gotten in the habit of inviting along another friend, Tony, to our friend dates. I'm not such a fan of Tony. He is negative and annoying, and genuinely makes the time we spend together unpleasant. 

How do I tell my friend that I don't want to hang out with Tony without coming across as a dick? Is there ever a point when I am candid about the reasons why?
