 Ive had this blog for a while and have been working on a new template, self-teaching myself cascading style sheets. Ive decided to keep this pre-designed template provided by blogger.com. I suppose its alright...quite professional looking. I applaud whoever makes these. But my new one will be the shit.   Anyway, I was having a good day today until 3rd period and I had english. We're supposed to be a democracy right? That is the whole point of our country, the American Dream. Well, why is school have such a FASCIST system? They tell us what we have to learn and force us to learn in no matter what. If we dont we are threatened with referrals for insubordination or possibly even suspended. What the fuck is this. I hate public school, alot of teachers just dont care about their students. I know if you're a public school kid you just cant possible fathom how much better a private school like Gilman is and I'm sorry if I offend you. I think Ill stop now...please feel free to leave comments. I'll read them.
