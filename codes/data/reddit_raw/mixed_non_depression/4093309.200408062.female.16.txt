 School starts in two days.  I just can't believe that.  It's like I've not even had a summer.  I'm excited because (1) I'm a junior and (2) I *liver sign* learning!  And Mrs. Bovender is simply awesome.  And as excited as I am I'm also not really looking forward to working myself to death.  But it's encouraging to think by the end of this year I'll know Calculus, and high-level chemistry, and be fluent in Latin, and know more about the history of the United States than I ever wanted to know, and be able to write an incredible essay in a short period of time....not to mention play a piano concerto. :)   Gah the PSAT is soon too.  I had this grand idea of me making like 2000 flashcards and learning all the words but I'm so tired right now.  I have to read my other book this weekend as well...which I haven't even started on.  Life is just too complicated sometimes...having to juggle schoolwork and music and social things.
