Need feedback: what do you do with your used toys?
Hello parents

I am working on a project that helps families sell or giveaway used toys through a simple app (free to use) and in the process build a responsible conscious generation of kids who love to share!!

The app is not yet working but I would love to get your feedback on the website and service and let me know if that's something you may use! would be great to provide feedback through the website itself but of course comments and discussions here are encouraged! I really appreciate
