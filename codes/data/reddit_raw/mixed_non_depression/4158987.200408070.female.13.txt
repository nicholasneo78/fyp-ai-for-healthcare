 I love that word. Ponderings. If you break it up you get pond, like lake, eh, like oh, ring like disaster. Because wedding rings do tend to end up in disaster. So pondering is like dipping into a lake of disaster. Mmmm. Maybe if I shut my eyes I'll be able to feel the waves washing over me, hear the delicate ripples as leaves fall into my pond and breathe in the air of immortality. If the Philosophers Stone is a soluble tablet, my lake of disaster is the solution for it. Like in chemistry. I dreamt the other night that I was in a cold, dark lake and that I was below, watching the world through a rippled mirror. I saw myself peering down and a white hand slooshing the water and slooshing my view. When it was finally clear again, all there was was a star that lit up the lake. And in the middle of the star, there was me, spread out in a crucifix shape with my eyes blazing and my hair fanning out like it does underwater. I reached out to feel the wetness on my hair, but I felt only heat as the star plunged into the icy water and I melted into oblivion. I love random dreams.
