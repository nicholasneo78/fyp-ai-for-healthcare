relationship with sister falling apart, different memories, need advice
Hi,

In a nutshell - my sister (both about 30years old) has been accusing me of saying various horrible/bad things, often saying I said it seconds ago, sometimes hours ago and getting angry with me.

I don't think I've been saying these things.

It's really wearing me down, either I am being horrible and forgetting, or she is (perhaps unknowingly) making it up.

I've recently said I'm going to record some of our conversations to see if I can prove my innocence, or find out I have an issue with my memory/attitude and get help.

This has gone down very badly, she now insists I don't speak to her for at least as long as I may record her.

What do I do? My goal is for my family to get along well, or at least OK - but I have no idea what I can do to fix things or make them better.

Any thoughts or advice is more than welcome

Fully aware this is my perspective, and I may have subjectivly squewed it - will try and answer any questions if asked
