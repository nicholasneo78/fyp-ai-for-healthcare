Not good enough.
Greetings, everyone. I am currently in need of venting my thoughts. Reddit seems like the perfect environment for fucked up people, like myself. I've come for the wisdom and maybe even the charming assholes. So, here's the scoop:

Growing up, I was always compared to a specific relative. I won't say which, because I'm a paranoid fucker. But we shared the same gender, were of similar ages, and were always very different from each other. Still, we were extremely close. The biggest difference was our weight. Yes, I was always the "larger" one. People enjoyed to point it out, but what really stung was that our own family would as well. Fast forward to years later, when we were in our teenage years. It became so much more than our weight. Our family started comparing our physical appearances. They were always the more "attractive" one. The more "successful" one. We are both adults now. Our grandmother speaks wonders of this person, and only has negative things to say about me. Despite all of this, I was always deemed the "nicer" one. That hasn't mattered a single bit. I constantly beat myself for picking up the phone when our grandmother calls, because I give her personal details of my life only for her to turn around and use it as juicy gossip material. She is very sick, and I assume quite close to death. I pick up because I feel massive guilt when I ignore her calls, while my ever-so-"better" relative ignores them with no problem, and is still worshipped. I've considered cutting ties with my entire family. I don't believe they genuinely care about me. Yeah, I'm struggling. Bad. I'm basically at rock bottom right now. Still, I highly doubt my wellbeing is in their best interest at all. I don't think I'll ever be the picture perfect grandchild, child, sibling, whatever. It drowns me deep in self-loathing every day.
