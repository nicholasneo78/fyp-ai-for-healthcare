 O  k, so you ever have those days where you just feel like shit? I am having a bad one today. My Grandmother is in the hospital dying and has been for the last few days. But because of my work I haven't been able to be there much. So, I went to work this morning and just felt horrible being there. It was actually making me ill. So, I left at lunch, and now I feel guilty about leaving. Oh well, I think a day will help me. I need some time to process things. And I will do a shift at the hospital tonight with my mom. I just really wish there was something I could do. I hate being helpless. Fuck, this sucks.
