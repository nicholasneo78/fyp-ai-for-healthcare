 Today I had so much fun.  I met a new guy, his name is Kenny.  I met him at my friends house where we were rehearsing are skit for the MDA fair.  Kenny is the magic mirror in the skit.  He is hilarious. Most of his part is him just making stuff up off the top of his head.  He is 18 and acts like a 15 year old.  Today he tackled me, it was so funny because I play insulted him and he jumped me. We called a truse after that but kept messing around.    most of my friends are guys.  I don't really know why but they are.  I just feel really comfortable around them.  When I am around girls all they do is gossip and talk about you behind your back.  But guys are not like that at all, except for the gay ones but I only have one gay friend.  The guys I hang out with are usually what people call geeks or nerds or whatever you want to call them.  Have you noticed that all the really nice guys are nerds or geeks?
