I need help with my best friend.
One of My best friends is starting to act like he hates me lately and I don't know why. Like a month or two ago he needed advice about this problem he had with a girl he liked and i gave him advice that helped really good but if I ask about it now he gets mad at me and says it none of my business. What do I do?
