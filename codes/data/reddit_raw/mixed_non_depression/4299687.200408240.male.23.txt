 During the last week of March 2004, two friends and I were on a road trip to New Orleans for spring break. The three of us fell for a police trap and were arrested in Stone County, Mississippi. My two friends were charged with misdemeanors for possession of marijuana and I was charged with a felony for possession of a controlled substance. I took the wrap for the six hits of acid we had in the car because the two of them had recently discovered they were going to have a baby. If I hadn't taken the blame, all three of us would have been charged with felonies and the two of them would be in much more trouble now than I am.  Flash forward to today...  I am 23 years old. I am a college graduate (Bachelors in Communication  ; Art). I am employed by my father (who spent $4,800 to bail me out of jail). I work as a detailer, graphic designer, and a networking technician. On the weekends I work for an entertainment company as a disc jockey. I have a $3,000 credit card debt, a $17,000 student loan debt, and a $4,800 debt to my parents. One day, within the next year or two, I will have to go to court for the felony. Right now, I barely make enough money to pay my bills and some how I have to save for lawyer fees. Any ideas grounded in reality on how to handle this situation?
