Lonely, family/friends just not interested??
We moved across the country almost a year ago. We left all our extended family behind, which was hard because we were really close to them. But, It was a great opportunity for us. We are doing really well as a family unit, with life, jobs, and everything other than missing our family.

Now, I'm getting really lonely, and can't seem to get any of my in laws or friends to come visit, even the ones with no jobs, kids, whatever. Tried offering to pay for the airfare. I set up a fully furnished guest room, and offered it up. I have kept in touch with everyone on a weekly or bi-weekly basis on the phone this whole time, as well as every couple of days on social media. 

We were all so close before, but since we moved, it feels like everyone just wants to forget we existed. Is it time to just stop trying?
