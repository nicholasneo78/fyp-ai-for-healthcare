 Yup, today was just 'one of those days'.  Everyone has them, they are inevitable, along with many other things in life.  I woke up late, and isn't it funny, it seems that most days when u start them off bad by sleeping in when you shouldn't, they just go downhill from there.  It's true, observe your day next time you wake up late...  but it wasn't the small annoyances that made my day 'one of those days'... these small things such as being late for work, the kids being off, tripping over EVERYTHING, breaking my cell phone (on one of the trips ), and losing my keys just made the bigger things in my life... much BIGGER today... As I look on my life right now, it seems like utter chaos, and I don't like it.  I am trying to be strong, but lately I just don't know.  How do you gracefully walk away from someone you love no matter how right you KNOW it is, especially when you are sending them straight into the arms of someone else?? Between this, and many other things going on, I , for the first time in my life, feel completely lost.  And I spend a lot of time trying not to feel sorry for myself, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  I don't know how people can deal with so much WORSE, and it happens. Daily and in tragic ways.  So,this pattern of thinking does put things in perspective b/c my life isn't exactly tragic, but my sentimental side tends to still succeed in getting in the way.  Anyway let's just say that after today, I hope I wake up one time tomorrow, so it's not another "one of those days" :)
