 ANGEL        I don’t think much about it anymore, but there was a time I couldn’t get it out of my head.     It was a day I didn’t think I would survive, the metropolis of intuition that was vacuumed in my mind was endless.  I wanted to get it out and fast.  I hate myself when I am so inconsistent and incoherent.  I am in a state that cannot be reversed or understood.  I can’t remedy it.     Sex was never as good with her as it was in my mind.     There is nothing like cotton t-shirt sheets.     I feel creative but can’t understand why.  It’s been months since I have written.     The sunlight wakes me again, and I want to die.     I hear Massive Attack in my head…..the soft ambient noise in my mind that seems to always be there.  Angel, Angel, Angel.  I love that girls voice.
