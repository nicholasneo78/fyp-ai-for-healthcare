Calling all insecure but respectful dudes
This girl is the absolute love of my life. What normally would take a year or two of chemistry has happened in 5 months.. 
  I'm 24 years old, and I dont have much of a social life.. other than the few guys I work with. I've had a drink with my trainer, 9 months ago.
      My girlfriend on the other hand has such a lively social circle, that it has almost became an entire subject on its own. 
It pains us both to talk about it..
  Obviously working nights and having an irregular schedule makes me stressed or anxious as is. My lack of socializing with more than just one highschool friend.. It plays a huge role in how/why these arguments take place.
 I just want to be a more understanding boyfriend. 
Please, someone hear this out.
