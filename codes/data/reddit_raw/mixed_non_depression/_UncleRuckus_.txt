The Glory Hole, a fun group of friends on Discord welcoming new members!
**Who Are We?**  
We are The Glory Hole, a group of introverted nerds and loners from around the world with ages ranging from 16 to 35.  
While we aim to facilitate a fun and welcoming place for online strangers to meet and make friends, our core philosophy rests on the concept of free and open discussion. This means the staff takes a hands-off approach in regards to the opinions of the users and the language used. At the end of the day, The Glory Hole is all about hilarity and friendship, nevertheless, if you are easily offended, this probably isn’t the place for you.  
  
**What’s with the Theme?**  
Our server’s theme is a fun piece of window dressing that allows a colourful hierarchy of roles for users to work towards via their activity in the server. We may be a hole in the wall, but we are a classy one at that :p  
  
**General Life?**  
The server consists of text, media, and voice channels where users share their interests, pets, favourite videos, etc, and have discussions of all varieties. Most of the action happens in the voice channels however, where we have rooms for watching movies, listening to music, and playing video games in addition to large rooms for rowdy discussions and smaller rooms for more quiet conversations. Sometimes we’re all in a big room together, chilling out as we play video games, and other times we splinter off into separate rooms to partake in differing activities.  
Once a week however we host a planned movie event where users make suggestions, cast votes, and hold screenings of their favourite films. We would like to partake in more regular planned events as the server grows.  
  
**Bots!**  
Our main bot, Madam Luvaeux, incorporates a silly currency system so that you can gamble, purchase other users, and even buy colourful roles to lord over other users. Many other bots are also available that allow users to listen to music, play games, post memes, and other various time-wasting activities.  
  
**Should I Join?**  
We have a great group of friends already, but we are always open to welcome newcomers into our fold. A group of people like The Glory Hole is an amazing way to make new friends and to fill those lonely evenings up with lots of laughter and other voices. If you’re at all interested in joining our group or poking your head in to see what’s up, I welcome you to follow this link: https://discord.gg/H4w58Px
