Friendship jealously
I am very close with 3 girls and I’ve noticed if definitely the duff(desensitize ugly fat friend). Which I  guess is fine but it’s just that my two friends have boy friends and that all they talk about. There going to a volleyball game and didn’t even tell me (we literally tell each other everything). And I was like I’ll go with another girl and they didn’t even want me to go. Anyways they just have such perfect life’s school, popularly, money, And there  beautiful.  And like much more. And I’m over here with a horrible life compared to them my family sucks and like if I got into details you would understand I have no friends except them  my family is broke and I’m so ugly and I suck at school. I know thing will get better bc I’m only in 8th grade but it’s just so hard to be friends with these amazing girls when your constantly comparing yourself and lowering your self esteem. And not to mention snapchat is the worst when ever one of my friends is hanging out with another it instantly ruins my day. I honestly just want advice on how not to be so jealous and how to be more happy because Ik my life doesn’t suck and I’m not a 30 pound kid in Africa drinking dirty water.
