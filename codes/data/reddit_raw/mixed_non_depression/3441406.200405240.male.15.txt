 Hi pplz!  I just started this blog thing and I have to learn how to use it. Today is a school free day.  It is boring, but some friends are coming over and I have no idea why...I want to go swimming. Last weekend, I went to Callaway Gardens (which was boring), the mall (stayed the whole frikin day, my feet hurted a lot!), Asian Square (got a fan with calligraphy written on it), the movies (saw Troy), I made a Dir en Grey CD, washed my aunts car (got paid $10), and tasted a Latte from Dunkin Donuts for the first time, those damn lattes are strong! I wanted a Donut! But I was broke. Damn. Hope today will go fine...
