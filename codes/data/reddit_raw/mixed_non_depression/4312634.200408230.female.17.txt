 My day was horrible today.  Apart from the "drama" in "Shakespeare's theatre" my heart was tied in a knot.  After coming home my madre informed me that Orlando would not be coming home this weekend because he had something to do in Bristol.  I do understand that this is a new life both exciting and adventurous, but I also understand the pain I experienced when realizing I would not see him for another week.  I knew this wouldn't be easy, it just sucks.  There are beautiful, sophisticated girls there and I am some simpleton with which there lies no mystery or intrigue.  I am old, boring and worn out.   Also, I know that I am a bit too dramatic and am making this situation sound much worse than it is, but heck, this is a journal for me right?  I can say whatever the hell I want to!  I really want Orlando to follow his heart and if he wants to participate in anything he can go for it.  I want him to enjoy college, experience new things and have fun...I just miss him...that's all.  I love Orlando.
