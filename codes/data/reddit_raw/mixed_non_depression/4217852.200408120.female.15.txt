 I'm falling head over heels for you I'm not ashamed, just afraid of you I'm running away from love and from you I don't have anywhere to go but to you What do you want me to do I'm falling head over heels for you  I saw you sitting there with your friend I didn't know how to talk to you but then You looked over at me and you said hi There it goes, my heart just had to fly I acted cool, calm and collected I knew that I wouldnt be rejected You felt the same way about me And I knew that this could really be Something amazing and wonderful Looking around, I didnt see another girl I caught him, he is mine Leave me alone, I am just fine  I'm falling head over heels for you I'm not ashamed, just afraid of you I'm running away from love and from you I don't have anywhere to go but to you What do you want me to do I'm falling head over heels for you   I'll finish this song later!
