 Well I talked to Eric and he said he didn't tell Erin anything, but he does like me.  So that's good.  Although, he just wants to be 'single' for awhile.  Oh well.. we're still friends, and that's awesome!  I was just starting to come out of my head, but I thnik I'm gonna go back in for awhile....  ~Can't blame a girl for trying...
