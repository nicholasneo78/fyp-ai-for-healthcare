I've been sleeping with my best friends girlfriend for 3 years??
I'd be lying if I said I don't feel guilty. But on the other hand I still do it. We have been seeing each other behind his back for about 3 or more years every other day. She tells me everything about them. How sex with him is awful. Which I knew already because he asked me what he should do about it. I gave him good advice. I guess it didn't change anything. The sex with her is amazing. I think it's how taboo it is. We're all over each other. She lets me do things to her that She won't let my friend do on her , like anal I was the first one to ever do anal and throat fuck her and STILL do it. She wants a relationship with me and there's no way in hell that's going to happen. She thinks that I'm in love with her and that we will be together. She talks about us running far away together. All I have to do is say the word. I'm a big believer in "once a cheater, always a cheater". But she seems to be in love with me. My gut is telling me shes in love with me. My gut is never wrong. I guess I'm doing both of them wrong. I know he uses reddit so I'm not going to give all the details. I also want to add that I still respect the guy a whole lot. I would hate to lose his friendship. I know I should stop but the sex is just so addicting. She had sex with my brother too.
