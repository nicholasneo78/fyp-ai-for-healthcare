 I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to write about on here. So I am just going to write about what I am thinking. I'm leaving for college in 8 days. I'm pretty scared because I have a great boyfriend that I have been dating for almost a year and two months. He is going to college about two hours away from me. We are both playing basketball so I'm not sure if we will be able to see each other much during the season. I am majoring in biology but I'm not sure what type of career I want to have.     Well I have been looking around this site and I can't find out how to look at other blogs. I guess I'm "blog illiterate." It doesn't really matter to me though. I don't mind if nobody reads this. I like being able to write about my feelings. I kind of actually feel like a dork for doing this. Oh well. Nobody will know!
