Should I cut her off finally?
Been knowing bestie since we were 14 (now 30), we've been through a lot blah blah. In the past year or so, I've sensed she sort of feels envy or jealousy, not sure which. Things like being short in messages (HATE this), not reciprocating advice when I always do (I got accepted into university and she barely acknowledged, just like to hear support sometimes, and then proceeds to try to enroll sooner at same school and tells me, expecting congratulatory response of course, or even advice over guys), being overly aggressive and controlling when she drinks (have cut back going out A LOT due to this); so any who, I don't want to lose her but am at point in my life  where I don't want any negativity, she's been through a lot, and sometimes I feel she needs me more than I need her. I'm stuck but gearing towards letting her go, but just unsure, maybe I'm overreacting? :(
