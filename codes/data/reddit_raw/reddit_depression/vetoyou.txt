I need help finding help.
This is literally a cry out for help. I have no job, and I sleep on my sister's couch and I need help. I know I need therapy but have no way to afford it. I don't know where to look for it. I have no energy to pursue it. What do I Do? Where do I go? For information I live in Memphis, Tennessee. Any help at all would be great.
