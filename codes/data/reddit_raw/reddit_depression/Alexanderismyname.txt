My depression is so strong that I can’t even enjoy music!
Music has been my favorite pass time for a year or so. It really helps with my depression and anxiety. Sadly, I’m in such a deep depressive episode that I can’t enjoy it, it feels more like background music, I just can’t enjoy it.

I’m also anxious, I don’t really know why. I just started a new subreddit, it makes me anxious thinking about it. Maybe I should remove it. Oh well.

Thanks for reading
