Laughed today from an unexpected source
Particularly rough night Iâ€™ve been having alone with my thoughts. Decided to text one of these crisis hotlines for the first time ever... no one was around to reply for an hour. 

I found myself laughing pretty hard at the irony of not getting a response from a suicide crisis hotline. Go figure. 

But hey, crisis momentarily averted lol
