Had to talk about myself in a group setting today
We were all given the task of talking about our lives one at a time for two minutes

Before everyone started, I asked how negative shit could be

Everyone laughed

When my turn came I basically said:

I used to have hopes and dreams, gave up, wasted years getting fucked up, almost died a few times and now I'm trying to fix my life but it's a slow process and I regret 80% of my life

No one laughed then

Funny that
