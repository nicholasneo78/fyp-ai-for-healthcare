Can depression impede articulacy?
Obligatory I've been living with depression (BP2) and anxiety for much of my life as a young adult. It's been stronger than it ever has the past year and a half, and I've noticed many things about myself that aren't in line with who I thought I once was. One of the most significant is how I sound to myself and others. I used to actively attempt to expand my vocabulary as well as possess an ability to articulate my thoughts, but it seems these days, I'm just drawing blanks most of the time. I feel like an idiot and inferior to others.
