Went to a therapy centre for the first time today
I hesitated so much before going, I almost went back too many times. I actually got the address wrong the first time and knocked the door on a young lady asking her if she’s the therapist at the address that I have. Anyway, I’ve filled out the forms and I’m waiting to be contacted by the centre, it’s scary and weird.
