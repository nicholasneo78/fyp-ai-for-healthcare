Despair is the normal state of my life
I haven't drank though. I have no urge to drink. I just want to stop.

Stop moving. Just end. I keep picturing myself walking out on my job. Getting kicked out of my apartment. Living in my car. That being repossessed. And eventually ending up in a gutter, wrapped in a a blanket but still freezing to death. Just frozen. Not moving, not willing and thus not physically able to bring myself to it. There is no point to it.

It's never enough. Not matter how much you work, how hard you try, it doesn't work. I don't get ahead. Everything I am, someone is better at it. And anything I do, I can be replaced. And if I do find success by some small measure, I acclimate and find myself just as miserable. Nothing has changed. I did a long big post a few weeks ago about all the supposed progress I made. It doesn't bring me happiness anymore. I am so fucking far behind I will never get to a place where I feel safe, so fuck it. I just want to exit. I am sick of being a cog in a machine I never wanted to help built or run. Life is just work, sleep, and distract.

I am not sure why I am writing it. I don't know how I found the motivation.
