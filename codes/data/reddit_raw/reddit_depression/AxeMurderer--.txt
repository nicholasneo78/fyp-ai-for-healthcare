I don't even know
I don't know if I'm depressed or just the good 'ol sad. I can't fully express how I feel because the inside of my head is a mess. 

I don't want to give what I feel everyday the label of "depression", I feel like it just insults the people who knows they have depression. I have no idea where to get any help for whatever I feel. If I did, I would either be too lazy or too shy to ask. 

I am too lazy. Everything is just too tedious. In everything I do, halfway through it I just feel an intense urge to give up, and I do. I can't find a proper hobby to distract myself from whatever's inside my head. 

I can't focus. It is so hard to focus on anything. I just stared at the blinking blue bar for 5 minutes just to type this unecessary sentence, because I lost whatever I wanted to write here in the maelstrom of thoughts inside my head. 

I used to be smart, or atleast feel smart. Lately I feel like I've dumbed down. Questions that I used to answer easily became hard for me. English, something I was proud of for learning it by myself, became harder for me. My memory isn't what it used to be. 

I'm jealous of other people who can properly comfort their depressed loved ones. Everytime, it pains me that I can't find anything in my head or say anything to make them feel atleast a little better. It eats me inside that I know they're suffering and I can't make them feel that someone cares when they think that no-one does. 

I am a fake.

i'm not sure if any of you will get what I'm saying but, eh. I can't even understand myself.
