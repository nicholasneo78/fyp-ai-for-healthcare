please share with me what you do to feel less depressed
hello, i wanted to talk to somebody else that the people i know in real life, i have really good friends, and most of my family supports me but i dont have the courage to talk to them about how i feel, i know they have their own problems they have to deal with and i dont want to put any more pressure than they already have, ive been struggling with this since i was about 10 or 11, i had alot of stress in my life since i work since i was little, i have never had a relationship with someone and im pretty touch starved, but i just want somebody to talk to, because everyday is getting worse, every day i wake up and dont know why should i keep living, keep trying to get my shit together, why do i matter as a person why even keep giving hopes to the people around me, because i am always there when they need me, but i am too ashamed to ask them for help because in my head if i do so i feel like they would see me diferently and not respect me anymore, i just want somebody that i cant talk to at peace, just talk, please
