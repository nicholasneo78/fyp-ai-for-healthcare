I've never been so alone in my life and its terrifying me
My girl broke up with me by text, and wont return my texts. Saw her at uni today and had a panic attack. All my housemates are away. My parents talk to me once a week. I have no friends. No one to talk to. No where to go. I cant stop crying and the thoughts are back telling me to end it all. I dont know what to do. This is probably more of an /r/offmychest post but I dont know how to keep going. I love her. And she doesnt care about me. No one does.
