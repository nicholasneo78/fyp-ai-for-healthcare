Warning: We're being targeted by a PM-spammer promoting a blog at mentorself.com
###Update (Friday March 9, 11:45PST):  This person has now made several new accounts and is using chat more and PMs less.  The admins have requested that we ask everyone to report chats from the spammer trying to get you to visit mentorself.com  

### * On desktop you can report by pausing the mouse over the flag icon.  

### * On mobile (at least the official app on Android), long-press the message and a "report" option will pop up.  

Previous Update:  We've been informed by the reddit admins that this issue has been actioned, but we're going to leave this post up for a while in case they try to sneak back in.  If you post or comment and then get a chat request or PM that appears similar to the description here, [please let us know](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression).

If you get a PM or Chat after posting here promoting an amateur self-help blog at either mentorself.com or mentorself.wordpress.com, please be aware that this person appears to be broadcast spamming everyone who posts here.   Although we deplore this person's actions, we can't see or police PMs because they don't "belong" to any specific subreddit.  

Please report ALL PMs and Chat requests promoting this site to the reddit admins.   If you're using desktop, there's a "report" link under every PM.  Some mobile apps and clients offer a report option but not all, so if you can't find one, you can also report PMs by sending details to /r/reddit.com.  Use "spam" as the subject line, and be sure to specify that you got the spam to a post you made in /r/depression.

Thanks everyone.  We're disgusted that this person is exploiting our community this way.  

EDIT:  If you need an indication of  how the intelligence of this person rates compares to their energy level, they're tried TWICE to spam their blog to *ME* in response to this post!
