God damn it I'm fucking done. I just suck at everything.
I give up. I fucking quit. I cant handle this world I'm too god damn weak. I don't want to go to school, I can't fucking do it. I haven't even registered but classes start in a few hours and now I need to go beg to be let in why do I do this shit to myself. I'm freaking out god damn it I'm running out of time and I keep digging myself deeper into my lies. I just want to cry all day but I can't even cry anymore. I lay in bed all day imagining a better world and a better me that will never come. I'm scared I'll always be disconnected from myself. I don't want to let my family down so I need to keep going to school but fuck I'm gonna fail and either way I'm gonna get kicked out I don't know what to do. And even worse I keep getting told I need to go get a job. My family aready view me as the stupid let down, and not having a job proves it to them. Everyone just thinks I'm lazy and I am because when I come here I see the real shit others have to deal with and my problems are all in my head. Am I sick or just lazy as fuck? And does it even matter? I cant put my feelings into words. Everytime I think things are looking up, I just get shit on. I want to erase myself from history. Everyone else would be so much better off god damn it I'm such a drain. Why do good people have to die while I'm still around? Just take me instead. I'm debating between driving to school in a few hours to try and get the classes I know I'll fail, or just driving off a fucking bridge. I'm sorry for taking attention away from everyone else here who are worse off than my pathetic confused ass, I just needed to do someting to get these feeling out or I'm gonna blow up and scream
