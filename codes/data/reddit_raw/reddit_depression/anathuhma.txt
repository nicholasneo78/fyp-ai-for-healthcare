i have to get this out, goodnight
on my instagram, i post a message every night telling people not to hurt themselves and other things that might make them feel better. every night, and i've gotten at least a 100 messages back telling me how much i've helped.

but i can't even take my own advice. i don't listen to myself. i have depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts constantly, but it's been getting to hard to fight. i'm exhausted when i wake up. there's so much more, i can't explain.

depression for me like something invisible is suffocating me constantly, literally every waking minute i suffer.

the only thing holding me back is guilt. but i won't feel it when i'm dead. reddit, this might be my goodbye. i'll let you know if i wake up.

if anyone ever reads this, you're stronger than me.
