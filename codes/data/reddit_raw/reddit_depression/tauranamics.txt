Falling in love with someone who doesn't feel the same way is the worst thing I've felt.
 I've been struggling with depression for quite some time now,  but nothing has come close to how shit I feel now. She was my closest friend, we shared everything together. Now we havnt spoken to eachother in over a month and it just amplifies my depressive thoughts. I just can't get her out of my head. There are so many things in my every day life that reminds me of her.  I just wish I could forget everything, just to end this suffering.
