Doctor taking me off meds Cold Turkey
Hi everyone, I've been on Prozac (Fluexetine) since 9th grade. I am a 2nd year student in college now. For the past few years I've been upped from 10mg, to 20mg, and now 40mg. I've been on 40 mg for 3 years. When I went to my doctor it was only to tell him during a check up that I was comfortable with my medicine and dosage, so he would send more prescriptions to my pharmacy. 

During my last visit, I expected it to be a quick and simple check up as usual, but instead he said he was prescribing me "3 more months" of  40 mg Prozac then making me stop cold Turkey because "being on Prozac for more than 6 months is bad". 

I don't understand because he has been constantly renewing my prescription for years and never said anything about tapering off or stopping. I once went a month cold turkey during a health insurance issue and around the 3rd week I had attempted suicide. 

And addressing the "3 months" he promised, I was quickly informed the pharmacy was only given 1 month of medicine for me 

I've been admitted to a mental hospital by my mother after I got raped and beaten, because I drank a lot of alcohol for a few days.

I've been to several therapists. I've been rationing my pills 1 every 2 days, and my mother and fianc√©e who I live with have already seen a drastic change in my behavior. I feel awful because they give me such a nice and comfortable life but I am still depressed. I don't know what to do when I have no more antidepressants after 5+ years and then going cold Turkey. I'm afraid my brain chemistry will convince me to do something stupid and damaging to myself again.
