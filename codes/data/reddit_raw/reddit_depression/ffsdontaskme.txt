I just need to get this off of my chest.
This is my first time posting. I’m not sure if trigger warnings are common place here, but before you read on I would like to say warn that this mentions suicide.

A family member took their life last week and I’m really, really struggling.

I’m absolutely devastated that my children won’t be able to grow up with them around. 

I’m struggling to keep it all together.

I just want to cry all day. But I don’t want my kids to see my crying.

Everyone around me is just carrying on like normal.

I have a history of depression, I’m currently in therapy and on medication. I feel like my family is wrapping me in cotton wool.

When I first found out how it happened, I obsessed over articles that described the process they would have went through while dying. I kept wondering what they were feeling in that moment... if during those last moments they had regret. Then I kept tormenting myself with the “what if?”

I’ve been able to stop doing those. But now... I just want to be a sloth. I want to sit on the couch and watch TV all day. All motivation I had prior to last week has just gone. 

I’ve never had anyone this close to me die. A friend who I had grown apart from committed suicide last year. I was upset,.. but I wasn’t this upset.

Let me stress this - I am definitely not having any suicidal thoughts. 

Due to the unexpected costs we’ve had, I can’t afford to see the psychologist, that’s why I’m posting here.

I’m just so devastated.
