Does anyone else have this constant dark feeling lingering over them?
Recently my mom died and this dark feeling of hopelessness has been worse than ever before. I don't know what to do anymore. Nothing makes me happy, and I don't want to die but I don't want to exist either. I can occasionally enjoy things, but at the end of the day I just think to myself, "why am I still doing this?" Everyone keeps telling me that I have to live for myself and not search for answers through others but I feel like I can't help myself. I feel like no one around me understands what I'm going through. I feel like a robot at work, forcing myself to seem okay. I just feel like living with this feeling inside of me is so hard, and maybe genuinely not even worth it. I don't even feel like taking my medicine or eating heathy or anything. I just wake up, go to work, come home and sleep as much as possible. Sorry to rant on here, I'm not sure what else to do.
