I feel like I'm not cut out to be an adult in this life.
r/GetMotivated hardly helps me so I don't know why I still visit it. I always see some stupid bullshit like, "When life knocks you down, get up and knock it down harder" or whatever. I know it works for some people, but that stuff just makes me angry because it's *so* not me. I'm not a fighter. I don't understand how to just keep pushing and keep going on like that. I guess I've been doing that somewhat if I've made it to be 21 but I'm so fucking miserable. I don't understand how people get motivated and "just deal with it" and all that shit. And I know it's a meme to say that you're fine but don't want to get into because they wouldn't understand but it's so fucking true, and I know I'm just feeding into the cliches. Going back to the title, I think it's entirely likely I'm not meant to survive on this earth. In a universe that's so fucking vast, it makes too much sense for there to be the possibility that some humans just aren't meant to live like everyone else. Maybe I'm destined to kill myself. I'd rather not, I'd rather something else kill me so I *don't* have to deal with it.
