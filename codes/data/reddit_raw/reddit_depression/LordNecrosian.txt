Am i simply lazy or is there something more?
If this doesn't fit this sub please delete.

I'll be short, not the best writer.
I am university student, 25, about to get bachelors degree in programming. Never had a job , leeching from mom. After four years of study i realized that at best i am average, at worst i am below that. Before going to psychiatrist(spelling?), decided to "look around" and see  if there is basis for it or not.

Now,apart from feeling useless and generally thinking that i have no future. I simply don't have any motivation. 

I know i need to do things, i want to do them, but simply cant gather up motivation or focus to do them. I keep switching between other things, starting to watch videos , only to switch to another one, reading articles, browsing reddit until it's too late to do anything.  Then promising i'll do it tomorrow. Worst thing is that i don't really care if i fail. 
Anyone experienced something similar?


TL,DR: Can't gather motivation to do anything, i need to do it, want to do it, but simply can't start doing it. Keep switching between doing other things instead. 
Anyone has any similar experience?
