I almost cried in front of people I know
It was all relatives, they were all chatting and playing, and I sat alone because I felt unwanted and not belonging. Then a wave of darkness hit me, and my eyes got wet and red, right there in the open, and some of them noticed... And that's it, no one tried to talk to my or anything after it.
