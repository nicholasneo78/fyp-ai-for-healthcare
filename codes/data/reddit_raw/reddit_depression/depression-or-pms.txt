Can we talk about personal hygiene, or lack of there of
I really can’t even remember the last time I showered, and it’s not even me enjoying being a nasty bitch I just  don’t want to? I mean, I don’t like feeling dirty or like I smell bad, but the thought of getting in the shower, bathing, washing my face, getting out, putting lotion on , etc. just sounds like to much work. The most I can do is brush my teeth, but other than that I lay in bed. 

I mean I can get up to do things that I like on a good day like painting, but for the most part I lay in bed all day. I don’t want to feel like a nasty bitch of that I’m an “unkempt” girl but at the same time I feel like I can’t help it. I also don’t want to feel like I’m using this as an excuse to be nasty but I just can’t. 

Just a rant because I don’t usually see a lot of people talking about it.
