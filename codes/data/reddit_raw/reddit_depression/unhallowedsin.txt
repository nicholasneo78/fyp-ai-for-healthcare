Am I the only one who believes in fantasies and lies to cope with not killing myself?
I believe that one day, the girl I like will like me back. I believe that she will reconsider rejecting me, and apologize to me and we can be in a relationship as more than good friends.

I believe that I will be prepared for my career when I leave college. I believe that I will find an internship this summer and every summer after that. I believe that I will impress employers with my fantastic resume.

I believe that I will make lots of good everlasting friends in college and that I will make even more friends at my workplace in the next three years. The relationships with my high school friends will only strengthen and we will be a group for decades to come. I believe all of the people I know now.

I believe that I will graduate in the next three years, and that I will be able to get As in my classes to increase my GPA. I believe I can graduate with honors, I believe that I will have enough money saved to actually visit Japan.

I believe all of these things because I know I'm a failure at life, and I know I'm not "built" to survive and dwell in this world. One day, I will end my life just when my fantasies can no longer be maintained.
