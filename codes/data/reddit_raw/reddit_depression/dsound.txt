I get angrier while running
When my depression flares up (mostly in the winter), I get what I call 'the angrys'. As the run gets more intense, I start thinking the darkest, angry thoughts like a swarm of bees around my head. I hate everyone on the street and God forbid anyone get in my way. Usually running makes me feel good and it does later on but during the run, wow.
