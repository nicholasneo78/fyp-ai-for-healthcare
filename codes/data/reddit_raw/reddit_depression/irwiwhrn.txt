Fundamentally Disinterested in Life Itself
Even if I weren't depressed, life doesn't even seem all that appealing.

Work a lousy job 40+ hours a week. Force yourself into social situations. Come home to do errands and busy work. If you're lucky, a hobby or two in any free time you may end up having. Sprinkle in some random tragedies and unforeseen hardships and repeat on loop for 60 odd years.

I absolutely never signed up for this.
