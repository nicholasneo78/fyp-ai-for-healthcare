I've had no energy to do anything the last couple of days and I'm really struggling to get out of this funk
I've had problems with depression for years so none of this is new to me, but I'm having a really rough couple of days and think I'd like to just talk with someone.

Today is the second day I'm missing classes. My first one starts in an hour and I live too far away to get there in time at this point. I couldn't get out of bed, and had the same problem yesterday. I just get this feeling of dread when I think about getting ready and actually leaving, and all I feel like I can do is lie in bed thinking about different ways I could kill myself (I'm not going to, it's just something I seem to always end up thinking about in bed, I know it's toxic but it's comforting).

I really can't miss any more classes after today, this semester is really important for my grades. I feel like such a piece of shit for missing them two days in a row, this is the exact sort of thing that fucked up my grades last term.

Idk it'd be nice to talk to someone, about anything even. I only have one friend who knows I have problems with depression but I don't want her to deal with my emotional baggage.
