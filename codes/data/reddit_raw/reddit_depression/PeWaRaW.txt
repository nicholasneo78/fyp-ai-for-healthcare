I met up with a girl yesterday for the second time
And it was great.We went Iceskating and during it she held my hand for no reason.Afterwards we we drank some Punsch and laughed so much.When she said she had to go I kissed her and she actually kissed back.We're both depressed and for the first time in so long I feel happy.
