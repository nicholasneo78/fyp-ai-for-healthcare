I thought things were getting better...
Sorry for the little rant... I just needed to say this somewhere.

After recently getting out of the hospital for a(nother) attempt at my life, I was surrounded by family and friends who want to support me. For a couple days this almost gave me a high, thinking that maybe I really am glad I wasn't able to go through with it or that maybe I was beating these years of depressiveness. Not even just after a week of getting out of the mental ward, I fantasize about what I could have done differently to have made sure I died that night. Going forward I thought I would be happy being able to see my younger siblings and my dog again, yet the only thing I can think of is them knowing I tried killing myself, and that I have added just another thing to deal with and another burden on them. I will now be treated with *care* and people will be on guard around me, and I didn't want to do that to them. This semester has started again and I have already missed the first week, and while part of me just wants to drop everything, I can't afford to start paying back the loans. I just want to curl into a ball and not exist and have to deal with it all.

TL:DR - trying to take the easy way out has just made everything harder.
