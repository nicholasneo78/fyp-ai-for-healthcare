I hate myself, just a vent, going to delete
I don't even want anyone to read this. I guess all I ever wanted was for someone to want me around. The only way that's probably even possible is if I'm useful at anything. Problem is I am a grade A screw up. 

What am I even saying? I am incredibly short fused, I feel like I'm slowly burning alive. I'm just angry all the time. So people don't want me around, because frankly I'm an asshole. I hate who/what I am and violently hate myself. 

It's like I live in an abusive relationship with myself. I don't want to be this way, but I don't know what to do. I have been getting help, but it hasn't helped any. I'm just jaded, lonely, and it's getting harder to keep going on. I wish I could just go.
