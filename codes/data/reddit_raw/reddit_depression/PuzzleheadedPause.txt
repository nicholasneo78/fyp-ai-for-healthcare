isolation
haven't left my house since October and it's starting to take a toll on me. I'm paranoid as fuck and i'm starting to lose it. Sometimes I can't tell the difference between dreams and reality, I took my phone apart and threw the pieces everywhere so the only contact I've had with people has been on here since then. I want to gain the confidence to take my life and I think I'm on the right track.

I think the only reason i'm scared is because society tells you suicide is bad and my religious upbringing taught me that it's sinful. I don't care about any of that crap anymore, i don't care about anything or anyone
