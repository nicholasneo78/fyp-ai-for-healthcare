Sadness is the only thing getting me through my day
I'm not really sure where to talk about this because the people in my life don't really understand. I feel like I messed up a lot of my life and the track it was going on. Now I'm just very disappointed and sad with myself. I've tried pills and therapy. However, this might sound weird, but my sadness is the only thing pulling me through the day and making it pass by quickly. I don't know how to explain it because most people associate sadness with something they instantly want gone. Anyone else feel this way?
