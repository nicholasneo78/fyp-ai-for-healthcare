I can't even handle the suicide hotline...
I tried calling them and as soon as the guy on the other end started speaking, I had an incredible sense of fear and I started to cry and hung up. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. That guy could be saving lives and i'm here fucking wasting his time. I really should just fucking kill myself.
