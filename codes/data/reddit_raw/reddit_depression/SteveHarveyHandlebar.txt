Ever Feel FB "Friends" Are Lying Out Their Asses?
For real. How the fuck can people post about life being great, life is so good, and being blessed? It's like they want to rub your nose in it how wonderful their life is. While you're wallowing in alcohol/drugs, in a room by yourself, contemplating suicide. 

Sometimes, I just want to call people out on this bullshit but I don't post on FB anymore. No possible way these people are that happy and enjoy life so much. Is it just narcissists? Or are people really this happy and get all the luck in the world?
