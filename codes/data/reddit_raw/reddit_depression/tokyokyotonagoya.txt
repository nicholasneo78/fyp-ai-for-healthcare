Addicted to escapism
If I am not occupying myself with any form of entertainment (games, books, movies, music, drawing, writing, etc.) I feel depression and anxiety. Whatever I do in real life, there is a heavy stone in my chest, if you know that feeling. I cannot escape sadness, boredom and loneliness whatever I do. I only feel really good when I sleep and have wonderful dreams.
