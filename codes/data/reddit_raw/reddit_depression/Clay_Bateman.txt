Anyone depressed in spite of good life circumstances?
A lot of people here are depressed for very good reasons. I really don't have any. I'm pretty happy with my life set up (of course there are some things I'd change but on the whole it's good).

I just have this endogenous, chemical depression that's as bad as being in physical pain. I've been on so many meds in the past and they don't seem to work for me anymore. I run distance every single day and eat well.

Not asking for advice as such, just interested to hear if any of you guys are depressed even though your lives are good on paper.
