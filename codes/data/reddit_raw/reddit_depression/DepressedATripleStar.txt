There is a big chance that I will become a millionaire in a year or 2
I got involved in Bitcoin 2 years ago, bought a lot when it was 500 600 dollars. And based on my bitcoin increasing from trading altcoins and the increasing value in general I believe I can seriously become a millionaire in a year or 2. I am depressed though. I want to figure out how I can reinvest that money. Not for the purpose to make more but how I can make other aspects of my life better. I'd really like to hear what people think.

And also I don't really know how to feel about this. I think it's important to be humble and I never want that to change about me. But I am going to become very wealthy. I have a certain perspective on money.

Money isn't evil, it is a resource. It's power, you can use it for good or bad. I want to become a billionaire. You can save and dramatically change 1,000s of peoples of lives with that amount of money. I'd rather have that power than someone who doesn't have that perspective.

Does this make sense? I just feel this way about money. I feel like people think it's evil and pursuing money is evil. But you can do good things with money. And I want to do that.

How should I feel and think about this? What do you think?

I am going to have money and power but I don't know how to use it to help myself.
