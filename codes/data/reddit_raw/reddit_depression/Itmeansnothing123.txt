I've never liked myself.
Honestly, I think that my entire life I've been depressed, but now that I'm older (19 y/o), I've realized what it actually is. All my life I remember hating myself and wishing I could be somebody else. I thought it was normal. I always envied just about everyone else and thought the worst about myself and every action I took. 

The only time I *ever* felt happy about myself was after a psilocybin mushroom trip. But that's besides the point.

I've always hated myself but I was too naive to know what it was and I thought it was normal. Why can't I be normal?

Edit: You know what, fuck this I'm gonna edit this. I don't think I'll get better. I don't think there is a better way of living. Anytime I am "happy" or "over it", it all comes crashing the fuck down and becomes 10x worse. I don't trust that fucking shit called "happiness". It's always a lie and always lets me down. I'd rather be depressed and suicidal because at least I know it's real. It's not some bullshit fleeting feeling that I get that leads to disappointment. Reddit comments and therapists and shit can tell me I'm mistaken, but that's all bullshit because it's all a fucking lie and the only real emotion is emptiness, fear, self loathing, and paranoia. Sorry, but for me that is it. Case closed.
