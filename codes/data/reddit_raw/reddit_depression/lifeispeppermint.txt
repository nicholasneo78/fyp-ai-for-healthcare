How do you talk about depression to your friends?
I'm really ashamed of not necessarily the depression in and of itself but the way that I have acted with it and the way that I have (so far) failed to overcome its clutches.  This shame has led to me neglecting some relationships because I don't know how to talk about this without seeming really pathetic, which makes me feel even more guilty for neglecting friends that I actually do value, but just can't bring myself to talk to.

So how do you talk about this in a way that seems... I don't know - like - valid?  I don't know what to say.  I've been depressed and unemployed for over a year and now I have a friend calling me and I know that I should talk to them (I even *want* to talk to them - like they're awesome and I really really want them to be in my life again) but the thought of trying to explain myself - it makes me feel sick and disgusting to even contemplate.  What would you say? Does anyone have any good answers to this?

 I really need advice right now.
