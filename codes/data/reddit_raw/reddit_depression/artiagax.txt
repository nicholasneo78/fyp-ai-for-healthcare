For those on antidepressants, is it working? Alternatives to antidepressants?
Okay so I’m going back to a psychiatrist next week for my depression. I’ve been going since high school and over the years have had depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, lack of motivation and interest, high anxiety, numbness, hopelessness, etc etc. recently it’s been coming back.

I’ve been on Zoloft which made me feel like a numb zombie and bupropion which I didn’t feel was working. I’ve also tried Xanax (made me calmer but high) and a mood stabilizer that didn’t really help. I’ve since gotten off medication by my own choice but the problems are coming back. Generally I don’t like rx drugs and would rather do it naturally but it’s not going away.

My question to people is what antidepressants have worked, how long have u been using them, and has ur depression improved? Should I take it for the long term? And what alternative methods have worked for you guys?
