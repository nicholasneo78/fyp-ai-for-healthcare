Do you feel like a burden to other people?
I do. I'm 18. When people make me feel bad about myself or control me in a way I don't like or just get annoyed with me just talking to them I tend to feel really depressed, sad and think of how I wish I wasn't born. I already stuggle to keep and make friends. It hurts me a lot. Makes me sad. It kills me mentally. People just hurt me so much. I don't think I can cope anymore honestly.....
