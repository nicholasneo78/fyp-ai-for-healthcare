Do you ever feel extrem dizziness and vertigo?
Hello,
I've been struggling with depression for some years now. The last year was by far the worst and the first month of 2018 was even worse. The last two days I felt extrem dizziness and vertigo and I wonder if this could be because of my depression and I'm also super stressed at the moment. I have to get stuff done but I can barly move without feeling the need to puke. When I lay down it gets even worse.
Did anyone of you ever experience something like this?
i already tried the usual stuff like drinking more water, eat something with sugar etc. My blood presure seems fine aswell.
