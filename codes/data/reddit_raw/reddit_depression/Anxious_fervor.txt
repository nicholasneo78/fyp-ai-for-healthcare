I don’t think I was cut out to survive in the world.
I can’t make phone calls. I can’t drive. I can’t get a job and work like everyone else. I get stressed out and anxious over everything. I’m 21, only had one job that lasted 3 months. I’m graduating and leaving college behind soon. I know I won’t be able to make it in the working world like everyone else. I don’t think I was supposed to live past high school. I add nothing to the world. I am a leech on society.
