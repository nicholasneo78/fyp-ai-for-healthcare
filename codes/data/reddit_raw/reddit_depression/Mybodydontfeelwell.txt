Why I’m leaving
When I was a kid a had an accident in which I chipped both my front teeth. I was 12 back then, so my dad had the funds and everything but he never wanted to take me to the dentist which went unnoticed for 4 years and just a chip on my tooth became a huge problem, I got a gap and they look uglier than they did. Anyways the thing is just right when i was going to get the work done my dad got deported and I stayed by myself. I’ve been depressed since a kid because of this and my face is actually pretty but my smile is really bad, and is a big cost to fix them since I have no sort of insurance. and I got into this big mess. A long distance relationship for almost a year now and we haven’t seen each other and I don’t want to because he doesn’t know, his name is Ricardo. I’m 17 now and I feel like committing suicide would be extremely selfish and I would hurt him and my family but there is no other way I’m not happy with myself and it is what it is.
