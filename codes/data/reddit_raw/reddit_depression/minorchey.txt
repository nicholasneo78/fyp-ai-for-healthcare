Advice for making it through school
In my second year of college my mental health went down drastically and I lost all of my motivation and basically most of my ability to function. I couldn’t do any schoolwork without panicking and crying because I didn’t think I could do it. I was scared of everything. During finals, my cat died and I just sorta gave up. I failed everything and took a year off. My family was so disappointed and treated me so differently for the year that I was out. About a month and a half before the fall semester of 2017, I got on a new medication and decided to felt good enough to go back to school. I knew I had no other option anyway. I did surprisingly well that semester but now that break is over, I’m finding myself just as terrified as I was that semester I failed. I don’t know what happened and I don’t know how to get back to functioning again. I can’t drop out again. Why do I feel so low after having such a strong start? I really thought things were getting better but I feel like I’m being taken over by this again. If anyone else has any advice for getting through it and regaining faith in myself I’d love to hear it.
