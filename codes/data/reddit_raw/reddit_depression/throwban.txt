How does one "find/define" "themselves"? (and where to post this question?)
Hello everyone,
I've, like many, lost interest in pretty much everything, I only do one thing, from times to times, and I wouldn't consider it a "passion" or a "hobby".  
I need to stop focusing on some things in life, and reconsider who "I" am, and to do this I need to find some hobby and start making friends again, or at least start to enjoy myself.  
  
But how?  
I've tried arts, sports, entertainment, pretty much everything, and nothing really spark an interest, even when I try to get into it for like 2 weeks to a month (after that I don't even want to do it at all).  
  
If you have an idea of where to post this question, let me know.  
  
If you ave any answer, that'd be great.
