19 years old and already miserable
i just need to vent about how lost i feel in life. i have no dreams or ambitions about what i want to do as a career in my life, i have a job now which i suck at even though i basically only help my boss a few times out of the day and i only get about one shift every two weeks. i suck at driving even though its been a couple of months of constant driving practice trying to get my license. i've had girls interested me in the past but not for a long time even though i always manage to fuck it up anyway because im so socially awkward and i honestly feel like im going to be alone for life because i cant make a connection with any girl on earth. I feel like im losing my close friends even though we were all so close about a year ago. I already feel like a disappointment to my parents and i just want to lay in bed and listen to music all day everyday. Please tell this isnt how life is supposed to be, i feel like anxiety and this recurring sadness has taken control over me.
