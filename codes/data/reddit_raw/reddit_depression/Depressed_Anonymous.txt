I probably ruined everything
Tonight I ruined almost a year of work. My girlfriend of 12 years and I had a really rough 10 months, and I have been working really hard to build up our relationship. However, tonight my depression and an existential crisis got the best of me, and I made a stupid decision. I tried to steal a bunch of things from Walmart, but I got caught. Her sister is the manager, and was the one who caught me. I told my girlfriend and she didn’t say anything. I’m worried that I’m going to lose her. If I lose her, I’ll have nothing. I may as well not exist, because she is my only source of happiness. I know I don’t deserve her, but I need her desperately.
