How do you get a job after over a year of unemployment?
F early 20s. I never finished college, came home, and I've been so depressed that I haven't done anything since I left school in 2016. I'm a really hard worker and I've always been liked by my bosses, but I don't feel comfortable giving references because any part time jobs I've had I kind of - just - abandoned. I would get to a point where I couldn't handle the social anxiety and depression and my job would call me to see if I wanted to come back during a break from school and I would never call back. Now I'm in this weird limbo that I don't know how to get out of because I basically don't have any credentials or references and there's a massive gap in my resume that I can't explain.
