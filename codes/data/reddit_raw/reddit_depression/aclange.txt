I’m not sad.
I’m not sad, but I’m lost and have no motivation in doing anything.  It’s hurting my school work, and I am losing my grades.  The only thing I want to do is play video games all day.  I don’t know where to go, I’m just lost.  I’ve asked my parents for help at extreme lows, but they think I’m faking and their insurance is awful.  I don’t know anymore.
