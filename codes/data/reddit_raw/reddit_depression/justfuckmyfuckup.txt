dropped back into a depression, feels like i️ travelled back in time
anyone else feel like this? 

about this time a year ago i️ went through a very rough patch due to depression, and it was one of the lowest points in my life. i️ slowly but surely started to get better, or rather, more numb. eventually i️ was ok. not happy, but i️ could function fine. fast forward to today and i️ suddenly dropped back into my depressed mindset. it’s as though i️ just woke up from a year long sleep, like i’d been going through some fugue state. it’s weird and scary but also familiar and comfortable in the worst ways. i️ feel so awful but life also feels more real than it has in the past year. i️m suddenly remembering all of my regrets and aspirations and relationships that i️ had just pushed down and suppressed and  it’s awful but also it feels like i’ve found a missing part of myself?

 this is ramble-y and i️ don’t know if it makes any sense but i️ just wanted to put it out there.
