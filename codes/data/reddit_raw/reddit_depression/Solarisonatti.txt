I need help to understand it myself
Dear people of r/depression, I need advice for motivation and mental calmness. I have had my share of depression in the past, but I have tried hard, so hard to make my life as happy as I could. 

But I think recently I have lost all my motivation for everything. There are days where I just want to play games and sleep all day because that probably is the only way to keep me bloody sane. Then there are days where I completely fine, but I don't think I have the same fire in me when I was younger. 

Recent mistakes (Failing in my university units, failing to find a job, failure in relationship) are making me nihilistic, self loathing and just feeling really pathetic. 
But of course, I can't just keep using my mistakes as an excuse to not get the fuck up and do something with my life... but I think I have ran out of ideas and motivation to push myself anymore.
