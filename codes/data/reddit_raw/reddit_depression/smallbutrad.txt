It never ends
Some days I just wish I would get hit by a car or never wake up. Today is my birthday and I'm turning 22 and I feel like such a loser. I'm a moody, anxious, depressed piece of shit and I know my friends and family are sick of me and would be better off without me. I haven't accomplished anything with my life, I feel I'm stuck in the same place as I was when I was 18. I relapsed and cut myself last month, probably did the most damage to myself then I ever did. I want to die. I want to talk about it with someone but I'm scared I'll be put into a hospital. And I know how much it would kill my mom if I hurt myself or if I told her I want to die.
