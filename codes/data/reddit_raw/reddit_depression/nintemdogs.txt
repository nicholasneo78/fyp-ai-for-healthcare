Constant worrying is killing me
Has anyone got any help at all to help you distract yourself from someone close to you going AWOL? 

my boyfriend suffers with bad mental illnesses aswell and he's gone awol and hasn't been online in days nor texted me for months but whenever I do call and the rare chance he answers he reassures me that he still loves me. When he's gone my head is just filled with overthinking and worry that it makes me physically so depressed and worse than before. Does anyone have any fucking help for me?
