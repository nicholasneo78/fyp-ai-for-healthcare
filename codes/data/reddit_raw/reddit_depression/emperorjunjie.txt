What is your interpretation of happiness?
Everyone seems to be fixated about obtaining it. Yet when I ask them what happiness is, no one seem to be able to truly give me a definite answer. How can one knows he/she attains happiness when that person doesn't even know what it is in the first place? Its like desperately trying to look for an item in your room but you don't know what that item even looks like. 

So tell me, do you have a definite definition of what it meant to be happy?
