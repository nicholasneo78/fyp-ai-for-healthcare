The life as an adult is soul crushingly lonely and isolating
Seriously, it feels like it gets a lot more difficult to make friends. My best friend moved out of state and I realized I have nobody now. Everybody else I knew back in college/high school is working, has a SO or has kids to take care of.  Iâ€™m just tired of feeling so isolated and not a priority for anyone.
