I was rejected &amp; I feel great
Last night I asked a close friend of mine on a date and was rejected, but strangely enough I don't feel dejected but rather proud and accomplished.

To provide some background, I'll be turning 20 on the 15th, and last year, just 4 days after my 19th birthday, I was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder. This disorder is characterized by long lasting, essentially uninterrupted periods of depression lasting AT LEAST 2 years, and in many cases, such as with myself, far longer. To provide a rough estimate, I have been depressed somewhere around a total of 13 years of my life.

The depression has had a serious negative affect on my love life, at times making me cold and even cruel. The most egregious example of this was when, after having dated this girl for a few months, I stopped talking to her almost entirely and started flirting with other girls. Eventually she had to get her friend to break up with me on her behalf because I was refusing to talk to her. At the time, because of the depression, I thought little of myself, seeing myself as a worthless scumbag, and so I started acting like one. I was also afraid to open up to some else, so instead I became emotionally cold and avoidant. I hated this behavior in myself, and held a deep guilt for how I had treated women I had been with, so about 5 years ago I stopped dating entirely.

Despite being rejected, having finally had the confidence and self respect to ask out a woman and accept the no graciously is a major growth in my self esteem and wellbeing, so having done so I feel a great sense of accomplishment. This has really helped boost my self esteem and confidence, even though I was rejected.

There's no real point to this story, but I just wanted to get this out there, because I'm really proud of the progress I've made so far.
