I can't study. Not even the thing i like the most
I love history. I picked it this year and I can even take it as a hobby. I'm in contemporary history (my favorite period) and I have an exam on WWI and the USSR (it's a lot but that has never been a problem for me). But I can't study it. 

I turn my phone off. I get rid of all kind of distraction. But I can't. I've given up. I've been days trying to study, but my brain can't keep the info. 

I'm going to fail. And the worst part is that I'm passionate about this subject
