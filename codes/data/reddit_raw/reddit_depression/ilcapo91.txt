do naps trigger depression?
can someone relate to this? like most of the time i go take a nap, ESPECIALLY in a sunny day, esp when the sun is setting and i wake up after and hour or two, i feel so lost and the loneliness is reinforced like 10 times. i feel like ive missed out on life and feel more of a failure by just sleeping. like ive wasted time. and the most depressing part is having no one to go enjoy the sunset with, or go out or do anything. its ugh
