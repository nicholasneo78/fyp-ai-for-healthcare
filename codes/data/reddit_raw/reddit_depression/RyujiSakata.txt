I’m 2-3 years I’ll be moving to a state where purchasing a gun is easy. I’ll finally be able to successfully commit suicide.
Been through 11 electroconvulsive therapy procedures (shock therapy), so many medications didn’t work, my psychiatrist and therapist gave up on me. I’m exactly what you think I am, a fucking loser. A kissless, hugless, ugly, worthless virgin. It’s said that the decision of suicide is an impulse, well what if I told you this “impulse decision” has been 7 years in the making. I’m 20 now and man, it’s time to take action.
