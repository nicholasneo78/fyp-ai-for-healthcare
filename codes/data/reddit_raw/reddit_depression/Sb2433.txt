I give up trying, eat healthy, exercises blah fucking blah what’s the point when I still fucking wake up wanting to die and cry myself to sleep every night?
Just lost all hope, I think some people are made for this life and others are just not and I’m one of those people. When will the day come I don’t imagine suicide or my own funeral? It’s been non stop hell for 5 years and I don’t see it ever getting better. I hope for the rest of you it does I really do but for me I’ve just given up I’ve ran out of hope.
