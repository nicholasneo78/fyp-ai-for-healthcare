Can depression make you see only the 'negative' aspects of your SO?
I don't know what to think anymore. I'm in a relationship and maybe we're just not meant to be. 

Did depression ever cause you to only see the negative aspects of your SO? Like you thought to yourself: "His nose looks weird" or "I don't like his hair" or "His teeth aren't even". Things that didn't bother you before... Or that you didn't pay attention to but now now you do?

I'm so desperate. :(
