The one upside of being depressed
I've recently noticed something that has, strangely enough, somehow helped me a bit with my depression.

See, I've started not "sweating the small stuff." For example; stuck in traffic? It's okay. Spilled my coffee? Oh, well. My co-worker is annoying? Doesn't phase me. 
My thought process is like this: when I wake up and feel like dying, at least the spilled coffee gives me something to do in the mean time. Or standing in a queue forces me to be more in the present and not as much in my head. Since I came to realise this, I've noticed an increase in my general mood, or at least I've become better at coping with going outside, shopping etc.
