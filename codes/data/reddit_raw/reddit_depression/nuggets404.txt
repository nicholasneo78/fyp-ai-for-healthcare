I did it bois
This time forreal lmfao.

I'm happy, laughing and grinning for the first time, genuinely out of happiness and not memes/jokes for like over 9 months. 

It is kinda sad that I depend so much on other people, but I think my best friend cured my depression. Honestly got in an enlightening convo with him, I feel really really really great!
