I hate it when bad people get rewarded
One of the facts that depresses me most about life is when bad people get rewarded and live comfortably, and loved by all.

It's hard for me to stomach. 

For example, I saw one of my former bullies enter the store I work at. She was absolutely terrible toward me when we were in high school, such as defacing my sketchbook, purposefully kicking my food away, sending me fake "love letters", and more. Anyway, the bully now had two children (I'm having trouble conceiving so that stings), and I think the bully could smell my fear because she headed right to my counter, and began to make a show of how expensive everything was in our store while also "catching up" by telling me about how successful she is with her self made interior design business.

When I got home that night, I looked her up on Facebook, and...she does have a much better life than mine. In every way. I feel angry that she seemed to have a great one while I've...struggled.
