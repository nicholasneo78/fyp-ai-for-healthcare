My girlfriend died and I don't know how to go on...
She had cancer and was 27.. We've been together for 9 years and were going to marry in a couple of years.. We had lived for 2 years by now and everything was going perfectly.. maybe too much.. We were faithful, devoted to each other. She was my oxygen, I was hers. She was my first and truly love. I've never been with any other girl but her.. 
I feel kinda depressed and alone.. We had no many friends, so that just the two of us was enough for the most part of our lives.. I'll leave for our house next week, since I've been with my family so far.. I'm joining my old job again, but this time, no one will wait for me at home, my salary will be just for me, and all that mattered now it doesn't..  I've got no reasons to keep on living. Somebody tells me I should be glad to still be in this life. But as I see it, it's a curse, a damnation. She doesn't suffer anymore, as I am every second of my life now.. 
Just wanted to open up to you...
