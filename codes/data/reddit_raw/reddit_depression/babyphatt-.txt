Does this mean i need antidepressants? How are you supposed to feel when you take them &amp; they’re effective?
i’ve been feeling depressed since i was 19, i’m 21 now. i learned to live with my depression. i took group therapy, then individual therapy but didn’t find comfort/couldn’t open up to my therapists. i don’t talk to anyone about my issues, so kinda now have a feeling of numbness. i kinda learned to live like this. i feel normal, i used to feel like there was a cloud over my head at all times. 

My older brother is severely depressed &amp; was prescribed Zoloft. he offered me a one &amp; i took it in the late afternoon. i felt more outgoing, him &amp; i hung out. 
The next day, i went to work &amp; was doing an outstanding job with my performance.  i didn’t mind being at work. after i had a break at work, i ate a bagel &amp; then i was in the GREATEST mood ever. i was so happy. a customer even called me out for being so smiley, but i couldn’t help it. i cleaned my entire house, i applied for Spring classes for school &amp; even was thinking of long term dreams of becoming a lawyer. i loved how positive i was feeling. 


i smoke weed, i felt exactly like you feel when you’re high, except i didn’t feel slow. is this how antidepressants are supposed to make you feel if theyre working? i kind of want some now if it means i love life
