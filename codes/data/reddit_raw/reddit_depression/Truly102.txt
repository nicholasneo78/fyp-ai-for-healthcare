Losing my mind at 20!
So the best label I can put is depression I don’t know if that is what I’m really going through tho long story short I grew up in a pretty bad environment had a single mother (now that I’m older I understand stand that it must of been hard being a single mom but what I was put thru is still no excuse)who was very abusive verbally and physically I remember having brooms broke across my back and head for simply spilling a drink, when I was 16 I was stabbed by mother and was taken to the hospital of course like many children who are abused I did not speak up I guess because of fear but more because I didn’t want to be looked at like a sick puppy over the years I was able to cope with my environment and it became normal the part that I don’t understand is when I was 18 I decided to leave and with no real support I was homeless for a bit I used to set daily goals for myself so I wouldn’t let depression set in like find a job,etc I bought a car with the little money I had and slept in that and went to the gym to shower strangely enough that is when I was at the most happiness I have ever felt flash a year later I’m 19 have an apartment a good job and have the whole world in front of me but I’m not happy and it’s been a year I’m 20 now and feel like I’m 60 I have no drive and think about ending my life everyday I just simply feel numb or like im not connected to body I also didn’t mention that I have siblings and I think about them all the time I think that I’m a terrible person for leaving them to live in that environment when I’m free enjoying life anytime I feel joy it’s instantly sucked from me because I began to think about my siblings and think what they are going thru right now I wonder if they love me or hate me and its been taking a toll on me physically and mentally and at this point I don’t know what to do I haven’t tried reaching out because that would mean I would have to see my mother and I’m no longer afraid of her she simply doesn’t deserve to see me at all I sometimes think when she’s on her deathbed will she ever feel any remorse for what she has done I also think when she goes to take her last breath will she wonder about me she hasn’t seen me since I left and she won’t ever again
 Any thoughts on what I should do?
