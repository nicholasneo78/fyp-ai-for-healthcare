girl
So in the past 2-3 months i been talking to this one girl. I love everything about her and we really clicked together, seeing as we're both socially retarded. Literally everything's been looking up, i started working out, being generally happier and more carefree even in social environments.

I'm not exactly depressed, just don't really feel much emotion and I don't relate to people around me. Never been a fan of going out and I've had major problems getting to know anyone (I only have 1 very close friend, besides her). I've always had the feeling that I'm tolerated but not wanted whenever I'm around others, but this chick changed that completely. I actually started to look forward to waking up in the morning and meeting her at uni. On a side note we also like pretty much the same things - similiar music taste, similiar views, similiar feeling of being a reject and ofc vidya games, books and other shit.

I knew I was steadily falling in love with her (something I honestly thought impossible before) and just recently I found out she's got a boyfriend. I proceeded to spend the next 2 hours crying like a little bitch for the first time in over a decade. After that I couldn't even hit any fucking awp shots in cs cause I still had tears streaming from my eyes. My question is, have I reached the point of being pathetic enough that I should call it quits and neck myself?
