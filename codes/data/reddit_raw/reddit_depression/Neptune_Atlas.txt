My gf is planning on killing herself and idk what to do...
Ok so me and her have known each other for 9 months. We are in a long-distance relationship. We have never met in real life. I think she may be bipolar. One night she told me she cut herself a little bit. On her thigh. At first I thought she was joking. She showed me the mark if lefted in the morning and I knew it was serious. She is 16 and I am 18. She has told me before she wants to die. She has had a bad past with men but I won't go into any details. It was just really bad. She doesn't talk to her parents about it just me. Her mother and father may get a divorce so that makes this situation even worse. She can be really happy at times then really down. We get in fights sometimes but they are usually resolved. She always complains she is a bad gf because she treats me like shit. I forgive her for doing so because of her shit life. Today we were just talking casually and a few mins later she said I will kms on said date. Then I told her why would u. She said love u bye. We then went back and forth until I decided to leave her alone. She said she wasn't feeling ok. But I have never heard her give me a date before. Saying you will is one thing but a date means you have planned out how u want to go. I didn't tell my parents the full story and neither has she. She has tried killing herself before. I didn't know her at the time. She doesn't have any friends in real life and the ones she does have just use her. She is also behind in school which stresses her out. I will go into more details if anyone is willing to help me and thank u for hearing me out.
