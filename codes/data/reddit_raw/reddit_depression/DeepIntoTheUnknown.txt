Dealing with loneliness?
I can’t speak to a therapist, I can’t change my reality, I can’t even really take a step forward. My situation is what it is; there is no solution at the moment. I have to live and deal with where I’ve gotten myself, and I have to continue to work to get myself to a different place, so loneliness is my reality. I truly don’t have anyone to talk to right now. Haven’t really for a while. Does anyone have any tips on dealing with loneliness? I’ve been dealing with it in very unhealthy ways lately. I need to figure out how to accept it and live with it.
