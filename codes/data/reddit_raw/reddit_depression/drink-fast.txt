i canâ€™t have string lights in my room.
this gonna sound dumb as hell but there was a period of time where i had string lights in my room and i was really depressed and dysphoric during that time and now whenever i try to put them up and turn them on it just reminds me of how sad i was? i want to be able to enjoy them without feeling like shit and not associate bad memories with them
