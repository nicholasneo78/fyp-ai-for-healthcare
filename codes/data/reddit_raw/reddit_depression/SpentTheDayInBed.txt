Does anyone else straight up hate themselves?
This more than anything reflects onto my own low self-worth, confidence and general view of modern day life. I really struggle seeing the positive in anything. I'm well aware this turns people away from me but even so, it's very difficult to break out of. I can't find the same lust for life that others seem to have. Everything to me basically comes down to: "Meh, what's the point." I don't like looking at myself in mirrors, by my own admission my personality is bland and empty and I can't really connect with people. I often wish for something bad to happen to me in my head.
