A stranger hugged me yesterday
I was crying yesterday talking to my professors because I was having an awful day. And this stoner kid comes into the room because he didnâ€™t realize we were having a conversation. He felt really bad and gave me a hug and left. He was definitely high but it made me feel slightly better.
