When your only constant is not a constant anymore, even if it is it doesn't feel like one. What do you to not fall into the pit you've worked so hard to climb out of?
I've had a bad home situation for a couple of years now, it's not getting any better soon.
The constant I'm talking about is my boyfriend, my supportive supportive boyfriend. But recently he moved overseas and now we for talk 30 mins everyday.
My friends are all attending universities while I'm here waiting for the dream I've always had.
I've had suicidal thoughts when I was younger, I googled it one day and mistakenly I told my friend. She got so fucking serious. So then I told her it was all a big joke. And it eventually started to look like one.
Nowadays, it's getting harder to cope up each and everyday. I can't seem to concentrate on my college apps. I'm not a suicidal person, I just need the happiness I crave. And being negative isn't helping at all.
I just want to be happy again.
