I feel so down and disappointed sometimes
I am 29 female and on verge of breaking down completely. I am facing a lot of rejections in life only because I don't look so beautiful in front of others eyes. I just don't believe that saying "Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder" . There is nothing like that. People just look at me like I am from some alien space. It just breaks my heart :(
