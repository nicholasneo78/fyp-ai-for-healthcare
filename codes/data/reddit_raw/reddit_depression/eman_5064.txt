Anyone else feel bad for their parents for having to deal with a depressed kid?
I’ve been feeling so bad for my parents lately. They try so hard to help me and spend so much time and money on getting me medicine and therapy. But still, I always let them down and show now sign of improvement.  I’m such a disappointment both to me and those around me.  

I hope you guys can relate.
