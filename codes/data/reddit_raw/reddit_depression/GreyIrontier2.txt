I’m the “funny guy”.
When I’m near people I love (anybody that shows a moderate amount of affection towards me) I always try to bring them up. Life sucks for all of us. I just want to make people happy.

I’ve always been pretty good at telling jokes, which is weird since I’m super introverted and if I’m not joking I’m super quiet.

The problem is that no one knows when I’m telling the truth. I’ll try to come out to people. I’ll try to tell them about my drug abuse. I’ll try to tell them about who I am. 

Nobody wants to listen. Everyone assumes that the funny guy is just fine. Nobody wants to have a genuine conversation because sometimes I’m a real fucking downer.

So yeah. There’s my rant.
