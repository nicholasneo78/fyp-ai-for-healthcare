I kinda like being depressed after dealing with anxiety
As a lot of people, I have both depression and anxiety disorders. 

Basically a thing happened in July, which caused me to have constant panic attacks and overall brutal anxiety until around October, when I just transitioned into deep depression. It was however a big relief. I was completely empty, I didn't care about anything. It was 100x better to me than fucking anxiety. When I'm depressed, I don't feel 'bad'. I don't feel good either, but I'm fine with that. I don't feel anything, it's kinda relaxing.

The downside - when I was in the deepest state of depression I was really close to killing myself and I also threatened to shoot up the school, after which police took me to a mental hospital. I've been here for over 3 months now. I did some really bad things, I acted really bad, but on the inside I felt better. When I'm anxious I don't do mean things to people, but on the inside I'm dying, I feel vulnerable and just want help.

I understand that depression is awful and people suffer from it, I see what it does to people on this sub. I just wanted to add my experience, since it's different to everyone else's.

Anxiety makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack, like I'm going crazy, I sweat, I shake, it feels literally like torture.

Depression is the exact opposite. It's calmness, not giving a shit about anything, basically relaxing. I feel kinda comfortable being depressed. I lie on the bed and look at the ceiling, at the wall, whatever. Like I'm on autopilot.

Right now I have both, which just feels fucking weird, I can't even describe that.

Sorry if I offended anyone. I know some people prefer to feel something, but I'm fine with being an empty shell.

tl;dr - depression &gt; anxiety for me.
