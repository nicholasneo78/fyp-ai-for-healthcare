I think I'm going to give up the fight soon enough.
Almost another year past, another year deeper into the hole.


Don't worry, whoever reads this. I'm not gonna off myself. Not yet, at least.
No ones gonna read this.


Best of luck to everyone else out there currently struggling. Hopefully things start to look up for you.
