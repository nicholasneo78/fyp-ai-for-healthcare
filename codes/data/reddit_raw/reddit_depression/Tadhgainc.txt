I just failed some classes and now my family is disappointed in me.
I just ended the semester today and I failed 2 out of my three classes and now everyone in my family is looking down on me and talking about how I used to be so smart and That I'm not now. At dinner, they were making jokes about how I'm not gonna graduate and how I'm not gonna get a job. My mom knows about my depression and even my past suicide attempt and self-harm. She just decides to brush it under the rug and act like it doesn't exist. I tell her how I am trying my hardest and how I gave it my all and she is just thinking that I am lazy. This is all bullshit. I bet they couldn't last an hour trying to deal with I deal will every day. Fuck this.
