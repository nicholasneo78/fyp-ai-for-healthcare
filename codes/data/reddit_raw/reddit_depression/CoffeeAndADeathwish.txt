I can't fucking handle this life
How do people do it? I'm supposed to be happy, because I live in Norway, one of the best places to live. How the fuck can I? The thought of all those innocent people murdered just so that the westerners can live comfortably, it just makes me sick. There's no logic to any of this, I'm born into an uncaring and cold world, forced to work my ass of 9-5 every day, just so some corporate asshole can get more money. I earn a fraction of that amount, and then I have to pay some of that to the government. The government then tries to keep me "safe", by threatening me with involuntary commitment. They're just trying to keep their livestock in check. We're all just slaves, and no one else seems to understand that. There's this weight on my shoulders, this expectation for me to be something. I can't fucking understand how everyone is okay with this. I want out.
