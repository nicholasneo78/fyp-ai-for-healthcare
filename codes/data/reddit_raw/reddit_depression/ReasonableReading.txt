Sleeping to avoid hurting myself
Sleeping seems like the only way to keep myself from self-harming. I have bipolar 2 (heavy on depression, light on mania), so my depressive episodes always pass. I just feel like sleeping is the only way to stay safe until it does. 

My therapist uses medication as a last resort, so I’m not medicated. I should be, clearly, but she’s kind of a hippie. I’m not. If the drugs will keep me from wanting to or attempting to kill myself, then give me the fucking medication. 

Having a rough week. Just want it to pass.
