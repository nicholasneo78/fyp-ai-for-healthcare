Whenever I try to change my life these thoughts pop up
Had depression and anxiety for years and have many times tried to make changes to my life. But I can't shake the thought that says: "why bother?". "Why suffer through all that extra pain that change requires just for a long shot chance of a normal life?".

And on top of that I don't even know if I want a normal life! I Often think that the only thing that separates myself from the "normal people" (in lack of a better word,) is that the "normal people" have an easier time fooling themselves, a bigger capacity for self-delucions. And if happiness can only come from convincing yourself of existential lies, I'm not sure if that (happiness) is for me...

Has anyone else struggled with these thoughts? Does anyone know how to motivate yourself to change when it seems so futile?
