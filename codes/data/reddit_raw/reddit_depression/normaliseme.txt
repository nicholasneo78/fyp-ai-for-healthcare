What would you do?
What do you do when your depressions effects you so much to the point you don't eat or you over eat, you don't sleep or you over sleep, you don't talk to anyone or pretend to want to be around people. What do you do when your depression doesn't allow you to be motivated and takes away all the enjoyment from your life that makes you happy, removing music, dancing and laughing in replace for dark rooms, teary eyes, and silence. What do you do when you won't answer your phone being that only the bill collector is calling, cause you're not able to pay the credit thats pilling up that helps you survive, being that you can't work or can't make money cause of no interest too cause of lack of motivation, cause the thoughts running through your head being that you can't talk to anyone, or that you won't, or that you're disappointed, or that you feel like a burden. Now your phones off and there's no call but the collector is there, no text this shit isn't fair, so what's next? Social media? You can make it or it can break you, driving you to want to do the very thing you try not to think of day by day because you don't know what to do. What would you do?
