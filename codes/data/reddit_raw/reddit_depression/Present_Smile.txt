Dreams of ex
Just as things were getting better, it all crumbled on me with dreams of her. We broke up in early December, no contact ever since.

It's been a horrible struggle recovering from the breakup. My coping techniques aren't working and I am slowly starting to give up at this point, sick and tired of feeling miserable.
