Looked at bank statement, saw 100 less than I expected, almost had a breakdown.
Been having to eat out a lot for reasons I don't really want to get into and are really upsetting to think about. Checked my bank statement and saw that I had a hundred fewer dollars than I expected, looked at the charges, saw how much more I was eating out than I'd expected having had to, got really upset and resentful about my situation, which compounded how upset and resentful I was about "missing" the money in the first place.

Really not doing good right now.
