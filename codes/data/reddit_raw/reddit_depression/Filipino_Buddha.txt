Im about to spend two years of my birthday and the holidays alone. Again.
I spent the holidays and my birthday in Basic Training, and its about to happen again. I stay in the barracks because I have no one to hang out with due to them being on leave. I can choose to go home, but it's too expensive and I do not have the funds to do so, all of my family is back at home. I do not have any friends to hang out with and finding friends off post is even harder for me.

I can not drink because I'm underage. This sucks.
