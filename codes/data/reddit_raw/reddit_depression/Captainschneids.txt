Life for me is gonna fall apart and it'll be the end of me
(this is my first post and I'm on mobile so sorry if the formatting is off)

 So recently my parents have been on me (M 17) about getting a job, getting college information, SAT information, getting my licence and spending more time with the family. Tonight they both came at me and yelled about how I wasn't going to amount to anything and that I pretty much am ruining their current lives. They threw so much at me that it broke me and I broke down in the bathroom. 

My only remedy for all this pain is my girlfriend. She's there for me no matter what and understands what I go through. Recently I've been slipping a little in my grades (All B's and C's) and my parents have a very strict rule that if I don't keep good grades I'll have to leave my girlfriend. My problem is that if I leave her I'll have nothing to help me get through hard times. I'm only living for her and I'll have no point to be around otherwise. 

Sorry for venting but I've been wanting to post here for months but never felt as if my problems have been worth it.
