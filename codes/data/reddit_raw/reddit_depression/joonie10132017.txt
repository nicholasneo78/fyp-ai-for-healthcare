I want to be unloved so I can die without any attachments
I like to drive people away. I try to be rude to my family. I get too anxious to keep up positive relationships with others, I'd rather be alone so when the time comes when I want to kill myself, I won't be held down, and I won't have anyone tying me to this world.

It's hard though. It hurts me to push people away. But it's for the best. I wish I had no attachments. I wish I had no family or friends to try to connect with, I don't want them to be sad when I die. My ultimate goal in life since I was 13 was to die in peace without any attachments to the world, or leaving enough money for my family. They shouldn't have to waste their care and time on someone like me.
