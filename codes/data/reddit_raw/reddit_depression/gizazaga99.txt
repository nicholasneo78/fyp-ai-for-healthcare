I know you shouldn't need someone else to complete you but...
I feel so alone and empty and the few times I've ever felt truly happy is when I'm with a guy, whether he's using me or not. Idk it's led to me getting my heartbroken a bunch, I let so many guys use me too but I guess in a weird way I was also using them? I was never really in love with any of them except for 1 and was mostly in it because I loved the idea of a relationship. I don't like being alone and I fear I'll never find someone I truly love and who loves me, leading to me living my life full of sadness and regret
