Has your mental illness ever resulted in failing a course or degree? How do you get over that?
I may very well be failing my graduate degree right now. It is a one year Master's program and there is no time to be failing a course without failing the whole damn thing. I can't even type how devastating and embarrassed I am. Not to mention throwing away literally tens of thousands of dollars that I will have to pay back, some that my parents invested in me and supported me with. I want to crumble. I think being awake hurts. My hair hurts.
