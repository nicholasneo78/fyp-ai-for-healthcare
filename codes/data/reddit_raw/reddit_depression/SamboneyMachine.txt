I've never felt more alone in my life and I don't know what to do about it.
I recently graduated high school with a decent amount of friends but have only really kept in touch with about 3 of them. I'm going to a college two hours away so the likelihood that I'll be able to even see those 3 people is kind of dwindling once I move. 

I used to deal with loneliness through friends on PlayStation but even those relationships feel like they're getting distant. I recently started talking to my former best friend from PS4 whom I've known for about 7 years but ever since he started seeing someone it feels like he's gotten meaner to me and doesn't care to be there for me in the same way anymore. 

I'm not sure if I'm depressed but I've never felt more alone or lost or confused in my life. I've managed to convince myself that I have no redeeming qualities and that my friends are only pretending to like me because they feel bad or somehow feel obligated to maintain a facade of friendship. 

I just want to feel important to someone. Or at least okay enough with myself that I don't need the validation of a relationship to feel valuable.
