Hi! We are YourAmigo
Hi!

I’m A.M. and I’m writing to introduce a new initiative named YourAmigo. Basically we are a group of friends that have to decided to form this initiative to help anyone who need an “amigo” (Spanish word for friend). We work by assigning anyone who wants it, an “amigo” with whom you can talk about anything. We don’t accept donations, though if anyone wants to help us or has any suggestions, feel free to contact us.

Let me explain who we are :)

We are not therapists, and we realize that we are not capable of solving your problems, or even comprehend your pain; but we can listen to you. We want to hear your stories, we want you to tell us whatever you’d like to say. In the end we just want you to feel heard. And of course, you will never be judged.

You know guys, we have all been there, in that cold and lonely place. For some, this place will be terrifying and called depression, for others it might be something less severe. But we don’t care. If it is important enough for you to feel bad about it, then it would be an honor for us to hear about it. 

Here’s how we work: below you have the email address where you can find us. Please write us. In your first email, you can tell us anything you want, though a little bit of your story is always welcomed (though not required!). And that’s it!

Here’s our email address: youramigoam@gmail.com

And that’s it! Last but not least, I want to thank you for reading this far. I really encourage you to text us. Moreover feel free to copy and paste this message in any other forum: the more people that read this, the more people we can help!

See you soon!

A.M.
