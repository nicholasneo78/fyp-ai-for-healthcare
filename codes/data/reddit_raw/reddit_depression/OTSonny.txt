I think things could get better
I just recently posted about how I thought all things were awful and ranted about feelings and stuff, and well, idk what came over me but I think things may get better? At least I hope so! It’s long overdue if it does, but I guess I can’t complain. I feel a sense of hope I haven’t felt in a long time. I hope this feeling lasts... 

I hope everyone is doing well, please be safe &lt;3 

I tried something last night that I’m ashamed of now...I thought it’d make things better and as I tried I was overcome with regret. Please don’t ever do something you’ll regret. Or anything stupid for that matter. Life your life as if it was your last. Your life was given to you for a reason, don’t end it yourself. It’s a gift..things will get better..just gotta be patient. 

Thank you to all those who responded to my last post, it really means a lot. It showed me I’m not alone in this, it helped me a lot.
