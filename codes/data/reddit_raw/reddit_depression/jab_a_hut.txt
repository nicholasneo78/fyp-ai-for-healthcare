Trying to understand my depressed SO
I'm sorry if I'm posting in the wrong sub. I just figured you guys could offer perspective

So my SO is away for work (for more than a month), but we are still in the same time zone. Lately, he's been having bad episodes, but a week ago he said he had a really session with his therapist there. (I'm proud to say that he said I was the only person who managed to convince him to seek professional help!) So, okay, so far so good. 

When he has bad days, sometimes he likes to "check out of the world". He also feels that opening up about his struggles might be too much of a burden for me. But we had a discussion before wherein I said, I understand that you might need space, but let me know if you're having a bad day, and you're not in a chatty mood. Not sure if this was the right approach, but this was the time before the therapist and after we learned that he had to be away for more than a month. And for the most part, he's been open with me. 

This weekend really bothered me because it was radio silence, despite my check ins, and despite not asking "how are you questions". For example, we are both big football/soccer fans so I tried to talk about the World Cup. He is a huge fan of the French team which won the Cup.  Nothing. 

My anxious nature is making things more challenging because now I'm thinking is it the depression or relationship issues? My anxious self might pester him for answers but I am not sure if that is helpful.

So, I'm not sure how to go about this. Let him be and try not to freak out until he returns? Advice greatly appreciated. Thanks
