My latest depression has a cure, and it's my girlfriend.
So this is my story about a severe depression and anxiety I have been experiencing these months. 
TLDR, we kinda broke up back in April, we had some issues regarding me being a prick. But, she forgave me as we have a perfect relationship (that's right, I do think it's marvelous). But for some important reason that I don't wanna give details in, we can't be together anymore.
So, I started having anxiety attacks, and all my world was like hell, it was so bad, I felt like I had to do something about it.
Anyways, I am fighting to be back again with her, and she also is waiting for me.
We all dream about things or situations where we would allegedly be happy with: money, being successful.. all that kind of stuff. 
Here's what I have learned: When I dream about all this stuff, at the end the only thing, I mean, my only desire, the only thing that I crave in this world, and which I would be crushed to not have, is her.
I'm a person who deeply depends on others, I previously gave myself into deep friendships, but after all, and after all experience, my only friendship and relationship I'm keeping with is my girlfriend.
She literally is my everything regarding my happiness, and me being alive. 

Here's the summary: I wanna go back with my girlfriend, and I am depressed and sad if I'm not with her. I know we'll be hopefully soon together, but as the meantime, I feel like my days are worthless and my life is meaningless.
