I [18F] finally feel like i’m getting better
I was diagnosed with depression about 4 years ago. Honestly every single day for the past 5 years I have debated killing myself, I tried a few times but I was unsuccessful. Really I was down in a hole, couldn’t seem to find an escape.
My parents tried their best but were at a loss.

Finally, I met A [18 M] last september and we started dating in July. And he has been the most supportive person i have ever met, would take days off of work to take care of me when I was too sad, would help me talk through things, told me why he loved me and that the flaws didn’t matter to him. He is the absolute best and I haven’t even thought about suicide for the past three months.

It gets better, I was really lost, was hoping i would die and I found my cure. Maybe your cure won’t be someone else, maybe it’ll be medicine or yourself but please don’t give up because i would have regretted it so much. The world has so much more to offer
