I feel worse everyday and I'm worried I'll have some type of breakdown
I cry every single day, it's been 60 days.
 I talk about it but is like talking to noone at all. I talk all the time. 

My self worth used to fluctuate between "oh, i think i am good?" to "I'm trash" intermittently but lately it's just the bad one. 

I feel like I don't deserve happiness, love, attention. 
 
I'm worried about how long can I take this. Can I become numb at some point? This part it's just extremely painful and I don't think I can deal.
