I just had an abortion.
I haven't been feeling right mentally lately. I'm used to feeling numb because i have depression so i know what its like to feel like shit, but i cant really describe i how feel right now and to be honest i think thats a bad thing. I know that i made the right choice but..i didn't think that at 18 i would be making this choice. At 18, i should be getting ready for college and figuring out my major not mourning the death of my child. I feel like such a loser. All my friends and family are getting ready to start this new and exciting chapter in their lives and I'm in my room crying like an idiot because not only did i have an abortion but i also just lost my shitty part time job. So now I'm broke and emotionally drained. great.
