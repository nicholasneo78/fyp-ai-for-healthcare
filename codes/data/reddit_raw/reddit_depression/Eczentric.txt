Just cut off all of my friends and I’m feeling alone and regretful
Posted this to r/advice but I think that wasn’t the right place for it. 

I just cut ties with nine people who I considered “family” for almost 10 years. Their negativity and inability to understand what I’m working towards has literally taken a huge toll on myself. ‪Friends are supppsed to support you through the good and the bad but instead I was being anchored and every time I felt I was getting out of it I was pulled back down.  ‬The fact that I was so attached to them made this one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do in my life and it took every ounce of myself to finish telling them I didn’t want anything to do with them. They don’t understand that in order for me to become a doctor I have to commit a lot of time to my studies. But if I can’t show up to something such as drinking I get absolutely torn apart by them. It’s like they hate when I’m productive but they enjoy seeing me partake in stupid shit. They’ve told me that I’m a liar and a terrible friend on numerous occasions and it’s just too hard to even reason with them at this point. Did I over react and should I iron things out with them? It’s just since I was so attached to them I don’t know how to deal with this situation. I’ve had so many good times and years with them but lately it’s been so difficult.
