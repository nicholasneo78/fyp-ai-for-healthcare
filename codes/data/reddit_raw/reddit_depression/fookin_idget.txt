Help me
I want to be successful but i never have the will to be productive. I blame myself for that. As i should. 

My issues are that My momâ€™s constantly calling me a disappointment and compares me to my sister. Im a let down. I just want to make my mom proud of me. I work 1 job and i go to college full time. My gpa is fucked :/ 

 I feel stuck. I wish i had someone as an anchor to support me but i dont have people i feel comfortable telling things to. 

Wish i had a gf. Everyone rejects me =,= 

I feel alone. And worthless. Im not successful and im worried ill never be. I dont know how to solve any of this.
