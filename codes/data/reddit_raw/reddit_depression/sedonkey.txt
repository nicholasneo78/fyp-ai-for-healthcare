When did you decide to get help? What was the tipping point?
I’m been having thoughts and feelings lately and I want to compare them to when other people decided to take the plunge. There are days when I’m happy but most nights and some days are not as good. Recently I’ve been struggling and I try to remind myself that it’s not so bad and I could have it worse etc. But anyway. I don’t want to go into a lot of detail or get really personal but for context I’m a college senior. I went to a psychiatrist when I was young (like 7 or 8) and I took medicine for depression but they made me aggressive according to my mom so I didn’t take them long. I haven’t seen anyone, including a school counselor, since then. However in late high school/early college I struggled with self harm. These days I just feel so tired and empty and I just want to sleep.
