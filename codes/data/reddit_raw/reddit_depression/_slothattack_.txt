Need help with suicidal wife, please.
My wife is at work right now and to give a tl;dr, she hasn't been well for a while. I told her months ago that I wasn't sure if I could still be in a relationship with her anymore. She really needed a therapist so I really encouraged her to go. I think she may have only gone in an effort to save our marriage rather than herself. She's gotten new meds and this has happened over about 6mo. Last night I found a long search history of methods of suicide and I found a suicide note post dated a month from now. She's giving enough time to prepare everything. I'm not sure what to do. I plan on having a sort of intervention with her friend, mom my and hers to pursuade her to go to the hospital voluntarily, which I don't think shell do. Idk what to do. Idk what to tell my kids or how to handle any of this.
