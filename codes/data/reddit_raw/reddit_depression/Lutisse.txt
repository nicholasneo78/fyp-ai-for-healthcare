I wish I won't wake up when I go to sleep tonight
I got tons of acquaintances but not friends. I wish I have someone to talk to, about things I like, things I'm passionate about. It doesn't help that I'm aloof and unfriendly.      
          
Wait... I forgot I no longer have a passion for things anymore. I'm so alive outside, but I'm pretty much dead and rotting on the inside. I wish I'd die already. Fuck.
