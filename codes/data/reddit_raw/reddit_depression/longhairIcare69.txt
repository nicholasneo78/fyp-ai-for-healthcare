Life is so fucking bullshit
You think your family cares about you and would do anything to help you, but that's a fucking lie. Both my parents said they went through a "deep depression" that was as bad or worse than mine when they were my age, yet they show 0 interest or care in helping me. I have a sore throat? Oh Jesus go to the walk-in clinic immediately! I say I'm extremely depressed and feel no happiness anymore? Oh yeah we can totally fix that by having a talk every 3 months with you when you have a mental breakdown. I feel like they want me to die since they don't give a flying fuck about my mental state, and when we talk about it they just say shit like I have to be more positive. I've started working out again last week, something I couldn't do for almost a year due to being injured, and I feel nothing from it. I used to love working out so much but now it feels like something that betrayed me, as I'm always gonna be doomed to be skinny because I'm too depressed to have an appetite to eat enough. Fuck sakes I hate my life that's slowly being wasted everyday. I dreamt of being a famous celebrity, but instead I'm here.
