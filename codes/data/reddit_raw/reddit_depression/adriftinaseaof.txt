How to avoid a relapse?
I've been having a particularly rough year; I attempted suicide, the love of my life left me, I failed my year at university, I've been physically assaulted, I've been sexually assaulted and today my grandfather died. 

I feel like I'm running on empty and doing the bare minimum to survive for myself while trying  to be a rock to others. My emotional resilience has been wiped out. I feel "okay" but I've felt like this in the past and it has turned out that I've just been lying to myself and making things worse.  

Any advice on how to manage/process my emotions? Or just how to better understand myself?
