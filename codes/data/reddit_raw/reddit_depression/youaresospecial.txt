Officially by myself.
Texted my ex who is the only one who knows about my depression and suicidal thoughts, told her i fear i might not make it till next week. Since she is at this big end of the school year party she told me not to talk to her about this as she doesn't want her night ruined, and then literally told me to 'go see a psychologist'. Can't believe the only person i've ever trusted in enough to let her know about my condition just let go of me like that. Part of me wants to kill myself to go out with a big fuck you, the part of me that wants to keep going is slowly dying.
