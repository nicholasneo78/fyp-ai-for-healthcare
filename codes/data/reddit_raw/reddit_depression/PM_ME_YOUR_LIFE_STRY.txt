I just feel trapped
I'm finishing up my Masters degree and just feel hopeless right now. I hate school. I'm starting to hate my field of study too. I play the trumpet. But to be honest, I'm not very good at it. High notes, any other trumpet player will be able to understand. In the past two years, my playing has underwent some other terrible thing where I hesitate at the start of anything I play. It's 100 percent mental. I've made some strides in it, but it still comes back. For the past two years, it has made me feel like I can't even play a simple fucking melody to someone if asked. Trumpet is basically my adventure, but it seems like I just cause myself pain. I want to keep working on it, but boy it hurts my soul to suck and to keep not doing well. On top of that, I struggle with my weight. I love fast food. I know it's bad, but I use it to cope. I also would love to stop watching porn. I'm addicted to that. I've been addicted to that since I was probably in the 4th grade. I just feel trapped, like I don't have the self control or am not smart enough to discipline myself to fix these problems. I'm just sick of being a loser in life. Is there any hope?
