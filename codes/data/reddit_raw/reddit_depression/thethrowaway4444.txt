Opening up to people is a waste of time.
Fuck this shit. I'm never opening up or talking about my feeling ever again. I'll just let them die with me. No one understands. No one cares. Everyone critisises you. I'll let them stay inside me and fucking go crazy. I'll never ever tell anyone what I'm feeling and my problems ever again.
