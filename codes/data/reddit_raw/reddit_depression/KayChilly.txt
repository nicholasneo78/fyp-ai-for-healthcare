I don’t know what to do anymore.
I’m so tired of my doctor telling me there will be a perfect medication.  I’m so tired of trying and it not working. I’m just...tired.  I feel like I’m not good enough and I have a hard time trying to just get out of bed everyday.  I just want to be happy. My current meds just make me feel angry. I don’t know what’s worse...  we are going to try something new and I pray it works.. I am not doing enough for my family and my therapist just says keep trying and she knows I can push out of the bad places but I just don’t have the energy to keep fighting it on my own anymore.
