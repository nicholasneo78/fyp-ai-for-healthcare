I hate my boring, routine life. I’m accomplishing nothing, I’m not living. I’m simply existing.
I am so sick of getting up and working 9-5 five days a week. My job stresses me out so much that I can’t unwind and relax in the few hours I have to myself a day, my weekends are full of errands that I can’t do during the week because of working, I have no hobbies and I have no energy in any free time I have to start some. I don’t make enough money to really have any experiences, I’m so bored. I can’t take time off work even though I have PTO because the amount of work I have to catch up on even missing one day is unreal and it stresses me out more to miss work than it does to be there. 

I am so sick of this cyclical life. I hate being told I have to spend 1/3 of my life at a job. How does anyone get over this?
