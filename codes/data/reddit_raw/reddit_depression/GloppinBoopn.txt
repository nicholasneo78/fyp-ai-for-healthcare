Who even cares anymore
I’ve just learned to accept my thought and I realise things aren’t gonna get better.I have the same cycle every day just play video games mourn for death wish I had weed and listen to sad songs till the morning life has just become such a boring shit show. Even talking to random people has me fucked up cause i fuck things up tell me guys what’s the point of even living anymore
