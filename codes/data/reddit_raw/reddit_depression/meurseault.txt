No friends whatsoever. Living in isolation. Please help me
I'm in my final semester of undergrad. I'm 24. I live in a university apartment. I have severe social anxiety. I've gone through therapy before, stopped for a while, and am now trying to find a new therapist that takes my insurance. 

Every day is almost total isolation. I go to class. I fantasize about working up the courage to talk to someone or say something in class but never do. I go back to my apartment. My randomly assigned roommates, all several years younger than me, keep to themselves. I am too afraid to talk to them. So I hole up in my small room and play video games or do homework. Day in. Day out. Rinse. Repeat. This has been my life for several years now. 

I'm incredibly insecure. I have some combination of body dysmorphia and an eating disorder. I'm probably quite good looking but I've never been in a relationship; I'm still a kissless virgin. This eats me alive and makes me afraid to talk to women. Another reason to isolate further.

I'm losing touch with reality. I have loving parents but their advice isn't particularly helpful. What I want is a friend, someone to talk to--but the anxiety gets in the way. I can talk to people in a structured setting, like therapy, or online (and easily and freely at that). But it's the act of doing it in the real world, in a natural setting, that is just impossible. 

I fantasize a lot about killing myself though I don't think I could ever actually carry it out. If someone could just be there for me I'd feel better. But I've given up almost all hope.
