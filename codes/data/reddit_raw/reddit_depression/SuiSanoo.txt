Can/Should I send her a dm?
Hi 

I‘ll start this with some backstory. A friend of mine plays in a band and last weekend I watched them live for the first time, it was pretty small with four other bands and maybe 15 people watched my friends band. 
Anyway their lead singer is a girl who gave some weird vibes while on stage, but she was also very edgy so maybe it was that. 
After the concert someone showed me her IG and I thought I‘d follow her. She and approved me and followed back. The first post she made after that was pretty much this summarized:
I am having a pretty bad phase of depression right now. I have no motivation, cant take compliments serious, hate everything I do and am overwhelmed with the smallest social interactions (there was more but I‘ll stop here). 

I personally have been struggling for the past few weeks with similar issues again and thought if it was okay to send her a message along the lines of this or if it would be intrusive:

Hey I saw your Post about your depression and can relate a lot to yo. I am a friend of guy and saw you live for the first time in city. 
I know how shit it feels to have phases like this and won’t say it becomes magically better, but you are doing an amazing job with your music. 
I know you don’t know me and I don’t know you, but if you want to talk to someone who comprehend what you are feeling, I would gladly do it.  

English isn’t my first language so some things might sound rough, but I hope I was able to get my message across
