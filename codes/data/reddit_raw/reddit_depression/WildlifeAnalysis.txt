I feel doubts about my relationship when I'm depressed?
I'm 25/M. I'm gay and I've been with my boyfriend J for five months.

I used to be severely depressed. But lately my life has been pretty good. But sometimes I get into a depressed mood and I start having doubts about my relationship.

Honestly nothing is really wrong between us. But sometimes I feel like I don't really love him, and that we don't actually have any chemistry. And I don't know why I feel that way. I start nitpicking our relationship and try to find flaws in it to justify how I feel.

But other times we'll both be in a good mood, and the spark is totally there, and I feel great about everything.

I'm starting to think that this is just what my brain defaults to when I'm sad, and that there's nothing actually wrong with us. For example this weekend I was feeling great, then on Sunday my parents had a conversation with me that really triggered me, and now I'm feeling depressed and doubting my relationship. (The conversation with my parents had nothing to do with my boyfriend.)

Basically it seems like whenever I feel down, my brain immediately jumps to "maybe I should break up with my boyfriend." I don't know if this is a sign that something is actually wrong, or if this is just what a depressed brain does. 

Does anyone else experience this? Is this common?
