I’ve come undone
I’m constantly tired, lack care for anything and suicidal thoughts rush through my head almost everyday. My depression is negatively impacting my relationship. She understands what I’m going through and try’s to be supportive, but I constantly make actions that push her away. I enjoy hanging out in groups so I can just fade away without anyone really noticing to much (compared to one on one). I really can’t live like this. Things are far from the worst they’ve been but i can feel things sinking and sinking. When I feel things going up it just ends up sinking further.
