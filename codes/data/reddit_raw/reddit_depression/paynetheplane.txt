Back to square 1
Depression sucks. I have Been depressed for longer than I could remember. Some days are okay, I could manage to get out of bed and go out. Some days I just want to shut myself in my bedroom, lying on my bed. And then I feel useless and ruminate over the fact that I am in fact useless. Today I feel like absolute shit because the weather sucks. No I am not going out of my home. I don't care if I am running out of food in my apt. I am forgetting all the advice by therapist and wiping out all the progress I have made. I am back to square one. 
I am such a useless existence on the earth
