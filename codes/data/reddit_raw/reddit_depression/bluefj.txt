Finally on the path to getting myself back.
I had a really bad panic attack last night that came out of nowhere and it enabled me to visit my doctor today and talk about my depression. She gave me some prescriptions and referred me to several therapists.

I'm finally going to start taking meds so hopefully in about a month I'll start getting my life back. Hell even if these particular meds don't agree with my system, just the fact that I've taken my first steps in my journey is enough hope for me!
