"You don't have it bad enough"/"You only think about yourself"
Got into a discussion with my SO because of my depression/anxiety. They told me I don’t have it bad enough and if I were worse off I’d get my shit together. So something in me snaps and I admit I’d actually rather be dead (whoops). This leads to them telling me I’m only thinking about myself and asking me how I believe they feel when I tell them I want to die. 

Anyone else got to hear stuff like this?
