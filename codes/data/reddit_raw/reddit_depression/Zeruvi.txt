"I don't wanna die, but I ain't keen on livin' either."
Sorry for the Robbie lyric. I just want to vocalize a bit before the rare fancy passes and I go back to soldiering on alone. I'm sorry if this rambles or doesn't quite make sense, but if I leave the stream of consciousness or reread I will probably delete because I loathe the idea of complaining to others or whinging knowing full well I've probably got it better than most people here. But a part of me wants to know that someone else experiences depression the same way, as some small solace.  
  
I'm never particularly sad, nor do I hate or wish harm upon myself or my life or the people in it. However, in every waking moment I have a weight emanating from my core, like a gravitational pull sucking in my ability to want anything meaningful.  
  
The best way I can put it is in the title - I simply don't want to *be*. And that's not because I'm overwhelmed by hardship or struggle, I've got it pretty good and there's nowhere I'd rather be. If, hypothetically, you took me back to before my birth and laid out an incredible life for me and said "alright, you're about to be born, ready to go?" I'd say "no thanks, I'm good".  
  
With a core belief like that there's no life to live. Career advancement serves no purpose but to consume more time, and I'd be taking a good job from someone who actually gets some personal value out of it. Romance is off the cards because someone who wants to date someone who doesn't want anything from life, probably also isn't worth being with. And heaven forbid someone should want kids! Hey Junior, daddy doesn't like his existence but he had you anyway, what an asshole. 
  
I should stop before I become some combination of "old man yells at cloud" and "whiny emo stereotype". This stuff sits on me every day and I wish the small part of me that wants the affirmation of others wasn't there. But it is, so here I am.
