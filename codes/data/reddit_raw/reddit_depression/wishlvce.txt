Feel as though I’m losing myself and everything in life is pointless
I’m 21 and I’ve hit a wall in my life where I feel like relationships and life in general is just pointless. I’m a slave to debt. I have no career going for me and I don’t know what career path I want to go towards. All of this has just built up inside me and I just feel like giving up. We’re expected to go to school, work, get married, have kids, work until you die. I haven’t found a passion in really anything work related and I don’t think I ever will. I’m in a relationship but I feel as though I’m being self destructive in this relationship and maybe this relationship is dying out soon, idk and idk how I would cope with that. I’m just so lost and I haven’t talked to anyone about this because I don’t have the patience and time for people making excuses for me. If someone could relate and share, that would help.
