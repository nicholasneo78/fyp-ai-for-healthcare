I'm tired of forcing myself to do things.
Maybe it's me being lazy. Maybe it's my undiagnosed ADHD.

I don't know. 

All I know is that I hate not being able to enjoy almost *anything*. 

I just feel so numb and dull. I dropped almost all of my friendships with people who are not in my workplace. Haven't had the motivation to talk to anyone. It just feels like a chore to me. Socializing is torturous and I get bored very quick. I can't seem to focus on any conversation. 

I hate forcing myself to do the most simple things, like: taking a shower, putting on makeup, cooking, cleaning, even playing videogames. I'm a huge WoW nerd, so I should be excited for the new patch and game. But, I'm not. I got amped up when I saw the trailer, but now, I rather not play it. I rather not play anything. Just recently, I forced myself to play Bioshock again. It's been years since I visited Rapture. I *love* Rapture. But why is it so boring to play? I used to have so much fun...

How do you get out of this funk? I don't want to feel like this and it is ruining my life. Not to mention, my SO and I haven't been doing well because of it. I just feel...nothing. I need help, but I don't want a therapist or any new diet plans. None of that copypaste bullshit. What *actually* works? 

Also, I forgot to mention that I smoke weed daily. I heard that it can make depression worse and I've been using it for almost two years now. Is this something I should only do at night? I originally used it for sleep.
