I feel like depression has turned my brain into mush and now I can’t be successful in anything
Last year I stopped being productive at work and it’s now seeping into the rest of my life. I used to receive accolades for being great at my job. I was even at the top in the nation at my job when they looked at my metrics and sales. But now I’m just sad all of the time and I can’t think straight. 

Every morning I wake up I start the day ready to take it on. I tell myself I’m going to be productive and make strides to complete goals. But then I can’t bring myself to do anything. There are days where I can sit at my desk for hours just thinking about how I should be working on something. But then when I try, it’s like I can’t think straight. The things I used to be good at now don’t really seem to make sense to me. I feel like my brain is literally turning into mush. 

I started seeing a therapist, I started taking anti depressants, I exercised for awhile, I tried meditating, I feel like I’m trying everting in my power to get me mind right. But my brain is mush and now I can’t be successful in anything I do. School is starting to slip and my friends keep asking why they never see me.

My SO keeps telling me to “take small steps” but that’s what I’ve been doing for a year now. It’s not working. I’m stuck in a cycle of waned to be better and “woe is me”.
