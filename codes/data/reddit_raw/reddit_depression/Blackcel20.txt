I'm gonna die a virgin. No one likes me and I have no friends.
My masculinity, self-esteem, and sense of self-worth have been destroyed thoroughly and are simply nonexistent anymore. I don't even bother trying anymore, I just wallow in my own sadness and escapist entertainment trying to find a reason to continue living with the fact that I'm worthless. No woman would ever be into me and I'm gonna die a virgin. I can't even find solace in masturbation because whenever I see any sort of porn I go deep into a depression again because seeing two people enjoying each other makes me envious. I have no friends and now I don't think I can make any.

I can't make friends with people I don't know how to do anything right man.
