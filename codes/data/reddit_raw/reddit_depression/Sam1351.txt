Friends
Im in year 10 and i already feel like a failure. My friends never invite me out with them and recently ive felt like ive not even been wanted to hang out with them at break time and lunchtime. all they do is take the piss out of me and no one else. I have one good friend and who i trust but thats it. I just want someone i can talk to who understands
