Coming to terms with life long depression
It's always going to be there in my life, like a dark cloud creeping in on a sunny day, and I'm okay with that. After 7 long years of battling depression and going through the highs and lows that come with it and after dedicating myself to therapy, medication and lifestyle changes I have finally accepted that I am going to have to learn to live with depression for the rest of my life. It's my strength, it's my weakness and it makes my life unique.
