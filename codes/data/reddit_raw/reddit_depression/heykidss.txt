I don't act depressed so people just think I'm edgyâ„¢
I'm pretty good at keeping up appearances in public but I do make the occasional depression joke, so when I tell those jokes or share a meme about suicide people think I'm making light of depression or laughing at suicidal people. But honestly I can't remember the last time I went a day without wanting to kill myself haha. But then again you can't really reach out to anyone without being that "depressing friend" and the college therapist is pretty shit so here I ammmmmmmm
