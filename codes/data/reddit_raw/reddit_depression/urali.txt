I got really drunk and talked to myself for 5 hours straight sitting alone in a dark kitchen. It felt good.
It sounds crazy, but i felt so relieved, i literally started saying everything i ever wanted to say, about depression, world, society, about my suicide attempts, dissapointments, dreams, pain, everything i ever wanted to say. I think im going insane.
