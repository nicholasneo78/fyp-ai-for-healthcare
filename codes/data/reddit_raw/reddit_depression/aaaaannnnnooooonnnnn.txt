Humiliated and feeling like a disappointment
When people see me out, I feel so humiliated. I have to make up some bullshit story  about “taking a gap year before I embark on a career” when really I wanna say “well karen I’m clinically depressed as fuck and worn down to the bone by my own thoughts so thought I should put my life on hold” but no one wants to hear that shit. 

I’m trying to block out  but it’s so hard. I can’t see an end to this, nothing excites me that much anymore and the thought of getting a proper career job terrifies me. I just want this feeling to stop, I can’t take it anymore
