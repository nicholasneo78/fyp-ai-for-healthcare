Sometimes I wonder if I’m just a lazy fuck and not depressed at all
My dad just scolded me over the phone because I was still in bed and its 2PM. My parents has been very nice and understanding since I told them about my depression. But when he said something along the lines of”no one stays in bed all day, everybody has to get up, you have friends who take the bus to work and work all night long. Why should you get special treatment? The only one who can change how you feel is you. And if you want to feel better you can’t play games all night and sleep all day”

I’m still in bed, haven’t eaten anything, haven’t done the dishes like I promised i would, haven’t cleaned my room. I’m worthless.
