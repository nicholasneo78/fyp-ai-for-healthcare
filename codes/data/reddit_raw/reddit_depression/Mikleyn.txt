I’m having suicidal thoughts
He chose someone else over me again. How can someone be so heartless? He had no concern for my feelings. He just cut me out of his life by saying he never loved me and wanted to be with someone else. How do you recover from that? I’m so angry. It has gotten to the point of me having suicidal thoughts. That’s not the route I want to take because I am a mother, but it’s getting hard to cope. Help
