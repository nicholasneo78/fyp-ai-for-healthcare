I have gone days without talking to anyone
I just got out of a bad relationship recently. But I have a issue with dependancy. I let him dictate my entire life. I let him into my head to the point I feel brainwashed. I hate everyone. I don't trust anyone. I don't want to talk to anyone because I know he will get mad and be jealous. He is the closest and only person I have in my life and even though we broke up he wants us to remain best friends. We dated for 2 years and it was Rocky the entire time. But I let him get his hooks into me and I can't get out. I am terrified to not have him in my life because then I will be truly alone. I don't talk to anyone else. I am 26 years old and I have 0 friends other then him. I am terrified of being alone. But he is seeing someone else now. She is 100 times better then me in every way. She is super model gorgeous and everything that me and him shared she has as well. I feel replaced. But I don't want to not be his friend and not have him in my life. I'm terrified to lose him. I cling to the hope one day he will want me again. I haven't talked to another person in over a week. and if he is busy with her I don't talk to anyone at all. I just lay on my couch staring at the wall and having a constant never ending panic attack. I have sever depression and severe anxiety that I take medicine for both. But they only make the feelings bearable and don't take them away completely. I don't sleep. I just want to throw myself at every fuck boy on dating apps just to have some kind of physical attention even if it is only sex. Even if I am not attracted to them. I don't care. I just want someone to love me. I want someone to hold me and make me feel not alone. I don't know what to do. I feel like I've been kicked in the chest. It hurts to breathe. I made a noose and stood on a stool with it around my neck for over a hour the other night crying. But I couldn't do it. I don't know how to go on living.
