I have a bad personality that appears good.
My personality is a result of childhood abuse and depression. I was treated like a subordinate not worthy of shit growing up and now as an adult I'm a people pleaser to the extent of ruining my own life to help others even if they dont need it because I worry about my reputation and want people to constantly think I'm a really good person. I know that it isn't good behaviour but I don't know how to be outside of that. It feels nice to get praised for it but I really want to start accomplishing things for myself and let people handle their own business. I want to be someone. I don't even feel like a person half the time. There are too many ways to be and I don't know which one is a good fit for me. It's definitely not this. I'm not really sure what to do and I'm sure no one could really answer this for me but I really wanted to get it off my chest. Idk if anyone else is like this but it sucks. I was doing some research and found martyr syndrome and it really kicked me off my pedalstool and I feel like a piece of shit that sets too high standards and takes too much responsibility on and makes people feel bad. I thought I was just a super nice person but I'm actually an asshole victimizing myself constantly and blaming it on others.

TL;DR: I have a bad personality and I want to find a new one that is better.
