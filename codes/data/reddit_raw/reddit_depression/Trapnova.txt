No one wished me on my birthday
Yesterday was my birthday and none of my close friend wished me  except for my family members. I wish all my best friends at exactly 12:00 clock , video-calling  or texting whatever suits them. I normally avoid attention and don't care about such things but this really bugs me. They are the friends that I meet everyday and had expectations , just a acknowledgement would make me happy. I know this sounds like attention-seeking behaviour and I generally don't care about such things. I am happy in under my own skin but this makes me a bit sad
