My mother pt.2
I posted about my issues with my mother the other day, and I have discovered new information. She's been complaining to her boyfriend, and he has a busy mouth, so naturally he's spilled it all. I've learned that my mother never wanted me to move back in with her after I lost my apartment, and she's been saying she buys me lots of things: clothes, computers, etc. And I just toss them aside and never use them, because I'm an ungrateful child. So she just took the stuff and started wearing the clothes. None of that is true. What's probably going on here is that she's buying herself things, and using me as a scapegoat so she doesn't have to tell her boyfriend she has money, or bought things for herself. Or she's just delusional and making shit up. Maybe even that she's stealing clothes from me and covering that way. I could believe any of that. Either way, she wants me to leave, and I know she does. And that hurts like a mother. No pun intended. What I want to do is get custody of my younger brother, and leave the state. Just start over, and make sure my brother is raised in a safe and nurturing environment. Because I can't live with knowing that he's growing up in the same toxicity that I did, and how it'll fuck him up like it did me. She's two-facing everyone; talking shit to one person, then smiling to the person's face she just trashed. And if anyone tries to call her out, she gets pissed and plays dumb. Her sugar daddies have been showing up at the house. She does drugs on the daily. She's going to end up old, a lone, and with her kids and family hating her, no one coming to see her. I'm ready to disown her. It just hurts. Why is she like this? Why does it have to be this way? It hurts.
