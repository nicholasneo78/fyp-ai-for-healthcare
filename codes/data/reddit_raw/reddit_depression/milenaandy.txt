My boyfriend blocked me
I’ve been talking to him about my depression and my feelings, and he usually doesn’t offer the most support. Most of the time I just want someone to listen, maybe hold my hand and tell me everything will be okay. 

Well today, he blocked me. He blocked my phone number and he completely blocked me on all social media’s. All because he got tired of listening to me talk about how I feel. I told him today I wished I was dead and I felt all alone. And he blocked me. 
Maybe he really doesn’t care if something happened to me.
