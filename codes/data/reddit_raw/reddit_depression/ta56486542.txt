Most people on here seem to be so much more successful than I am
and i'm really happy for them! it's just that it makes me feel all the more worthless that i never had a job, a girlfriend/boyfriend, i don't even really have friends, and there's probably some other stuff but i cant remember it rn. sometimes i tend towards these goals bc i hope it'll make me happy, but there are so many people out here who are so successful, who "have their life together" when you have an outsider's take, but who still are not alright. really, what's the answer to life (that's rhetorical, i'm just venting, but thx for reading i guess).
