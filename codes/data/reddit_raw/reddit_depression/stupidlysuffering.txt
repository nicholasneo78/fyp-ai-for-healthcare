I'm drowning
I really can't breath. I'm drowning and can't see any chance of things getting better. I don't know how to open up to people. I don't know how to make things better. I've tried so many things to get myself out of this rut but I just can't. I really don't know what to do anymore I feel like i have lost all hope. I've been to a doctor before and got medication but I didn't want that to be the first solution. I guess I expected my doc to have the answer for me to get better. I didn't take the meds because the crazy side effects and again I only wanted to take them if I absolutely need them and the doc didn't even try anything else. So now I've hit a wall and I don't think it will get better. I want to die.
