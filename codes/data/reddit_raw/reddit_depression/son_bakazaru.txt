I need to sell/get rid of my gun
I am realizing that the only reason I haven't killed myself is because my dog loves me. My first marriage ended over 7 years ago because my wife choose someone else over me. My fiance can create her own schedule, and she chooses to go in late so that she comes home after I go to sleep. My friends are having kids and families, and I have my little dog Dixie. She's amazing. I helped rescue her after her owner passed away and I could never do that to her again. She's 11 now and loves me. I read a story online about a dog passing away and I thought "if little Dixie goes, I'll go too." And it took hours before I realized that I don't think I'm kidding. I work only so that bills get paid. I'll never pay off my student loan debt. If I go soon, my nephew won't have any memories of me. 


I'm crying on my couch. And I don't want to talk to anyone I know personally because they will try to tell me I have reasons to be happy, or my fiance will tell me that .... I don't know. I just need to not have an easy out sitting in my closet.
