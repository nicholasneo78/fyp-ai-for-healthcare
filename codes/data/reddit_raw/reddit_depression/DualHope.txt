Feeling ashamed of my depression...does anyone else feel like this?
I’ve been going through a really bad depressive episode and today at school someone said “ remember when you were all ‘sunshiney’ and happy and laughed all the time? You should go back to when you acted like that.” 

This makes me feel so ashamed of my depression and like I’m not reaching peoples expectations of how I should act. I don’t have the energy to hide that I’m not okay anymore...

Does this happen to anyone else?
