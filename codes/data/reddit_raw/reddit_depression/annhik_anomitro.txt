" I want someone to be afraid of losing me. No one has and I don't think no one ever will "
When I'm sad, I browse through sad lines/quotes. This came up, and I've been feeling this way for a long long time. I'm unwanted, nobody ever wanted me, nobody ever said that they need me in their life. I feel useless, I feel I don't matter. I don't mind being alone, I don't mind anything. It hurts though, knowing that I'll never get to know what it feels like to be loved, hugged or to be held by any one. It's  3am here, I can't sleep, I'm crying and this is how it's been for a very long time.
