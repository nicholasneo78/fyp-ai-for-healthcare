Realising your mental state and life is unfixable sucks
Just started to realise this. Been working my way to suicide last year but it didn't work out. 


So I'm trying my best (how ironic) to just feed myself everyday, and not letting my emotions burden the ones I love (or any person I come across). Basically just existing plainly.


I really wished I could show affection to those I love and care about. But I realise that without any qualities as a person, I'm better off just not being a nuisance and a liability.


Feeling lonely sucks. I wished I feel loved by those whom I love. But staying away (while not killing myself)  is my only way to protect them from myself.


Oh well. Thanks for listening.
