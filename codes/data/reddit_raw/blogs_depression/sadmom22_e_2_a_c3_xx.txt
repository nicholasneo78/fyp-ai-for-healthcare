I'm 22 years old, a proud mom of a beautiful little girl who's almost 2 and she is the only good thing in my life.  We live with my parents and that just makes me feel like such a failure, that I can't provide for my child.  I love her to death but she was an accident and I do wonder what it would be like if I didn't have that responsibility, I always tell myself that I'm sure lots of young single moms think that way as long as I'm there for her it's okay.  I've been seeing my neighbor for 8 months now, he's 9 years older then me and my daughter has grown attached to him and I am so in love with him. But I don't know what to do everything is so messed up with him and I, it just seems like he stopped caring and I feel like I'm not good enough for him, for anybody.  I don't have anyone I feel like I can talk to and this is all new to me so now I feel like I'm rambling on about stupid things when there are other people out there with worse problems then me, but I'm just so sad and don't know what to do....
