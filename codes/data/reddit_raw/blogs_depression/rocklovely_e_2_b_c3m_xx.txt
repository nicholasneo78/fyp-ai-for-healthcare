i'm new here, i'm 26 years old and i have been taking effexor for 4 years now. i have struggled with insomnia, and taken just about everything out there (trazadone, seroquil, lorazepam, clonazapam ...) i have been on remeron for a month now, 30 mg at night and i find it works well but i am worried about the side effects, particularly weight gain, i have noticed my appetite has increased, any tips? i hate to go off, since it actually works. i would appreciate any advice. also, my sex drive has become a big fat zero lately, and that is very odd for me. i am single right now, but i can't even imagine having sex with anyone including myself!! i've asked about wellbutrin, but was turned down by my doctor who didn't think it would be right for me. any thoughts?
