I am looking for someone to help me to understand if the way i feel is normal growing up or am i depressed?  It feels like my life is stuck in park and i really want it to start driving again, like i had always planned it would.  You see i'll be 28 soon and i still live at home with my mom (we get along great and she's my best friend) but i just can't afford to live on my own yet.  Fort Lauderdale is quite expensive ..... i just laid off from my job a month ago and have been working with my mom to make some money so i don't have to dip into savings, my boyfriend of almost 10 months is too busy for me it seems and i just feel like i am stuck ... he is the one for me, but i'm not sure he feels the same for me .... i've always wanted to get married and have the kids, but it looks like that will never happen and i feel so hopeless ....

 

not sure how these chat things work, so hopefully someone will read this and want to talk or just tell me this is normal feeling ....
