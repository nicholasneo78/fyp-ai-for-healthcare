I've suffered from depression episodes for about 10 years. Lately, due to major stresses at work, I'm back into feeling awful. I'm a good employee and have hidden my depression episodes well in the past but now I'm terrified that my new boss, whom I hate, will find out and fire me. I'm working double time to not be seen as weak and incompetent. I can't afford to get fired but am terrified that that my boss will use anything to get me fired. The stress of trying to be professional at all times at my job is just about killing me. It makes me so angry. When other employees have physical illness, such as cancer or heart problems my employer rallies around them and makes all sorts of accommodations but I've kept my depression a secret because I'm afraid it will be seen as a character flaw and I'll be fired. Plus I'm so paranoid, I'm sure when I come into work each day, I'll be escorted off the premises and I don't know what I'll do. Any advice from those of you who have been terrified of being discovered.
