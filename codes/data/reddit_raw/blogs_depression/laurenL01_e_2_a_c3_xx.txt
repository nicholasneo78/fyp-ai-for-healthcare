i know you wouldn't have guessed it by my name i am 18 i have recently become a paraplegic (paralyzed from the chest down) this is down to unbelievable circumstances misdiagnosed several times  misreading of  results and MRI scans i was in a relationship before the injury for 3 years with a lad similar age. i did sport and exercise science at college and was a well known sports person for several different sports. As well as losing the use of my legs and other bodily functions, my boyfriend cheated on me whilst seriously ill i now feel highly vulnerable and lost as my whole life as i once new it has been taken away not only this but my mom within in herself has so much to cope with as well as watching the pain i go through i nearly died 4 times including boxing day and christmas day. i am lucky in the fact i have plenty of friends and family which support me the only problem is no one understands i have always been very strong minded and kept my chin up and  a smile recently as my 18th birthday has just passed i have realized what i have lost, and how i have 2 sit and watch all my friends getting on with life the doctor is always advising me to take my tablets and antidepressants but i choose not to. Although by reading this you will not be able to see how much i have to deal with. i feel as though i am becoming a burden to my family and i really feel i need someone unrelated to my social surroundings to give me a small nudge back to feeling more like myself. i have always had boyfriends before my injury but now it is impossible for me to see myself with anybody again. Due to the fact using the unfortunate words i am now a wheelchair user. can someone please help me.
