I have been on 50 mg of Zoloft for 6 months now, and I have the worst night sweats!!!  I haven't had any other side effects from it other than the night sweats, but this side effect is enough!  I get them about every other week and they last for 4 - 5 days.  Sometimes it is so bad that I wake up 3 times a night to change my clothes because I am drenched! 
I just wanted to know if anyone else has had the same experience?  I'm thinking of getting some blood work done to rule out anything else even though my doctor says that it is definitely caused from the Zoloft since I never had this problem before!
