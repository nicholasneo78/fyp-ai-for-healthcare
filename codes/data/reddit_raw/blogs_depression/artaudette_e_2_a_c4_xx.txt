I'm new here - left an introductory ramble in the appropriate section.

I've been depressed (both clinically recognized or otherwise) for around 15 years (I'm 20 for the record).

After 3 - 4 months of a "good" period I'm finding that I'm slipping back into that "black hole".

I'm looking for support and very happy to offer everyone all I have to help, even if it's little.

I haven't been to a therapist in 2 years and I've not been on medication steadily for an even longer while (although I think I needed both in the meantime save for the past few "happy" months).

Anyway - take care everyone.

I know I'm new here but if anyone feels like they're cracking up, feel free to PM me. I'm used to the unpleasant ride depression gives people.
