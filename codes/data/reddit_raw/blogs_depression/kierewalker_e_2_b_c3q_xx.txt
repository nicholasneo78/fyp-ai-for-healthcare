I've basically been living a lie for the last year.  My depression / social anxiety has become so crippling that I'm scared to work outside of the home, but I told my parents that I was working anyway, because I didn't want them to know how bad it was.  I wasn't taking money from them or anything (I don't live with my parents, and my husband has a great job and I don't technically HAVE to work)  but now that I've come clean about it my mother says she feels "manipulated."  I guess I can see why, and I do feel really bad about lying to them.  I suppose that their forgiveness will just take time.  But the thing is, I can't tell any of them HOW BAD THIS REALLY IS, including my husband.  It's to the point now where I'm even afraid to see a doctor.  I'm sure there isn't some magic formula for getting past actually having to admit that you have a really serious problem,  but I was just wondering how some of you were able to get past that feeling of embarrassment and shame that keeps you from getting help, and telling the people you love the truth.   Every day is getting harder and harder, especially now that my family knows I've been lying.  I really thought telling them would make everything a little easier (lying = instant paranoia!), but now I can't stop thinking about how I've ruined my relationships with them forever, and I'm even more hopeless than I was before.  How can I get past this embarrassment?
