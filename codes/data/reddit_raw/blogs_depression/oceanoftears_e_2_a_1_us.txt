I had really bad anxiety attacks/panic attacks when I am on the first couple days of my period. I mean bad... to the point of having to stay home from school for 2-3 days. I would be in so much pain and extremely depressed and so many other symptoms. I found that when I got on birth control... around 5 months on it, they stopped being so horrible. I do still have to watch my diet around the time though... my blood sugar gets extremely low and I pass out and shake a lot. I'd say maybe talk to your doctor about birth control... it was a lifesaver for me. I just wanted to rip my danged uterus out!
