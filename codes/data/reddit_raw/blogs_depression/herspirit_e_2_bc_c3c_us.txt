Help!
I just want to cut, and cut, and cut.  It feels so good.  So far I have managed to maintain some sort of self control and only cut my wrist and genitalia.  I'm afraid because I have the whole weekend to myself except for a few things I'm doing with friends.  My mind is full of strange thoughts.  I'm sorry I was so descriptive.  I really would like it if someone would respond.  I'm not seeing my therapist until Wednesday and I got into a big fight with my husband on Friday about my depression.  He said I make him depressed.  He doesn't know how to handle me.  He thinks that depression is a choice not a disease.  He wants me to talk to him about my problems like I talk to my therapist. I can't.  He says things like I throw him a guilt trip.  He is one of my problems.  He damages my self -esteem.
