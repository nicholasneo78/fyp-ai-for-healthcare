Isn't love great? When my daughter was younger she wanted to marriage her daddy of course (doesn't all little girls want to do that). Before she started school, when she was in daycare centre, she had like 5 boys or so she was "dating". After that she has not mentioned anything about boys being pretty or so in school, until....she married our rabbit! lmao. Yes you heard me, she had a couple of friends here and they had a wedding ceremony. I guess she got tired of it cause after that she likes somebody new. Like every girl in her age she fell in love with a famous one, a singer. (When i was her age i was in love with a hockey player but that's a different story).This is him: Darin!. Was in Swedish Idol. Psstt, she's over him now. My daughter is so cute i love you :)
