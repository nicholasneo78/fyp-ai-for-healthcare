Hi, this is my first time posting a reply to something (besides the welcome new member forum). I feel uncomfortable replying to someone else when I don't feel like I have anything helpful to say, but I really need to get some stuff out, so I'll start here. I am staying at my parents' house right now for winter break (I am in college). I really wanted to come home but now that I'm here I think it was stupid of me to want to come home. Being at home with no one but my parents to talk to only fuels my depression. My dad is the worst. I feel like he's always judging me, and I'm a disappointment to him. I feel lazy and immature. I only have a few friends left here in my hometown, and I barely talk to them. The friend who I am closest to got a new boyfriend about a week ago, so she won't want to just hang out with me so much. And I understand that. The friends I am not so close to anymre, it is awkward talking to them. it always just goes back to high-school. So I am stuck home all day and I don't feel like doing anything but watching TV and sleeping. I feel awful. There is so much more that I could say but I'll leave it for another post.
