When I was 10, my babysitter molested me many times over the course of 1 year. Many of the times she would make me dress up in girl's clothes and she would take me out that way. I'm 30 now. I still can't have sex. I still can't go out into public without having severe anxiety attacks. And when I'm at home, I find myself cross dressing sometimes.
The shrinks with whom I've spoken have never been helpful so I'm hoping this post finds someone who may have some idea of what I went through and am going through now.
Please write if you have any ideas to share.
