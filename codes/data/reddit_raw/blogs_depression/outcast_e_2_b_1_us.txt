Here's my answer to your age question. Sadly, I am 29 years old: sniffle1: Don't get me wrong. I don't want to be completely alone for the rest of my life. There's a sentimental part of me that yearns for companionship with a guy, but I have such a tall hurdle to overcome before I can even get to that yet. Yeah, but I can relate to the peace and quiet thing by myself. It really is such a luxury nowadays (personally speaking). One thing I reflected on was that I live in a family of 8 people, and maybe that's why I feel so claustrophobic and irritable around lots of people. Essentially, there's no secure privacy, really. Yup, like you I used to live independently when I went to school. I'm on a bit of a break right now, but will go back in September where I'll share an apartment with a roommate I don't know. Right now, I'm mooching off my parents' food and shelter. At age 29, I feel like a little child. And by the way, I'm unemployed too. I tried all summer to land a job, but in vain. I only worked one day for Elections Canada, and that was it. Oh well, a paycheck is a paycheck, right? The thing is, I can't stand living with somebody I hardly know either. Sometimes I just don't want to greet somebody at breakfast, or say a polite 'hello, how are you, or how was your day?". When I battle depression and social anxiety, I really really need the comfort of familiar people around me at times. The last thing I need is a complete stranger sharing my quarters. But, it's something I can't help. I'll probably isolate myself in my room for a while. At least I get cable TV and the internet. Then again, I'll probably become a complete hermit during the school year.
