Hi, I am Ellen a.k.a. Froggie girl62, a 43-year-old female who has been depressed for life. I have been labeled as having dysthymia in the past. Although it was never officially shared with me, I believe from what I have read that I was depressed even as a child. I graduated college the first time in 1985 with a BA in Sociology with Medical Emphasis and have worked in the medical transcription field for 19 years. I have become bored with the job and dissatisfied with being forced to work from home. (Majorly boring!) Last year I started going back to school to pursue a Masters in Fine Arts in Graphic Design. This has been a huge challenge since I am brand new in the art field and most of the other students are already artists. In addition, I MUST work 40 hours a week to maintain my health insurance benefits. My mom has been my best friend and support person forever and now she has been diagnosed with lung cancer. She had surgery 2 months ago and just began chemotherapy last week. I have had an awful time dealing with this. Although she has been given a fairly decent prognosis, I am scared that she is going to leave me and would trade places with her in flash if I could. Truthfully I am disappointed every day when I wake up. I save lots of money on products to remove mascara, as the tears usually do the job. I had been on Zoloft 25 mg since the late 1990s and my family doctor increased it first to 50 and now to 100 mg. I have also started seeing a psychiatrist, only 2 sessions so far, so hard to say much about that. In the past when I went for counseling, they just gave me silly assignments and told me to go out and meet people. With my school work, I have enough assignments already. I found this forum from a post on another support forum.
