Oh yeah!!! I am 52, perimenopausal and on EffexorXR and the occasional chlorazapate. I could NOT figure out why all of a sudden I was feeling so much worse shaky, can't sleep/want to sleep all the time. Then a ping went off in my head and I went "Duh!" I had stopped taking the hormones 5 weeks ago and have been in a gradual downward spiral since. It just didn't get bad or noticeable till last weekend. Called my GYN and told her the hormone reduction experiment was a total failure. I'm going for a new hormone today. I have heard that very low dose BC pills can help if the PMDD gets really bad.
