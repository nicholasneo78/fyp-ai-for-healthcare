Hello Tommy! to DF! I'm glad you joined! This board is a great place for information and support. Take your time browsing through the topics. I'm sure there will be lots of things you can relate to. When you feel comfortable enough, feel free to share any of your thoughts, questions, concerns, experiences, etc...Congrats on taking your first steps towards recovery! I think it takes a lot of courage to start treatment. I know it took me quite a while to admit to myself I couldn't handle my situation on my own any longer. I think you did great starting on both talk therapy and medicines! I hope you find therapy useful and that you and your therapist can work towards better skills to cope with the stressors in your life. Concerning your medication. There's a room dedicated to your antidepressant Prozac. You'll find lots of information there. Check it out sometime. One of the downsides of antidepressants is the fact that it takes a while for them to kick in. You only started about 10 days ago so you'll have to give the Prozac some time to be able to fully benefit from it. Meanwhile I hope you're not having too many side effects! Tom, thanks for joining. Keep us posted on how you're doing! Take good care of yourself!
