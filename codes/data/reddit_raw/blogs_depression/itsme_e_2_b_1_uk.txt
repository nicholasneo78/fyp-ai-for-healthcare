Hi i am a 34 mum of 5 kids i had severe postnatal depression 8years ago and was sent to a "special hospital"(that's what my kids call it ciz it helped mummy get better) for a week. i was on depressants 4 nearly 4 years . I've just divorced kids' dad after 16years and moved house ab find myself back on the tabs in the 3 weeks I've been seeing my doctor they've changed my tabs twice and just updated them so now I'm on double dose of them both. i also see a counselor. I'm due for my second visit soon and i also have to see a counselor from the "special hospital"...I've been seeing this guy ,an this weekend i sort of told him i don't want to see him no more as he only wants to see me at the weekends as he lives in dif town from me n has his own issues so he moving back to his hometown ...now i need the support of him he thinks he can still give me the support i need even though he miles away ... thing that scares me is every time my kids shout at each other i find i start shaking from the stomach then my hole body starts if i try to stop it it becomes worse to the extent when i was driving this morning my leg was visibly shaking an my son asked why i was ..i find i cry at the most silliest things e.g. if one my boys offers to make me a drink or to stuff that wouldn't bother me ... i could go on but i wont bore u now I'm at a lost as i told some of my family what's going on but i feel a failure an helpless as i cant be strong for the kids the kids go away for a week with there dad soon so i have that to look 4ward to but I'm scared 4 when they come back just incase i don't want them people tell me not to be silly because it won't happen like that ...everything i look at or feel is all negative or i think the worse of everything or everyone. I'm getting the help i need b4 it got to bad and i ended going back to "special hosp" but i feel as though i shouldn't be feeling like this an cant find ways of stopping it... as i said to people all i want is a big black hole to open up an let me out when i FEEL ready
