(I am 39) I say this to myself all the time, SJW...I never thought I would be in this position....but I am...and so are you...I can relate to you on many levels. If I did not work for my father I am sure I would be unemployed...due to my concentration problems, ATTENDANCE problems, uneven mood and unpredictable production level...so I am very lucky. I can see what challenges you face. I often thought that I might like to go into some sort of counseling because of my life experiences also. Do you live in a big enough city that you can apply at some mental health clinics or government aid departments? Sometimes the willingness to do that kind of work can get you in the door. It may be entry level, but you could work up if it were a job that satisfied your needs. What about like an activity director at a youth home, or a retirement village/senior home, or a special needs program? Here our recreation commission has a special populations program that coordinates trips and activities for the special population of the area. They go on ski trips and day trips and it looks very fun! Of course it takes a certain frame of mind to be able to work with the special population of the world. But I just mention it because you talked about counseling... I just wanted to clarify that although I am very lucky to have an income, it really fuels my depression sometimes to think about "how I am letting my dad down" or causing him extra crap to deal with...so lucky and not so lucky.
