I'm new here. I had been having a lot of problems with anxiety/depression and that was affecting my job a lot. I went out of work for a week hoping that maybe that would help. I felt like I was doing ok and that the relaxing was really helping but the night before I was supposed to go back to work it all happened again. So I pretty much came to the realization that I can't do it without medicines. Is this normal to think you are ok and then have it happen again?? And also, have any of you had your jobs affected by it?
