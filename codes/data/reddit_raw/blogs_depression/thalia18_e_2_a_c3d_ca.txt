I feel like a bit of a jerk posting here when I haven't been around to support any of you, so I hope someone out there is feeling generous tonight.

My background story consists on being depressed on and off for the past 12 years or so, I am now 20. Finally started antidepressants in October. By December the side effects were not stopping and I stopped taking them because I always felt sick to my stomach .... and a person can't work that way. So I stopped them .... I have not been to the doctor since and have been feeling on top of the world.

Even my co-workers have noticed a big difference and my manager has been giving me a lot of opportunity at work (training new hires, being on committees etc)

But ....

then today hit,. like a ton of bricks to the head.

I'm tired, cranky, I cant stop crying and am trying very hard not to cut myself. I hate everything and am just beside myself.  I don't know what to do. I have the energy from when i felt great but I feel like crud and have no where to constructively place this energy.

I don't think I can go back to my doctor ..... she'll just tell me to take the drugs and stop whining.

I'm not so sure I'm depressed. Maybe I'm normal and it's the rest of the world messed up? That's a whole other story though.

Can anyone here honestly say that medications work and you can be a functional person? I mean ... will this ever end so I can get some peace?

Any opinions or insight would be appreciated.
