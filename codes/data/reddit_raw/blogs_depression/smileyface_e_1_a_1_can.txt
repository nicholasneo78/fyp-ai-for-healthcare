Hello, i am a 24 year old male. this is my 3rd time joining this forum... i joined once, had to resign in because it moved form .com to .org (or something) then i took medicines, was feeling better and kind of stopped coming here... now i feel bad again. :( i think this forum is a great resource... the people who started it should be quite proud of themselves... if i started something that touched this many people, at the mindsets that were at... maybe i wouldn't be depressed anymore. my 1 complaint, as i have mentioned b4... i think it is wrong to make people post 5 times b4 they are allowed  to create a thread... when people are here, feeling depressed, sometimes, (i would assume) suicidal... they should be allowed to post new threads right away. However, i don't mean to complain, as i do feel this is a great resource, and it's more then I've done to help the less fortunate in the world... good luck everyone.
