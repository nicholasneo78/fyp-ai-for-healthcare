Okay so I'm doing a really shitty job of keeping up with this journal. So Sam came and went. Not before I went to a wedding and got drunk and told her parents that I was in love with her . Yea.. umm.. I'm gay. I then told her that I thought moving to Oregon was a bad bad idea. Not because I was in love with her but because moving to a city for a boy that you're in love with but has no interest in you. Not such a good idea. so anyways that made things all fucked up and she left and we weren't on the best terms  besides that the roommate thing just kind of fell apart. I didn't get the apartment across from shaye because of credit issues. So now I'm going to just move into her place. We'll see how that turns out... If we kill each other or not. I'm not on the lease so if it sucks I can just move out Â… there are a few boys that are into me. However I don't think that my soul really wants to be with anyone right now. I have something wrong with my heart  I'm doing blood work on Monday to figure out what's going on. And I took last week off for no reason at all. So I guess a lot has happened in the last 15 days. I should really try to keep up with this journal.
