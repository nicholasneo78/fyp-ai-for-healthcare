I have dealt with depression since I was about 12 years old and am now 26. I can tell that it is getting worse again and feel as if I am losing the battle. I feel as if I have no where to turn. My medication is not working the best and I am at the max dosage. I do not want to start over with another med and all the side effects. I am hoping that it will get better soon. I do the best I can. I have a husband and 2 children. My husband tries but does not really understand depression. We have talked about it some but does not seem to help much. I was hoping someone might have some advice for me.
