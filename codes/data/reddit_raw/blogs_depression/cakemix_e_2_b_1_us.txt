I would love to talk about dreams. Only thing is for every dream, there can be a hundred interpretations. Or so has been my experience. I always say that I will keep paper and pen next to me at night, so when I have a dream I want to remember (like last night)... I'll write it down so I won't forget. But I don't do this because when I wake up I think I can remember...no problem! After all, a lot of these dreams are so profound that how could I possibly forget them... guess what??? I almost always forget the words that meant so much to me in the dream. I remember the subject matter, but it's the words many times that I want to remember. So here goes my dream from last night (or early this morning)... A little background first for those who don't know or remember who I am... my mother died quite suddenly from her leukemia in April 2004. We were at odds with each other at the time. I started taking care of my elderly father at the time and he died this past August 2005. I've been wanting to dream about my mother and feel her presence and love since she died. I've only had a few dreams about her, maybe 4... And they have all been upsetting, never "nice feeling" dreams. Last night I had a dream of my mother. She was pregnant and ready to deliver her baby. She looked younger (she was almost 82 at her death) but in the dream "we" knew she was older like she was alive today. She said "I'm ok now I'm going to have a baby At least I think this is what she said. My dad was in my dream as was my dad's cousin, who is also deceased. My mother's cousin-in-law was in the dream and she was sobbing. This same woman was crying out of control at my mother's funeral. We were at a hotel in Disneyland. Ok everyone. What does this mean?
