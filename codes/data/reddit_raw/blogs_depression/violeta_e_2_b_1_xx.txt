I feel like holding in my anger.... or at least trying to be NICE all the time contributes to me feeling depressed. Maybe it's a good thing you're experiencing anger, maybe you deserve to express those "negative" emotions, of course without hurting anyone.... I wonder how much my not feeling worthy or feeling powerless contributes to not speaking up & holding in angry feelings and in a vicious cycle my depression will feed off feeling powerless or undeserving and create even more feelings of worthlessness.... VICIOUS CYCLE!!!! Because, feel like I don't have very good boundaries & am not nearly assertive enough when I need to tell people what I NEED & what I WANT... then my resentment & anger build up... I have definite triggers that make me so angry (especially my husband) I wish I could beat the s*** out of him.... under it I'm just so F***ing HURT!!!! And if I can get in touch with the hurt I can express it some how... cry, write, something..... And of course he can hear me better when I am sharing my "being hurti vs. Screaming & throwing things...
