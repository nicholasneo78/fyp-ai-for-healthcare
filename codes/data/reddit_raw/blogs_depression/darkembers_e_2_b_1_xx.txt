Hi everyone I'm pleased to have found this place, maybe I will find some people here who understand what it is like to be struggling with depression. I am currently locked in my own personal hell caused by years of problems that I would never wish on anyone. I have tried to cope on my own for about 15 years (I'm 28), everything has started to go well in my own life and now is the time that it has found a way out (or that's what my psychiatrist has told me). I was married on my birthday in 2005 (I keep calling it this year because I keep forgetting that were now in 2006) and my husband tries to understand but how can he really? I'm off work at the moment because it's too much for me to cope with. I've recently been forced into getting help and I'm waiting for counseling at the moment (there's a 10 week waiting list). I've also been on 10mg cipralex for the last 18 months. I think that's enough to be going on with for now, and its got to be the most somber intro I've ever written! I do look forward to chatting to you all Deb x
