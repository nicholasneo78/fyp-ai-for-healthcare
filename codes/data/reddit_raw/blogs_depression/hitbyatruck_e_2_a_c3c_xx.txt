Well, I'm a sixteen year old girl, and my name is to be unknown, so just call me Kat. I think I have depression, and others have told me that I may, because I have mood swings, I constantly think of death / suicide, and I do cut myself, a lot. When I'm sad I will cry and I will throw up sometimes on purpose. I have issues with the way I look, because I am overweight, and I am insecure about my weight. I have moments where I break down at school in the girls' bathroom and I do carry a razor blade around with me and I will cut myself at school. I have scars everywhere on my arms and some on my legs, and the scars do overlap each other. I have a friend who I like to talk to, and sometimes it helps. I have tried to talk to other friends, but they don't care. So yeah, my parents know I cut, and they're also thinking about getting a divorce and taking me away from the school I love.. I don't know if anyone here cares. Or if anyone here thinks I'm just another fake teen crying for attention .. but I don't care, this is what's with me, and it does hurt..
