I'm going to start with the apology. To all my friends here, and everyone is, whether you've read anything I've written or not, I am so sorry that I have not been able to offer you support. I get into your threads, and the words just don't come. Sometimes the best I can do is just a hi, I was here. I'll start the explanation, but this thread may take me a week or so to finish, as I hate long posts, and it's so much effort to try and find the words. I am in major trouble at work. I'm to blame, although someone I thought was a friend, complained about me - I don't do enough work, don't work fast enough, and do not work efficiently or accurately enough, and she complained to the right person. Let's get out of chronological order. Due to weird circumstances, I went for about 3 months without medicines, and therapy. In November, I was at the bottom of a deep, dark pit, so called my psychiatrist, Barry. Surprising for me, I went back with a new, improved attitude. We'd had a couple of productive sessions when annual reviews came out. I called him for advice, and thought that while the advice he offered was good, that he was not being supportive at all. I actually thought about how to discuss with him how his response made me feel, rather than just shut him out. We had a couple of excellent sessions, which apparently told him that something had triggered defensive coping skills, and where my mind actually was. Can't write anymore tonight, other than, Scarlet, hang in there, you're in for the ride of your life. You truly are going to be a fabulous mother, trust me. Jill, that snail-mail card almost gave me a heart attack. You are beyond awesome, that you could reach out to me in the midst of your own problems. I will write, appropriately. Tiny, thank you. Cat, is Boerne anywhere near you? Enough, thanks for reading. love you all, deb
