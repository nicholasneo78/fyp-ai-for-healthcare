I'm 20 years old ..... things have been getting harder and harder lately ... i stopped cutting for 9 months .... but i fell apart and got back into it a few days ago .... i cut really bad tonight, and i feel like such a failure .... all i can do is sit here and cry .... the loneliness is really starting to get me ... i just need someone to talk to that understands ... i am seeing doctors and taking medications but they do nothing for me .... the momentary bliss from cutting is all i have since I'm a loner and can't get over my ex ..... if anyone out there understands or doesn't mind listening, please please let me know ....
