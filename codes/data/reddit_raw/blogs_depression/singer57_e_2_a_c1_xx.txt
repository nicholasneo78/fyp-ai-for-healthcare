Besides the issue with the jealousy which is probably related to this thread there are other things which you all may or may not relate to. i'm 24 years old but am feeling a huge burden to accomplish things from my boyfriend, parents and society in general. Not to say that i don't want to accomplish things ... i most definitely do thing is that i am not sure what area i should be focusing on. i'm in school currently for dancing and though i feel competitive i'm losing focus once again. i get bored easily and always want to try new things. which makes it impossible to advance at any one thing. i also enjoy writing and singing. i love singing actually but am not sure what or how to do anything with it. while some expect me to use my college degree to get a regular job ... which i'm starting to think is what i should do, others think i should waitress and do what it takes to advance creatively. all in all i am stuck. i am on my spring break and am doing nothing, i need a job and though i feel i need to go out and do something, i'm really depressed. how can i get out of this rut i'm in. and actually start doing things when i'm not even sure what it is i want to do?
