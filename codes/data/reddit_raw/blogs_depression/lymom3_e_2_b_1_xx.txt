Feeling Good is an excellent book. I have re-read a few times when I've felt the need. If you are looking at something for anxiety and panic, I suggest Mastering Anxiety and Panic revision III (map-3) by David Barlow. I suffered from anxiety, panic attacks and agoraphobia from the time I was 12 until last year...that's 30 years. Nothing had ever helped until I found a therapist that uses that program. A different way of looking at things and I have to say that I worked miracles for me. I am driving, flying, going to concerts, sporting events...things I haven't done for over 20 years. I NEVER thought I could get better and only went because my boyfriend of 8 years was honest with me and told me that he didn't know if he could spend the rest of his life going every place alone. That was a wake up call for me and to my surprise, I found that I COULD do it. I still have my depression and I am endlessly working on being medicated correctly for that.... all of you know how that is. You can buy just the workbook www.oup.com (Oxford University Press). Well worth the money.
