Hello, I think this is where I introduce myself...I'm 34 I've been suffering severely with depression since I was 6. I've not yet been properly diagnosed, most likely because I have to go to the county and I live in the poorest county in California. I know I'm EXTREMELY obsessive compulsive, I've been told I'm major depression, ocd, add, and now may possibly be bipolar of the severe kind....oh. boy. I'm confused as hell. I have no mentally ill friends and the others just take advantage of me. If I try to talk to my mom she breaks down, she is trying more now, it's just recently they really started believing I'm really ill and not jus a hustler. The medications have been tearing me apart, one almost gave me a heart attack. I would really like to talk to someone who understands me with out having to go to the 3rd floor again. Maybe there's someone out there who has a sensitivity to these medicines too ... who can help? so far some take off the edge, but I always end up breaking down and EXPLODING. I can't hold down a job, and with the state off the economy I can't get disability...so sometimes It's the streets. I'm REALLY TIRED, can anyone feel me? Thanks for your time,
