I got up and realized I had not given my diabetic shot that I need to give at night. Therefore, my readings were off the chart, and I don't feel well. I hate this! I am trying to get my diabetes on track but i can't. I hate feeling as if I am so stupid that I can't control what my body does. I didn't get much sleep, I didn't have breakfast, I have a headache, I am getting sick, I didn't do well in a competition on Sunday that everyone that I would do well in, my grades in school are going down and grades are due Wednesday (let me know when I'm rambling!) and I have to be in school because its MONDAY. Top it off with trying to stop cutting and I have a very crappy morning to start out my week with. Anyone else every have a morning like this. I don't know what to do because I have to around people and I don't like people when I have mornings like this. Tell me, do these mornings get any better as the day goes on? Does anyone else have mornings like this, where all you want to do is stay in your room under the covers and read. Hmmmm. Well, school bell is going to ring. I'm glad I got this off my chest, but it didn't help as much as I had hoped. Anybody have any suggestions for making a bad day better?
