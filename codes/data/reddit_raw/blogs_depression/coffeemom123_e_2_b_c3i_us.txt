I am a 40 year old mother of two; ages 14 and 4. I guess I have been depressed about everything more recently, but have been really depressed for about 5 + years now. I thought bringing a new child into my life 4 years ago would help, but it only increased. I am so lonely, with no friends (well, one) since I moved to upper New York 4 1/2 years ago from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I love my children, and my 21 hour job (that my doctor suggested). However, I do get to talk (chat) with anyone. I get every morning thinking that this day will be better, but it turns out to be sometimes worst than the day before ..... I guess, I am writing this to gain some friends, and feel that I am not alone in this situations I feel I am into .... I don't drink, I don't do drugs, and I take my prescribed Medications like I am suppose too ..... Is there anyone out there that would like to talk, or write, or e-mail me?
