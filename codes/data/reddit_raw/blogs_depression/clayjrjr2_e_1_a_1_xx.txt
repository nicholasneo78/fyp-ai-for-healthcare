I'm new here. But, I would like to know how to tell if I'm in depression. I have no idea where to post this at, but since I'm new here I guess this is the best place. Plus I can't start a new topic so... Well, anyway, here's how it is: Some days I can go without thinking about her, but at night, when I rest my head on my pillow, she eventually runs across my mind. When I say she, I mean my ex. More like.... I'm her ex. But eh... this took place a while back. Maybe like.... a year and a half. I met her 3 years ago in High-school. She was my very first true girlfriend and I didn't want anything to mess that up, but somehow I did that myself... or something along those lines. After a while of missing someone it doesn't really matter who was the blame for what. Sometimes when I make music I sing lyrics about her and how I want another chance and whatever. I'm not really obsessed with her or anything, but I sometimes want to just forget about her all at once, or wish I could go back 3 years. I guess that might be linked to regrets? Anyway, this whole thing is sort of an ON-OFF type thing, where sometimes I can't help but think about how it was, and sometimes, she's that last thing on my mind. Sort of like I put her on the back of my mind not to think about her, and save my hurt of later?? ... If that sounds right... Maybe I need a shrink. Who knows.... maybe i just need another girl.... But I'm pretty sure no other girl is going to want to listen to me talk about my past relationships. Anyway, feedback is appreciated
