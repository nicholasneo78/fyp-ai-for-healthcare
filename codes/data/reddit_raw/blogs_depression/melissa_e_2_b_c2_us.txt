I've had United Healthcare as my health insurer for 7 years. For the past 6 years they have dutifully paid 80% of my weekly visits to my psychiatrist without any problem. Then, quite suddenly last August, they stopped paying my doctor anything for my visits. The insurer say that I'm only entitled to 30 mental health visits per year according to the contract, but my doctor insists that the insurer is required to forewarn her and me the patient when benefits are about to expire. Neither of us received any notice that my benefits were about to expire. My doctor and I have written letters and called the insurer asking them appeal my case, but they refuse to allow me any more benefits for visits. So I'm going to have to pay my doctor about $4,000 out of pocket. 

Is there anything else I can do to fight my insurance company? My doctor and I both feel blindsided by the insurer and are furious.
