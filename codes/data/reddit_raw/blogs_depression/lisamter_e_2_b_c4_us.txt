I have so much pent up anger that I carry around with me all the time. It seems as though it's about 4 years old and it's now catching up to me. And I'm telling people off left and right. I will honestly admit, I talk a lot of shit and in the end people somehow walk all over me. Well, not any more and not this time. I always have a string of bad luck and tonight was no different when I was at brooks picking up some medications and the cashier slammed my change down and threw my slip at me. I told her off then formally complained about her. And you know something? It felt damn good, defending myself.

Maybe it will boost some confidence in me because I have none
