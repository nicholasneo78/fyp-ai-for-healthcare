i need to examine my schedule so i start getting more than three hours of sleep a night. This will not work when school comes around. Next week already. one class, four days a week, five weeks, then I'm done forever. Bloody finally. Goals at hand: get rid of things i don't need/want, save money, clean the car out and wash him, talk to landlord about subleasing, investigate work opportunities, drag the cat tree upstairs, clean apartment. need to start getting rid of things in Wisconsin too. Hoping to make a few weekend trips so i can load up the car and bring stuff back here and take my time going through everything. i feel rushed. Bed now with a book for a few pages.
