I'm 16 years old. I am having problems in school and I feel like dropping out. I also feel like committing suicide. I have foster parents and I don't like them one bit. I cry every night because I miss my mom. At this point in life I don't feel a need in living. I really need your help and advice to make me feel more comfortable talking to my foster parents and to convince me not to kill myself. I am a very suicidal person who is looking for help. I have a record of cutting myself and burning myself so i think that the cutting and burning led to suicidal attempts I am looking for help. i don't know what led suicide but if anyone has any advice on what i could do or any questions please tell me
