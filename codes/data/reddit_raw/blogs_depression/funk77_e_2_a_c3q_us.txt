I tried to get onto the chat room, but it won't let me so I'll just post my question here. In my sociology class today my professor was talking about an experiment where several pseudomanic (healthy) patients checked into mental hospitals to record the results. The details of the experiment aren't important, but what I was wondering was about how my teacher said that the patients used fake names so that it would not be on their permanent record and so that they wouldn't be labeled as "crazy". So I raised my hand and asked who would be labeling them and why they couldn't use their real names, like how would people know? He said that it would be on their record and that if people wanted to find out if they have ever been hospitalized they could, particularly employers. Kind of like if you wanted to inquire about a rapist living in your town, is what he said. I wanted to ask more but didn't want to press it. So my questions are, what kind of record does this go on? Your hospital record? Your police record? When employers do a background check, does this show up? Then I was wondering, when police pull you over for speeding or something and they check your information on their computer, what comes up? Everything? If they were involved in an ambulance taking someone into the hospital, do they have that on file? Is there any way to see what's on your file? I'm just a little paranoid now about if there are going to be limitations in life now as to what I can do because of my record.

Or if anyone knows how I would be able to find out this information that would be great,
