Hey all, I moved away from my home town 17 years ago and have only gone back for short visits and never met up with any of the people I used to hang around with. These girls still live in the town and still after all these years talk of me and not nice either, the reason I know this is because another friend told me. I am not putting them down but the only reason I can think of is because they are angry and jealous of me as I have been on a sort of adventure instead of staying home and being a single mum. I really can't think what I did that was so bad to them that they still put me down and hate me. They even shouted out my name then said is a **** I was with my mum and it was awful. I was excited about moving there but now I am dreading it and I am petrified incase they decide to start making my life bad when it will be a struggle educating my family on my illness. I just don't know what to and I would appreciate any advice please. HiddenLady
