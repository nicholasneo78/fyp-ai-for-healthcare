Iâ€™m New to this site, I was diagnosed with SLE Lupus about eight months ago and i'm on very strong treatment using predinsone. Everyone around me noticed it first I guess since I was suddenly so quiet, moody and would cry at the drop of a hat. Which, was so unlikely of me I used to crack jokes laugh and my goal was always to have fun and make other's laugh. But since my diagnosis and medications (which I counted and i'm taking like almost 100 pills a week and I just turned 22 yesterday, honestly i'd never thought i'd be in this state at 22 a few years ago) 
Anyway I never wanted to admit it, depression is not only a symptom of lupus but it's a side effect of the medication as well, and I think that it's a general first reaction to being told that you have an incurable disease. But I finally am starting to see it now I think that i'm really depressed.

I was never a quiet girl but now i'm so quiet that I think i'm scaring everyone.

but now i'm living with my wonderful boyfriend who seems to understand everything so well and is so patient with me. But I just need a place where I can talk this out with people who understand.
