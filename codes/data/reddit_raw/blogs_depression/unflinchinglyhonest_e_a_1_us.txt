I was just reading back over the past few entries. I have been in tough shape and I didn't realize how tough until I read it over. The depression, the arthritis, and the circumstances of my life all have been conspiring to keep me down.  My therapist was right, I think, when she said on Monday that I needed sometime to just "be". I've stopped answering my phone and have spend most of the past few days watching DVDs, playing computer games and resting my sore body. I feel better emotionally since I have been doing this. I wish I didn't feel so horribly guilty for checking out of the world for a few days, but I'm willing to cope with it if it makes ma feel a little better. The other thing I am feeling guilty about is this training I am supposed to go to in Washington, DC in two weeks. I feel like if I go I will be letter all sorts of people down at work. I have even contacted the people running the training and asked if I can delay it, but it is now or never and since it is all expenses paid in Washington for three days if I pass it up at the last minute I am screwing someone else out of the opportunity. If I go or if I don't go I am going to feel guilty and selfish. I'm not going to decide now though.  I am just going to keep up with the resting for another day.
