I've dealt with panic / anxiety / depression / ptsd for some time now.   I was in a 14 year abusive marriage and it has been two years since I left that marriage.  This past August was one year since my divorce was final.  I have two children, both boys, 6 and 10.  My ten year old has ADHD and depression.  I worry constantly for my kids because of what they saw during our marriage. 

There are so many times I get so overwhelmed and just need to be around people who just "get it."  When I left, I brought my kids and myself home to my parents.  I have been with them since.  My mother, doesn't "get it."  She thinks that just because I left the marriage, I should be okay by now.  Well I guess 14 years may take a little longer than 2 years to fix. 

I used to come here a long time ago.  I'm glad I came back.  I have seen so many familiar faces already and met new ones as well.  I just want a place where I feel I belong.  A place where I can go when I just need someone to be there.  It's been a long road, with many twists and turns ... I guess it's like that poem, the road less traveled.  I guess that means learning the hard way.
