I'm really new at this, and I'm sure that all of you have your own problems, but i figure who better to ask then other people who might feel the same as i do. I just turned 15 and i have suffered from depression or what i am almost sure is depression for about 4 years now. I have tried telling my parents about it, and they just won't listen, they say that I'm just going through normal teenage stuff, but if this is normal, then i would hate to see what depression is really like. I have attempted suicide before, but i was caught, i have cut my self and I'm trying to stop, i have a boyfriend and a family that loves me, and i know this. But i can't seem to get through to my parents that i need help, i want help, they just don't get it that i am not feeling normal. I really need help, and they won't listen, how am i suppose to get it if they won't listen, recently they found my blades and everything under my bed and they have seen where i have cut before and i don't know if they just don't want to believe it or what, but all of the signs are there for them and they just won't do anything about it. They also found pills that i had been taking and still didn't do anything but "talk" to me about it. And my boyfriend, i know he loves me, and i want to tell him about my problem, but i just can't, I'm afraid that he may leave me because of it. and i know that would be all it would take to throw me over the edge and cause me to do something drastic! I'm not sure what to do about any of it, can someone PLEASE PLEASE help me??? my email is xxx i need help and i want help, and if any one else needs help then you can e-mail me and i will help the best that i can!
