hi, I'm a 21 year-old male from the uk, over the past few months I have become increasingly depressed.  I'm always acting the joker and appear to be happy at university and work but every night I go to bed and hope that I won't wake up in the morning. For the past 3 or 4 years I've had an overwhelming feeling that I won't live very long and over the past few months I have the sensation that I will die very soon. my depression also leads me to get very angered.  I've never spoken to anyone about this.
