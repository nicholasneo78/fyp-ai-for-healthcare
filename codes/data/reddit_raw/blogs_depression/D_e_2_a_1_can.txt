Hi everyone. I am also a new member. I'm 22 years old and a single mother of one. I have had bipolar tendencies since I was a young child and was diagnosed at 16 or 17. The past few years since my daughter was born have been the best ones for my moods. I attribute part of that to the success I seemed to have on Lithium for two years. I stupidly went off the medicines and my thyroid medicines as well in November without telling my doctor. Lately things have gotten fairly rough. I know I have to get back in to the doctor, and I will. It's just that my life is so busy right now that it's hard to find the time (and the courage!). I'm glad I found this great site. It is great to hear others stories and to not feel alone. So, nice to "meet" you all.
