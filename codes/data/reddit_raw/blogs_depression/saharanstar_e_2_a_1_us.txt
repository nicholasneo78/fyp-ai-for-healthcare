I can't do it anymore, i am waiting for the right moment to do it i know that i will do it i just need to wait for the precise moment i think that it will be off in the distance but a part of me welcomes it at any given time the chance to rid myself of this turmoil this pain this disgusted feeling i have inside of myself... i actually have began to feel more emotional and it scares me because i don't want to be like that but i don't want to be a rock either i remember everything what have a i become a monster stares into my eyes reminding me that i am not who i think i am that life is not great for me that it doesn't matter what happens to me because i so will leave and a weight will be lifted from those around me and i am okay knowing that there will be things that i will never see things i will never know but i accept it...
