New members. I am 51 and have to take antidepressants for life. Now that I have accepted the fact I can get on with the things I want to do. My interests are varied, also hobby and I do lots together. When I had depression and anxiety I couldn't leave the house. which wasn't much of a life for him. Therapy also helped over the years.
