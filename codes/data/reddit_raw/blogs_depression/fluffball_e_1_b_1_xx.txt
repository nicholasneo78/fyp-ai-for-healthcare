I would like to say hello to everyone, I have bipolar and was doing a bit of research into my illness, which I have not done before as I have always denied having the illness. I do have funny story to tell. A few years ago now I lost the plot and lost my home wife and children as a result. Not that funny but at the time I did not know I had bipolar. New life spending loads of money racing up the career ladder (on a High) I meet this fantastic girl. We went on holidays together had some great times. After a year or two I moved in with this girl gave up my good job and planned a future for us both marriage extra. There was one thing holding us back we both hard bipolar and never told each other about or illness as we thought this could change everything. As you can imagine if she when on a high I went on a low , and when I went on a high starting companies and buying things I could not afford she would go on a low. Our relationship did not last for much longer as she would self harm and I would attempt suicide. It wasn't until I went into hospital that it all came out in the open. We are still friends but both agree that two bipolar people do not match. My doctor did smile and we did laugh about it. Anyway I am new and just want to say hi to everyone.
