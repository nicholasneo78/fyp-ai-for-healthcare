I'm having a problem with my depression. You see, I'm taking more medicine. I'm taking Welbrutrin (150mg) on top of my Zoloft (100mg). I've been out of work for over 5 months. And it is now SERIOUSLY making me crazy. I need to talk with people, but I don't know how. I need to find a job, but I don't know how. I am a good guy. In fact I am THE good guy. All of the people who have had me to work for them have loved me. I get promotions all of the time. It's getting in the door that seems to be the problems. And I have a family to take care of. My wife started working, but it won't be enough to pay the rent. This is so hard for me. I am of the old school. I believe in chivalry, the man taking care of his family. Except that I feel like I'm being less of a man. I am broken. I don't know what to do. I can see myself being suicidal, but not in the sense of killing myself, but for looking for someone to help me. God I've never been in such trouble. And I don't feel loved. It's not my wife, it's not my son. But I think that not working for so long, and the fact that I don't have friends, makes me need contact with people. Any people. I just don't know how to do that.
