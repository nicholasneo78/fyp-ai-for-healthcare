I think I have insomnia and depression. I don't sleep at night. I stay up and think. I toss and turn. My mind races. And my life has gone nowhere. I'm in college and lately I just haven't been able to function. At first I thought it was laziness, but it's much more than that. I don't even feel like doing the things I used to. I don't feel like hanging out with my friends. I'm normally kind of introverted but it has definitely gotten worse lately. I have just wanted to be alone. All i've been doing is sleeping during the day .. just laying around ... zoning out ... I really haven't felt like doing anything at all. All I want is to crawl into a hole and sleep forever. I have so much to do schoolwork - wise and I just can't too it. I'm physically, emotionally, and mentally weak. I don't know what to do. I was told to talk to our school counselor but it's really hard for me to open up to new people, especially those I don't know. I don't think I could explain my problems to him. I don't know what to do. I can't just snap back into life ... I always end up here .. empty and depressed. Why??? What should I do?
