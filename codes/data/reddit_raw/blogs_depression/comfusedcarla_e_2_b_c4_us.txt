you know how everyone hates those family get togethers, at least I do. All my family is out of state And I rarely get the chance to ever see mine, but that's off point, I have severe depression and a terrible panic disorder, at my last doctor appointment we were discussing easter coming up and how hard it is for me to go to my in laws, especially since no one there will ever talk to me,(that's a whole other subject) anyway it was suggested to me that maybe we could invite the family over here for easter so that I would feel more secure. that way i could be busy with food and not feeling bad cause no one will speak to me. MY husband at the time when I spoke to him about it said that maybe it was a good idea, would be good for me. well today we had a bit of an argument over something i tried to do in here today, i just wanted him to try and understand what its like for me since he considers this a weakness not an illness, anyway, of course he went to his mothers, and accepted her offer for dinner and then came home and announced it to me, he didn't even bring up the possibility of maybe having it at our house. not even for me (also they have no idea about my illness , he is embarrassed i think) anyway, now I feel like he will never try to take my feelings into consideration.

I fell like throwing up
I feel like shit
I feel unloved
