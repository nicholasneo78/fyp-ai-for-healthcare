This is just the tip of an iceberg. One of my best mates has just gone to prison and he has a girlfriend, last night in the pub a good friend of ours was chatting her up and trying to kiss her so i said to him what are you playing at fellow your best mates inside and your doing this! he didn't even care! so i stormed out of the pub wanting to kick his head in. should i have stuck my nose in or should i have turned a blind eye? i think i did the right thing. We are a good bunch of lads who have been threw thick and thin together . But just lately all of us have been out of order to each other so are we really mates? what are mates? we are all stabbing each other in the back and its getting me down I think its because we are always drunk half of the time what do u guys think? is it all part of getting older? we are all in our early 20s now.
