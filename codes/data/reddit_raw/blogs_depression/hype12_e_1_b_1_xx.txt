This is a really great forum and nice to know there are other men out there willing to help as they know what it's like. It's also funny how sometimes what you think you are doing and what other perceive are totally different. For example, my wife has recently stated that she feels like she's living in a "glass jar." What she means it that due to my depression and anxiety she, at times, feels like she has to act or say things differently because of how she thinks I'm going to interpret them. Whereas all I want is for her to act normal and do and act as she was and let me deal with the insecurities and issues. I hope this is making some sense to some of you and if so, any suggestions on what to do? Thanks!
