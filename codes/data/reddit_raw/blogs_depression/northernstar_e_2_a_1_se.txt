Hi, I'm 19 and new here. I've suffered from acute depression for getting on for 18 months now. I currently take Citalopram, having tried Fluoxetine but it wasn't doing much good for me. I self-harmed on-and-off from the age of 16 to 18 and have been stopped since last June. I recently became engaged (on Boxing Day!) and last month emigrated to live with my fiance. I have previously received some CBT for depression and OCD but that stopped when I went to university in Sept 2005. My mental health deteriorated drastically whilst at university and in December I made the decision to leave. I am hoping that I will soon be able to get some counseling or other sort of psychological therapy here, and to start coming off my medication at some point soon, although I don't want to rush that as I don't want a relapse.
