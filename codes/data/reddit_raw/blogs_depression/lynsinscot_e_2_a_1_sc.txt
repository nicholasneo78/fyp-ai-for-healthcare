Hi I'm a 20 year old gal from west coats of Scotland and i feel i need somewhere to spill my thoughts. I'm a student nurse with 2 part time jobs and college so obviously in stressed and id doesn't help that I'm in a big bit of debt. I'm listening to songs which usually maked me happy and i cry, I tend to drink quite a bit because I'm so unhappy, i don't know what to do , I feel as though everyone is passing me by in my life I'm overweight which doesn't help the situation although i am trying to lose it. it doesn't work. I've been in trouble with the police as i went off the rails i started taking drugs which made me happy and then got warnings from the police. I seem to be writing this and not making any sense to my self. Does anyone else feel like this as i feel as i feel like I'm the only one that feels like this. I sit and wonder what it be like if i didn't exist would anyone miss me would anyone notice if i didn't turn up for college or work. My life feels so useless there are people dying from disease and instead of me they could have a longer life if they took my place, i don't know what else to do i cant talk openly about how i feel so i have to resort to a web based environment , don't think i don't have plenty of friends because i do i just feel as they have enough to worry about instead if thinking about me. If anyone else out there wants to chat feel free. Wouldn't blame you if you didn't. The best times of my life at the moment are when I'm sleeping.
