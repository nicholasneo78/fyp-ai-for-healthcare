before i start i want to apologize to everyone for not offering much support recently. For those of you not in a good place right now, i hope things start to ease for you soon. Sending my love to you all and i am thinking about everyone.

Lycan hope your hangover is well and truly gone and that you are ready for another week at work.

Well i went to the GP on thursday and she was really lovely, really listened to what i had to say and she wants me to go away and consider going on antidepressants, before i make a final decision.

While there she spotted a mole on my arm and she looked through this little gadget. She thinks its skin cancer (Melanoma) and has sent an urgent referral to the dermatologist. So i am now waiting on an appointment for a biopsy. I am kind of upset about it, i know they can probably get rid of it, but it doesn't stop the panic attacks and anxiety.


So all in, I am not in a good place right now, but hopefully things will start to get better soon.
