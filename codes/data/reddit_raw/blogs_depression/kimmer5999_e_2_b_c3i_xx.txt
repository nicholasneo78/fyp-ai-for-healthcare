I'm a 30 year old, married, stay at home mom to 4 kids.  I was diagnosed with depression about 2 years ago after some MAJOR problems in my marriage.  Although I've been in and out of depression for the last 14 years.  I was put on Prozac, took that for 2 years and made the mistake of taking myself off it.  So, I'm right back where I started from.  I think for me a lot of it is .... my life should have been so much different.  I shouldn't have gotten married at 19 (even though I love him), should have finished college, etc .... there are so many should haves you know?  I've been suicidal ... though not for a long time.  I know there are things I need to do for my kids and my family, but many days I just can't bring myself to do them.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME???  Even though I know the answer I ask the question every day.  Why can't I be normal?  Why can't I just be a wife and a mother and have that be enough? 

I wish everyone well in this terrifying journey we all have to endure.
