Ok, so i've had depression for at least 4 years and it has gotten a lot worse the past two. My mom tried shoving prozac down my throat and swore that it helped me, but it didn't. I didn't talk to a counselor until about a month a go.  I was going to school and every time i went to main campus i would get Ds and Fs. I would start out ok but then end up sleeping more and more. This past quarter i physically could not get out of bed at one point. My parents just saw it as me blowing my last chance at college and took it as i didn't care. It seems like i don't feel anymore. I do care that i blew my last chance at college and i finally decided to see a counselor 3 weeks before the end of the quarter. My parents said the only reason i did that is because i knew i was in trouble and just needed an excuse. I don't know why i don't do the things i know i should be doing. I just feel like i can't. My parents say it's all my fault, that i don't take responsibility for anything and I just want to blame everything on something else. Which isn't the case. They don't think that depression has anything to do with not trying, that it doesn't affect rational decision making. I'm starting to think it doesn't either. I mean, why can't i do the things i know I'm suppose to do? The things that will better my life. The things that will make my parents proud? Is it the depression or am I truly lazy and just don't care??? Because everything my parents are saying is making me think it really is just me and i don't have depression.
