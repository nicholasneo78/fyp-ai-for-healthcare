i can only do so many intro's, then i get real sick of talking (writing) about me. i have depression/anxiety. I'm not medicated, and though the va would provide medicines, I'm done with them for now. Now that I've not homeless anymore i have the stability to get proper rest and nutrition, which have been sorely lacking. I've just started taking vitamins, and though i did get a membership to the ymca to work out, I've yet to bottle up the anxiety enough to go in. i used to love being in the gym, now it's available, and I'm frozen to my apartment. it will come. I've had stability for three weeks now, and I'm essentially relearning life. I've had to make myself go out and walk around the park at three in the morning to get exercise. With God's help, the support i can gather about, and an open heart, i will regain my sense of self. Thank you for being here so that i can post this. i know that you folks understand. Peace
