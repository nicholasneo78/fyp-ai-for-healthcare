" It was summer - the leather seats on my Granny's navy blue Cadillac were hot and sticky.  Going to the bank with Granny was a normal kind of errand for me and my little brother.  The First American Bank tellers were very kid-friendly; they always sent suckers for us kids when they sent back the money for Granny.  On this particular day, Granny had a telephone set in the floorboard of her car.  She was the queen of mail-order catalogs, and she had gotten this red telephone, with a red cord and handset, from one of the many catalogs that filled the end tables at her house.  The phone had big black touch tone buttons, and I was amusing myself by making lots of clicking noises as I ""dialed"" familiar numbers.  In 1987, my 8 year-old self was impressed by the thought of a phone in the car.  No one that I knew, like my parents, family or friends, owned a car phone.  As we rode down Nolensville Road, dialing those numbers made my imagination wander and soon the receiver found its way to my ear.  I became lost in a whirlwind of conversations.  Instantly, I became a wealthy young woman (since I had a ""car phone""), who was talking to famous people like country singer Reba McEntire or actor Patrick Swayze.  Patrick called me right as we pulled up to the teller at the bank.  Granny would have to get my sucker for me today - I was far too busy talking with Patrick about doing a movie next month to stop and wave at the smiling lady behind the glass.  I felt so important.  I rode around talking on my car phone for at least two weeks, until my brother pointed out that you could see the cord, and that made me look dumb.  He was just jealous that Reba didn't want him to come over and go swimming in her new heated swimming pool.

"How should i deal with angry best friend Hi guys so basically in the past year ever since I started dating a boy (he was my best friend for the most part in high school) my current best friend (a girl in my friendship group also from highshcool) and i have gotten into many fights .  These fights are mainly about her arguing that she is no longer my number one priority and that she is just second priority to my boyfriend . I do not think this is true and they are both important to me but In very different ways - he in a romantic way and she in a friendship way.  She recently came back from overseas and I organised to meet up with her and we did. I never heard from her initiating a meet up for the next few weeks or so but I finally did initiate a catch up with her after hearing nothing from her for weeks. however this plan fell through because I ended up having a work shift.   Yesterday my best friend had invited me to catch up with her before she went to work (she had work at 1pm)and I messaged her asking if we could hang out until 12pm. She asked me why I couldn’t stay until 1 with her till she had to go to work and I explained it’s bevause I had invited my boyfriend over for lunch and movies at my house (this catch up with my boyfriend was meant to be another day but got postponed to the same day as my catchup with my best friend due to him getting sick).   She got very angry and told me she now does not want to see me at all and cancelled the catchup because she said she felt second priority. She said She shouldn’t have to change her plans for my boyfriend who I see so much more compared to her (I would love to see her more but she never plans anything with me or when I do ask her when she’s free she always has family plans ?)   She also brought up the previous weeks events of me cancelling our plans due to me having work and got angry with me for never trying to find another day to make up for these cancelled plans   I tried explaining to her how important she is to me and how I don’t see her as second priority or never meant to make her feel like second priority but she is giving me silent treatment or being passive aggressive .  I am tired of having to prove to her that she is important to me and I am tired of this drama .  My boyfriend is so wonderful and he is always there for me and replies to me instantly and we share many things on a personal level (emotionally physically etc) so to me it seems natural that I will try and adjust my plans to try and accommodate him - as he does so much for me that nobody else does, not even my best friend.  so I don’t understand why she expects to be higher in priority than my bf and isn’t happy with being the same priority as him?   I am tired and confused. Don’t know how to respond to her passive and blunt messages to me after I tried apologising and explaining   Please help",0,deal angry best friend hi guy basically past year started dating boy he best friend high school current best friend a girl friendship group highshcool gotten fight fight mainly arguing longer number priority just second priority boyfriend not think true important different way romantic way friendship way recently came overseas organised meet did heard initiating meet week finally did initiate catch hearing week plan fell ended having work shift yesterday best friend invited catch went work she work pmand messaged asking hang pm asked not stay till work explained bevause invited boyfriend lunch movie house this catch boyfriend meant day got postponed day catchup best friend getting sick got angry told doe not want cancelled catchup said felt second priority said not change plan boyfriend compared i love plan ask free family plan brought previous week event cancelling plan having work got angry trying day make cancelled plan tried explaining important not second priority meant make feel like second priority giving silent treatment passive aggressive tired having prove important tired drama boyfriend wonderful reply instantly share thing personal level emotionally physically etc natural try adjust plan try accommodate doe doe not best friend not understand expects higher priority bf not happy priority him tired confused not know respond passive blunt message tried apologising explaining help
"I've been in a constant rush to try and get on my feet for the last three years, but I always end up doing nothing about it. I've forgotten what motivation is all about.  Hey there, I just turned 22. And this is my situation:  About three years ago, I used to feel excited about everything. Finishing school, starting my studies at a university, being self-sufficient, finally doing what I thought was my future career.  I'm not sure what happened, but I started losing my drive. Things didn't look as exciting, nor entertaining. Never having even kissed a girl, I felt alone and loveless. Still, I felt motivated enough to start working on my social skills, met a few people over the Internet, even got a girlfriend. (Thanks to the Internet I have a social life, as ironic as that sounds, even though it's not that good).  Fast forward to this year, I was able to date a couple more girls, had a good time but they all ended too soon. I've never been able to have sex with the girls I've been with because I lost my sex drive in the course of these last years. Also the extremely low self esteem and self hatred don't help. Today, I find myself unable to even have a conversation with someone, mostly girls. I can't come up with anything to talk about and I feel like all the things I learned about social skills have gone away suddenly. How do people have such natural conversations with one another? How did I manage to do it before? I feel like I want new friends, I want to have a good time, but can't figure out where to go, or what to do to achieve that. Regarding my studies, this year was a slow one. In the time I should have completed 50% of my career, I only completed around 20%. I started visiting a psychologist because I can't get myself to study for my exams (I'm not cooperating much with him), and all I do is worry about it though I never take up the responsibility.   I am fully aware of the fact that things don't come if you just sit and wait, but I can't bring myself to do anything other than complain. Meanwhile I feel like my mind wants to run, but doesn't know which way to go, and my body won't budge. I think 24/7 about how I'm getting older, and I'm wasting every second of my life. I'm completely lost and feel like everything I do is going nowhere. And I don't even know how to end this post, just wanted to put this somewhere and hopefully get some solutions or words of encouragement from people who've been through the same. Sorry for the long read.",1,constant rush try foot year end doing it forgotten motivation about hey there just turned situation year ago used feel excited everything finishing school starting study university selfsufficient finally doing thought future career not sure happened started losing drive thing did not look exciting entertaining having kissed girl felt loveless still felt motivated start working social skill met people internet got girlfriend thanks internet social life ironic sound not good fast forward year able date couple girl good time ended soon able sex girl lost sex drive course year extremely low self esteem self hatred not help today unable conversation someone girl come talk feel like thing learned social skill gone away suddenly people natural conversation another did manage before feel like want new friend want good time figure go achieve that regarding study year slow one time completed career completed started visiting psychologist study exam i not cooperating him worry responsibility fully aware fact thing not come just sit wait bring complain feel like mind want run doe not know way go body not budge think getting older wasting second life completely lost feel like going nowhere not know end post just wanted hopefully solution word encouragement people same sorry long read
"Can anyone cheer me up? Apparently, my dad used to work in another country. While he was away, my mom allegedly cheated on him several times.

To keep it short, when this hit me, I could not imagine her cheating on my dad. I’ve also heard that they are not divorcing because of me, which is plain stupid.

" Rant Number 2 Second day of school Oy, now we start actual keyboarding…what great joy! **coughcough** I really suck at normal keyboarding…It definitely isn’t one of my strong points. I type my own way really. Its sorta mixed up proper typing with index finger typing. You know, where you only use your index fingers to press down every single letter? Haha that’s how I used to type when I didn’t know how to. Well this is really boring… These keyboarding books look cool tho… they are more like notepads for learning how to keyboard correctly. AHHHH this is messing up my normal typing, learning this gay new way of typing…bleah this sucks. I remember learning this in sixth grade with Mr. Donovan… he was nice, but the class sucked. **15 minutes later** OMG I’m going to kill myself because this is so much different from my normal style of typing that its driving me crazy! I suck at the normal style of typing! All we are doing is a sad dad; all lads fall; asl a lass; a jak salad; BLARGH! WHO FREAKING CARES ABOUT A SAD DAD OR A JAK SALAD! WTF IS A JAK SALAD?!

"I die a little inside with every customer (TW) Let me start by saying I've been getting help for chronic depression and anxiety since January. I take sertraline (50mg) every day, and it's helped me tremendously.  I was hired as a cashier at a fast food job in November of last year, and it was a huge step forward. No education, no GED, no transportation, no job experience (except for working for a family company since I was a literal child); needless to say, I felt like I overcame a hump that had been looming in front of me for quite some time.  I've had extreme social anxiety since my early teens, so diving headfirst into a cashier job seemed a bit counter-intuitive. Now, I don't know if it was the medication or simply having no choice but to face my fears every day, but the anxiety has completely faded.  Gone. Zilch.  Good, right? Well, in its place, a little seedling sprouted, and as time goes by it swells inside my heart and head, pushes against my skull, crushes my organs, my spark, my will to move forward.  I hate people so fucking much.  I am so damn tired of hearing you complain that the price of a sandwich has increased by fifty fucking cents. I am so damn tired of cleaning up after your little brats after they throw their food on the floor.  I am so fucking fed up with you cancelling an entire fucking order, after it was already prepared, because the soda machine was out of cherry Fanta. What the fuck is wrong with you? I go home and utterly dread the next day of picking up the slack of my coworkers and dealing with a shitload of entitled, spoiled assholes.  Every now and then, there is an angel. Someone who isn't a total asshole to me...it could be something so small to you, but it can make my entire day that much easier. Perhaps you already know what you want to order, and don't hold up a line of ten people because you're picky as fuck. Perhaps you tip me 96 cents. Usually, it's treating me like I'm a feeling, thinking human instead of the shit on your heel.  I bend over backwards for these people and do my best to let them know that they're truly appreciated.  I've come so far, and yet I'm so close to giving up. It's wearisome forcing a smile every day and powering through as if I have a promising future, when I don't. I pretend that I don't slice my thighs with razors, that I'm not covered in self harm scars, that all is well. I pretend I don't fantasize every day about diving headfirst in front of a semi truck. I pretend the love of my life and best friend isn't homeless and isn't living in a tent with a heroin addict. I pretend, I pretend, I pretend. I am so tired.

"I am in a state of emptiness. Recently, I was in a relationship with someone who didn't love me, but I loved them intensely. I had hoped eventually she would turn around, but for that time, I found deep meaning in her. Now it's over, and she doesn't seem to care. Meanwhile, I am in hell. It's like the past four years of my life were just a dream. I feel humiliated, used and defeated. I feel like I have nothing. I lost my job, stopped going to school, and was forced to move back in with my parents. I feel like a total failure and completely worthless. I feel like I am being punished by God, and there is no way out. Even in my dreams I can't escape the pain. I can't see the good in anything anymore. Everywhere, I see pain and suffering, with no hope. Even when I meet incredible people who am in awe of, I feel almost envious, knowing that I am a worthless, useless nothing in the presence of angels. I still have some friends, but have grown distant from them. Seeing their success, no matter how minute, just reminds me of my worthlessness. I have nothing to offer the world. I am without purpose.  Even when I have enough things to distract me, my ex is still in my dreams or nightmares every night. Before I met her, I got my life on track, was kicking ass in school, and headed for something. I know I can't blame her, but I just feel so stupid for getting caught up in her drama for no reason. What a waste.  I don't know. I've been reflecting on my life a lot. I'm 27 and have nothing to show for it. I feel like I have to make drastic changes. Liquor and drugs are not doing me any good. I don't know what the hell I want anymore. I'm so lost, sometimes I don't even know if I'm really alive.  I feel like right now, I have to settle for mediocrity and hope for simple low - stress job that pays the bills, but I don't have any source of joy or anything really to look forward too.  I've pinpointed that the major source for depression and life problems as been my self-hatred. It manifests itself in many forms, including obsessive feelings of inadequacy and incompetence, paranoia, being overly - sensitive to criticism, feeling worthless, hopeless, and giving up too easy because of those feelings.  Where did all this self - hatred come from? I don't want to blame my parents at my age, but I know that how they treated me when I was younger affected me and it still lingers in my psyche. They always employed the shame approach to parenting. Anytime something happened, my father would curse at me, and lecture me on how worthless I was. He would glare at me, and I just had to sit there and listen. Sometimes I would start crying, and then he would yell at me for crying, and say shit like ""look at you, you're not even ashamed."" Shame was apparently a virtue. My mother once told me when I was 8 that she wanted to have a third child, but because I was such a disappointment, she decided against it. They hit me frequently, with a bamboo stick. I remember they would constantly compare me to their friend's children, praising them and ask me why I couldn't be more like them.  So all this happened, but I can't change the past. I don't want to dwell and blame my parents for their mistakes, no one is a perfect parent. I just want to get over these feelings of self - hatred and get my life in order. I've identified the source of my depression, but haven't been able to change all those feelings and thought-processes that have been ingrained in me since early childhood. Does anyone have any advice on how to overcome these feelings, and gain a sense of confidence and direction back?

"Should family be more than this? I’m 24 and no kids and my family is just like everyone else’s around me; broken.  My dad is sometimey and has kept few promises he has made to me. In the end it’s not him being bad that’s the problem, it’s that he says the problem is ME. Like with men I have talked to in the past, they can only say what I’M doing wrong not listening to me and claiming I am crazy.  This behavior with my father led me to cutting off all contact late last year. My family, his side, otherwise see nothing wrong with his behavior. The issue is ME. I’m expecting too much from him.....like if he says he’s coming to our city (he lives 30 mins away) and I get upset when he doesn’t show and he’s done it just about every time. Or even when he claims he’s coming to get the dog he left with my uncle (left him there a year ago claiming it would only be for two weeks) he just lies constantly.  I was raised around my family growing up. I didn’t see my father but I saw his side of the family, cousins, aunts and uncles. They may have lived states away but we always spent summers and holidays together.  At this point my family on either side rarely see each other. We have family reunions that none of my cousins attend, all too busy now that their grown.  At the end of the day I was told this;  I’m an adult and my father has nothing to do with the things I’ve done in life, or nothing to do with the guys I used to talk to that led to constant rejection and overall cynical view on love (getting sperm donor at 28.)  I should be grateful for times spent with him, five minutes should be the best in the world (he’s so self absorbed I’m only worth five minutes every few months)  I have no right as a child to threaten him if he wont leave me alone for good.  I don’t see why I have to live like this, I suffer from depression and constantly beatbox myself up over every mistake I make. I’m unhappy, I’ve been getting better since getting rid od him and focusing on the family that actually has time time for me.   A family shouldn’t just be there for emergency. A family is thinking of others before themselves, loving one another enough to know them. Am I really expecting or demanding too much?  Am I just mad because yet another man won’t do what I want?",0,family this kid family just like me broken dad sometimey kept promise me end not bad problem say problem me like men talked past say im doing wrong not listening claiming crazy behavior father led cutting contact late year family side wrong behavior issue me expecting himlike say coming city he life min away upset doe not just time claim coming dog left uncle left year ago claiming week just lie constantly raised family growing up did not father saw family cousin aunt uncle lived state away spent summer holiday together point family rarely other family reunion cousin attend busy grown end day told this adult father thing life guy used talk led constant rejection overall cynical view love getting sperm donor grateful time spent him minute best world he self absorbed worth minute month right child threaten wont leave good not live like this suffer depression constantly beatbox mistake make unhappy getting better getting rid od focusing family actually time time me family not just emergency family thinking themselves loving know them really expecting demanding much just mad man not want

Feel free to ignore it.(Potential Triggers: Domestic and parental abuse, self harm, bullying, substance abuse etc. Avoiding detail AMAP) I am so sick of trying to just survive each day. I want more than anything to go out and live my life. I want a job, an apartment, a pet... but instead I’m stuck living with my grandparents because I’m at the point where my agoraphobia is so bad I can BARELY leave my bed. I don’t think I have felt “happy” for more than 10 minutes at any given time in the last 6 months. I applied to try to get a tattoo to cover some scars I have from when I got really bad, but they never contacted me again...so that reminder is always there making me feel sick and myself and taunting me to do it again just to numb the crap in my head. I’m trying to be a partner to this amazing guy I care a ton about, but I feel so emotionally shut down that I don’t even react to jokes or love anymore. I don’t even like when he cuddles me because his breath on my neck is a trigger... Now, I do not have it as bad as a lot of other people. I grew up in a family with a loving (OCD) grandmother, a grandfather, and a (drug addict) mother who all always made sure I had food and a place to sleep. That alone is more than a lot of people get...but every time I try to talk to someone and they don’t respond to me I flip out at them because my mom didn’t want me to interrupt her high. When something goes SLIGHTLY wrong or is a SMIDGE out of place I panic because that’s all I had around me. When someone on the street spits I flinch because my ex’s favourite way to degrade me was to spit in my face while mocking me. When I go downtown I get anxious because that’s where I was publicly beating by a (different yet no les “charming”) ex. I avoid drinking now because I don’t want to fall into drinking to feel happy again and I definitely don’t want to add to my scars...but this is all I have known my whole life. Every time I try to take a step forward, improve myself, or even leave the house to do something I once enjoyed, it feels like the weight of every circumstance and bad decision in my life is right there to push me further into the dirt. The only ways I know how to make money aren’t things I want to do...the only people in my life I want to be around I can’t stand to be near...I feel like I have nothing left to hold onto and I’m drowning!

Is my sons mother justified in demanding I stop trying to give my 17 month old son a high five?

"How to drift away from a 'best friend' you don't like anymore? I have a friend, and I am trying to put distance between us. They're generally a nice person (but do some mean things occasionally), but they're quite... boring. Okay, very boring. I don't even know how I have been able to put up with the lack of interesting conversation for the past 2 years. I need a best friend with whom I can laugh about fun stuff and not just talk about SCHOOL.   Let's call them B.   B has clung to me for the past 2 years, so they don't have any other friends. I have loads of other friends, but they all assume that I'm best friends with B, so they don't make an effort to include me in their friendship group. I've told quite a few of them, and they are giving me some advice on what to do, but I want to see what all of you say.   For the past few weeks, I have been making it quite clear that I don't really want to talk to B. I give them short answers as replies, don't make eye contact or initiate conversations and I have generally been ignoring them. I know it sounds mean, but I've had enough. I can't deal with clingy people. However, B is either EXTREMELY OBLIVIOUS, or they are just being really stubborn.   Also, even though I am ignoring B, I sit next to them in lots of lessons, and I also hang out in the same room as them at break and lunch so they always come and shuffle next to me! SO. INFURIATING. I don't want to change rooms, because then I won't be with my friends.   Another thing is that if I ignore B, I actually look like a loner. I ignore them by being antisocial in the corner doing my homework most of the time. I mean, everyone in my school already thinks I'm sort of weird child that studies all of the time, because I always seem to be studying at school (which is actually because I don't do anything at home). I also have to eat by myself at lunch, and having social anxiety definitely doesn't help with that. I know I shouldn't care about that, but it's hard not to.   I went off on a tangent there, didn't I?  So basically, what I'm trying to ask you is that should I completely completely ignore B (e.g. don't talk to them at all) or is that too mean? (Please don't suggest anything that says to try and be friends with them, because I don't want to do that. I want to make exciting friendships that I will remember, and not be stuck with... a boring person. Also, I'm 14. I don't know if that will help, but meh.)  B has turned into one of those people that... you just want to punch in the face for no reason. Do you sort of get what I mean?  Anyway, thanks for listening to this ranty thing.

"Me [28F] and my husband [29M] don't want children. His parents disagree with our decision so much that they want him to divorce me. For the past year, I've been weathering constant and continuous passive-aggressive attacks from my husband's parents. This issue has largely stemmed from our refusal to have children. They have also been contacting my parents, stating that they have issues with things we've said/done (mainly baby-related) and when we've tried bringing up the issue they lie and say they don't know what we're talking about and act like we're overreacting/being crazy/too sensitive.    Recently, after his parents did and said multiple things in a short period of time, my husband tried to confront them again (not for the first time). During the conversation, his parents said some truly horrible (and in my opinion, unforgivable) things about me: They said that my refusal to have children (which my husband totally supports, and agrees with as he also doesn't want children) made me an abusive, mentally ill, toxic person and told my husband to divorce me. They also gave him an ultimatum: them or me. The conversation was not received well by my husband, and he, of course, chose me. He's very angry with his parents as they've refused to listen to and respect his wishes.    However, they then decided to contact my parents to inform them of the mentally ill, toxic, abusive daughter that they'd raised because I wouldn't give them grandchildren. My parents, of course, were bewildered and tried to explain that we were happy, and that if we didn't want children, that decision should be respected. My husband's parents have not taken kindly to any of those suggestions.   My husband and I have been together for five years, and are coming up to being married for three. I have made it clear to everyone involved that I don't want children, and I never have. My husband agreed and has always supported and agreed with this decision.    At the moment, no one is really speaking to anyone, and I'm taking it rather hard. It's devastating to realise that his parents only ever liked or valued me as a 'person' when I was a uterus that was potentially giving them grandchildren. To hear from my parents that they're furious that I've disrupted the plans that they had for their son upsets me on so many levels that I can't even explain properly. I am no longer sleeping or eating properly. If it were me, and they weren't my husband's parents, I would cut them completely out of my life and never speak or associate with them again. While my husband feels like this is a great solution, I also feel that they are still his parents, and no matter how angry he currently is, he's going to want a relationship in the future. My question is - how do I do? How can I try and move forward with people who literally won't accept me unless I bear them grandchildren? How can I ever let go of the fact that they've made it abundantly clear to me, my husband, and my parents, that they view me as a uterus, not a person? I want to do the right thing by my husband and be supportive, but I'm completely lost in this situation, and I have honestly no idea how to move forward.       ---      **tl;dr**: My in-laws won't speak to me because I don't want children. They've threatened my husband with an ultimatum (them or me) and have insisted he leaves me immediately. What do I do? What advice is there for trying to move forward - especially with people who won't address me unless I give them grandchildren?

" Which I already knew, of course, but I am feeling pretty sorry for myself. Three and a half weeks ago I tore ligaments in my left knee, effectively curtailing most fun for the next several months. PMO!!! Anyway - the good news is that the bruising has now faded, the swelling is down, I can walk further than I could even a couple days ago. The bad news is that I am still wearing this silly brace and using a cane. The physiotherapist said I ""did a real number"" on my LCL and illotibial band (sp?) and can expect the healing process to take a while. It could have been worse right? I could have broken my leg or completely torn the LCL. It could have been my right leg and I wouldn't be able to drive.   So much for paddling this summer. At this point I still can't bend my knee far enough to get or out of a boat. I CAN still do weights though and I had a short somewhat successful trial on my indoor bike a couple days ago.

"Is it better to find out your love was a lie, or never to have loved at all? Last year, after 16 years of marriage, my wife says she never loved me, has never found me attractive (who can blame her), and doesn't think we've ever been right for each other. She only married me because she felt pressured from family and church to get married, and I was a ""good guy"", as she puts it. This crushed me. She has been everything to me. I have always loved her so much. My whole marriage has always been a fairy tale for me, it was everything I wanted. This was the girl of my dreams. I remember thinking when we were dating that it was too good to be true that any girl, especially one as amazing as my wife, would ever like me, since I'm shy, boring, and ugly. I guess I was right, it was too good to be true, and I should have trusted my gut and known it back then.  After a year of trying to find ways to connect with her, make myself more attractive to her, and hoping she'd love me, I've finally accepted that she never will. We are staying together for the kid's sake, and really for mine, what else would I do, no one else could ever love me, and I doubt I could ever really love anyone else the way I loved my wife. I've accepted that I will never have love. It makes me wonder, is it better to have thought I had love, and enjoyed it, only to find out it was lie, or never to have loved at all. At this point I really don't know.",1,better love lie loved all year year marriage wife say loved me attractive who blame her doe not think right other married felt pressured family church married good guy put it crushed me me loved much marriage fairy tale me wanted girl dream remember thinking dating good true girl especially amazing wife like me shy boring ugly guess right good true trusted gut known then year trying way connect her make attractive her hoping love me finally accepted will staying kid sake really mine do love me doubt really love way loved wife accepted love make wonder better thought love enjoyed it lie loved all point really not know

Stranger: but that allows us to do many things other animals cant, but its still kind of dreary  You: yes indeed. that's very true  You: it's hard to know what to do  Stranger: it really is  Stranger: too many options  Stranger: have you taken acid/shrooms before?

You: i can easily see myself living on the street haha  You: idk how to stay engaged  Stranger: living on the street because of not having money, or another reason?  Stranger: and you dont have to stay engaged with society a lot, it will always be there  You: just not giving enough of a shit to keep going  Stranger: just having whatever social circle youre comfortable with is enough usually  Stranger: true  You: also brb  Stranger: gotcha  You: so yeah what is your last piece of advice/Last words?  Stranger: id say just keep going, if things seem bad now just realize how many times youve reached a breaking point in your life, for whatever reason, and that youre still here lol  Stranger: also, just keep trying new things, and doing whatever, because what does it matter anyways?  Stranger: and if you seriously feel depressed, consider going to a doctor/therapist, as there could be less serotonin in your brain that the average person  Stranger: is that helpful at all lol  You: yes, it's nice to hear someone else who has thought about these things. and who can give an honest opinion  Stranger: i believe in u man  Stranger: u still there?

"Cheap gifts on the Receiver's side My friend and I are friends for about 5 years. We ended up going to different colleges, but kept in contact online. I think of them as my best friend, but i'm not sure if it is reciprocated.   Every year I stress about giving a good gift for their birthday and xmas. A gift too expensive makes them feel uncomfortable by setting expectations. A gift too cheap devalues our friendship and being on the receiving end feels terrible.   I purchased their birthday gift is about $12 (Lush soap), and the Christmas gift is about $8-10 (sweets). The price of the cards are not included.   They got me a small notepad that looked like it came from the dollar store for my birthday, and a couple stickers for Xmas. There was no card included or even a piece of paper that had my name on it.    Last year they got me a $15 gift with the receipt for my birthday. My gifts were around the same value (~$15).  I try not to place too much importance on the price tag, since it is the thought that counts, but their gift to me is really cheap (~$1-2), and looked like it was slapped together an hour before we met. I know they can afford to buy a gift. They buy coffee every couple days and bought lunch to the point where the staff remembered their order.   I accepted their gift, but it was really hard to avoid showing my disappointment. I honestly thought it would of been better if they just didn't give me a gift at all.  Is this a sign? Are they trying to tell me something or do they really think of me so little? I'm not sure what they are thinking or what should I do.   I know giving them a similarly cheap gift is an option, but I would rather know why they thought to give me this gift. I could also brush this off as a one time thing, but I think that this is not the case.

"Hi - I am ""dad"" a new member today (12/18/05) I like what I have seen so far and have a need to express myself and get some feedback from others. It is so hard to look at yourself..... especially when wearing the ""dark glasses"" of depression. I am a man in my late 40's - educated, with family- wife and two great, smart, loving kids, 15, and 13. I will try to summarize my story. About 5 yrs ago, I was laid off (tech field)...it was very hard to find another good position. We were so spoiled, I was making 70K - 100K in the past few years. We took it for granted. We built (4) new houses since 1989 - and did well. We enrolled our kids in a private Christian school (a high priority for us) THEN - My wife was in a auto accident and has spinal damage. She is ""mobile"", but has chronic pain. She is also suffering from depression. I managed to find another job, but it was a very dysfunctional place. I had to take a few leave-of absences - then I became ""pegged"" as a weak person. They eventually let me go for ""too many LOA's"" I'm paying $800 for COBRA - we can't do this forever....the pressure just adds to my anxiety. After seeing my psychiatrist, he took me through MANY medicines and even ECT's.... we tried for three years to find the most effective drug. Presently I take Zoloft, Cymbalta, Lamictal,Xanax & Valium for anxiety. I also have osteopenia (bone density loss), so I take, fosamax and Tylenol 4 (narcotic) for back/joint pain. Lastly, I use Soma for muscle strain. I don't know if the medicines are helping me or adding to the problem....? I admit I ""lean on"" some of the medicines as a coping mechanism. I have had so many situational events in the last few years, I suspect my depression is more environmentally caused...? I seem to ruminate on the ""bad events of the past"" too much. I am ""stuck"" - and just can't seem to get aggressive at my job hunt. We just sold our 6 bedroom house and are now living in a three bedroom apartment. I feel guilty that my family has to go through this. I know that I have skills and experience; but I don't have the self confidence - my ego is ""on the floor"". My sleep pattern is crazy and my appetite for food (and sex) is GONE. My wife is getting frustrated with me and doesn't always ""build me up""... Her depression has her down too.... With two depressed parents,it is very difficult to support each other. I feel ""stuck"" and don't know what to do....sometimes I just feel like giving up.... Any comments or thoughts would be appreciated!",1,hi dad new member today like seen far need express feedback others hard look yourself especially wearing dark glass depression man late educated family wife great smart loving kid try summarize story yr ago laid tech fieldit hard good position spoiled making k k past year took granted built new house did well enrolled kid private christian school a high priority u wife auto accident spinal damage mobile chronic pain suffering depression managed job dysfunctional place leaveof absence pegged weak person eventually let too loa is paying cobra foreverthe pressure just add anxiety seeing psychiatrist took medicine ect is tried year effective drug presently zoloft cymbalta lamictalxanax valium anxiety osteopenia bone density loss take fosamax tylenol narcotic backjoint pain lastly use soma muscle strain not know medicine helping adding problem admit lean on medicine coping mechanism situational event year suspect depression environmentally caused ruminate bad event past much stuck just aggressive job hunt just sold bedroom house living bedroom apartment feel guilty family this know skill experience not self confidence ego on floor sleep pattern crazy appetite food and sex gone wife getting frustrated doe not build up depression too depressed parentsit difficult support other feel stuck not know dosometimes just feel like giving up comment thought appreciated

"21/F/US Looking for a long term friend Hello! My name is Mousey and I live in Georgia. I’ve been very busy with school, work, and starting my own business. I’m looking for people I can have serious connections with. I used to have a best friend in the UK whom I talked with every day all day. So, time zones don’t really bother me.  I have an open mind, and I love sharing thoughts and ideas with people. I love learning new things (and since I have an awful memory- you can teach me the same thing three times and I’ll be excited every time lol)  I am currently studying to be a middle grades teacher in the fields of science and social sciences.  I also have a chinchilla and a hedgehog. They’re wonderful babies and I’ve had them for a long time now (they’re my heart)  I am pretty blunt and open to receive and give advice. I really want someone who i can share my daily life with, and they can share theirs with me. Funny pictures, goofing off, hard experiences we encounter, the whole nine. I miss having that connection with someone.  I’m not looking for a specific gender, age, or region. I just wanna spend my time and experiences with someone who will become special to me!(:  I’m not sure if this helps or hurts me here- but, I’m not really into anime or gaming (I thought I would throw that in there because of the people on here seem to enjoy those things) A lot of people also tend to be into computer science, and that’s okay! But, I’m going to tell you now that I’m pretty technologically impaired so I won’t be able to hold a conversation about it with you :P  If you’re okay will all of these things then just shoot me a message, I can’t wait to meet you!(:",0,fus looking long term friend hello mousey live georgia busy school work starting business looking people connection with used best friend uk talked day day so time zone not really bother me open mind love sharing thought idea people love learning new thing and awful memory teach thing time excited time lol currently studying middle grade teacher field science social science chinchilla hedgehog wonderful baby long time they heart pretty blunt open receive advice really want share daily life with share theirs me funny picture goofing off hard experience encounter nine miss having connection someone not looking specific gender age region just wanna spend time experience special me not sure help hurt here but not really anime gaming i thought throw people enjoy thing lot people tend computer science okay but going tell pretty technologically impaired not able hold conversation okay thing just shoot message wait meet you

"I'm a daca recipient and I fucking hate it. I was born in Mexico and brought to the US when I was 3. This of course means I'm one of those ""nasty illegals"" everyone seems to hate.  My goal has always been success. Ever since I was a kid I daydreamed of owning a mansion with fancy gates, a huge lawn, a big pool. This was always my goal. I wasn't going to accept living in poverty like my parents or having an ""average"" life. So I worked hard for it. I was always top of my class, I was on the dean's honor list in college, I started (and failed) my first few businesses, joined clubs, went to a lot of events to meet people, and landed an internship. I was even in the middle of starting my next business. I also got my credit score up to almost 800 and started funding my retirement/investment account.  Because my whole life has been focused on success, I attempted suicide a few times when I found out I was illegal and couldn't even go to college in high school. Obviously they all failed. However in 2012, the year before I graduated, Obama passed daca. Because I had been here since I was a toddler, was going to finish school, and didn't have even a single misdemeanor, I was able to get a social security number, a work permit, a driver's license, open investment accounts, and received protection from deportation.  Now Trump has ended it. The final decision will be made in early August, but it's most likely going to be rescinded. What am I supposed to do then? Just fucking accept losing everything? Everything I worked towards will have been for nothing. Even if daca continues, am I supposed to just keep living in fear of it ending again forever? I'm losing all my fucking hair stressing over this. I've had a cold for months that hasn't gone away, and everything hurts.   I can't even talk to anyone about this. Everyone just tells me to man up and work some shitty job picking fruit in the fields. No one understands that I actually have goals in life. I refuse to accept a life where I work 60 hours a week, breaking down my body, for $30k a year with no room for advancement and living in fear every day. I've never been fond of life in the first place. The only thing that ever gave me happiness was growing my net worth, and pretty soon I won't even be able to do that. Why shouldn't I end it all at that point?  That's it. I needed to rant. I'm sorry if I sound like a spoiled brat.  TL:DR: I rely on daca to have an even somewhat decent life. It's being taken away.

"I can't seem to be happy with my current life - only the future So I was diagnosed with mood swings/mild depression quite a while ago, and have been on a small dose of Fluoxetine (Prozac) most of my life now.  Based on looking at objective measures, I should be feeling pretty content right now, but I can't seem to be happy about it, and only about the things that I hope I'll work towards in the future.  I guess for example - I've lost a little over 30 pounds since February, the first significant time I've actually lost weight, and I'm now no longer medically obese... but I still just feel fat and haven't been able to feel anything good about the weight I've actually lost.  I have a great job, and am just about to finish paying off all my loans, but I don't feel any accomplishment in that either. I keep thinking maybe I'll feel good when I have enough to put down a down-payment on a house, but I doubt that will be the case.  I have a bunch of great friends, but I'm tired of being single again. I know that I should just focus on the good things right now, but it's not seeming to be any consolation.  My faith life has been doing pretty good recently too, especially compared to the past, but I still feel like a shitty person a lot.   I dunno, I know that so many other people are having a rough time and I should be happy with how things are going, but I'm just down right now.",1,happy current life future diagnosed mood swingsmild depression quite ago small dose fluoxetine prozac life now based looking objective measure feeling pretty content right now happy it thing hope work future guess example lost little pound february significant time actually lost weight longer medically obese just feel fat not able feel good weight actually lost great job just finish paying loan not feel accomplishment either thinking maybe feel good downpayment house doubt case bunch great friend tired single again know just focus good thing right now not consolation faith life doing pretty good recently too especially compared past feel like shitty person lot dunno know people having rough time happy thing going just right now

"Post graduation depression is real. It's been 5 months after graduating from college and I've never been depressed more than ever. Unemployed and feeling worthless.

"I have just now realized now, after 24+ years of experiencing it, that what I've suffered from is depression. Soon after that, I spoke to my dad about it, and learned he'd been on AD's for over 10 years now, and he said he probably could have used them from the time he was about 15 years old on. He also said my paternal grandmother's side of the family was all just like us (my dad and I are almost carbon copies of each other, except he's always seemed much more ""perfect"" to me than I am.  ) He also said my oldest half brother is also on AD's. I also talked to my oldest daughter (who's 21 year-old), and she said she's been on AD's a few times too. I can say also that I learned many years after his death that my maternal grandfather experienced severe depression before I was born. He had shock therapy multiple times it seems...but I don't know if his problems were entirely from the extreme horrors he experienced in WWII, or a combination of that plus other problems. When I knew him he was always a sweet loving, rather quiet, man (and my favorite person in the world other than my dad.) My dad said he never associated my problems with depression (of course, neither did I), but now it all clicks. I wish I'd known all this when I was younger, that depression hadn't had the stigma it had back in the 1970s & 80s, and that I could have gotten treatment back then. Of course, if I had, I wouldn't have the same life I have now, so I guess I can't complain about that (and honestly wouldn't change a thing...I wouldn't risk losing my kids or what I've accomplished, no matter how crooked and difficult the path as been). But I will definitely watch my young kids now for signs of depression (especially my 4 year-old daughter, since she seems to have a similar personality to my dad and I). If I see it, they will get the treatment they need immediately! So in that sense I think this is a blessing...knowledge is power.",1,just realized now year experiencing it suffered depression soon that spoke dad it learned ad year now said probably used time year old on said paternal grandmother family just like my dad carbon copy other perfect am said oldest half brother ad is talked oldest daughter who yearold said ad time too say learned year death maternal grandfather experienced severe depression born shock therapy multiple time seemsbut not know problem entirely extreme horror experienced wwii combination plus problem knew sweet loving quiet man and favorite person world dad dad said associated problem depression of course did i click wish known younger depression not stigma s s gotten treatment then course had not life now guess complain and honestly not change thingi not risk losing kid accomplished matter crooked difficult path been definitely watch young kid sign depression especially yearold daughter similar personality dad i it treatment need immediately sense think blessingknowledge power

"Hi everyone, I am new to this site and my name is Elie. I am a 38-year-old married mother of three girls and one angel baby boy who was born still 10/30/2003. My children's ages are 18 years old, 15 years old then it would have been Conner Charles. When we lost Conner due to an underlying infection and when I had the amniocentesis the infection got to Conner and he died a month later. That was very devastating to us but I have had a lot of support with an infant grief group in our area. After we lost Conner three months later we got pregnant with Charlene and she is so beautiful. Anyway things were going good (oh I forgot to mention the fact I remarried my ex husband. We were divorced for 14 years and we got back together). One day when the baby was 11 months old my husband accidentally spilled hot coffee onto Charlene's leg and she had a blanket sleeper on so she wasn't that bad. It was bad enough but because of the way the burn looked (due to the absorption of the stupid hot coffee) the doctor had her removed from our care until they could further decide if the baby was abused. I was dumbfounded; I have known this doctor for 17 hears with my girls Marissa and Jessica, so how dare he. I was so upset, but we have a DSS worker in our lives because of my middle daughter who has mental retardation, she is in a residential home because of her behaviors which in a way was excellent for us. Our worker seen and knew Charlene before the foster care and then when she finally saw her at foster care she did everything in her power to get the baby back and we did six days later. We are constantly in and out of court now because of this and then my husband was feeding the baby oatmeal and I was warning him to be careful she flails her arms, well she flailed and knocked the spoon out of his hand and the clump of oatmeal landed on her face ... we cleaned her up not noting anything bad as she didn't cry or nothing she wanted to eat. She ended up with a blister on her cheek in the spot that the oatmeal touched. We almost lost Charlene again. I went into DSS and said my husband was no longer going to be in charge of the baby and they felt better and I also said he wants parenting classes and they liked that idea. But this is my problem, how do I get passed this. I have a counselor already but you can never have too much support so I came to this web site. I can't even make love with my husband anymore. I resent him for putting me through this when I have been the most careful mother around. We also live with his mother because financially things are tight and right now its better we do because DSS notes it is a very supportive environment and I have a lot of help which I do but I can't leave otherwise I will have DSS up my back quite often. My husband feels that sex is the cure all to depression, he keeps hounding me and hounding me and I just don't want sex. When we first got back together this second time around things were awesome and we had so much fun but then we lost Conner, then had Charlene and then these burns and losing her and going to court. I have no say whatsoever even in my own room which depresses me but soon I will try and figure out how to get out of this. All I know is my husband better respect my wishes, I just can't make love at the moment. The last time was four weeks ago. Ok that's about it for now, that's about the main stuff I am dealing with for now.

"Clingy friend So I have a friend who lives pretty far from me. Let me preface this by saying that he has expressed a romantic interest in me, but I am not interested in men, and have told him so. He helped me through a difficult time in my life, and I have thanked him many times for it. I have tried to do the same for him on multiple occasions, but it seems like the more attention I give him, the more he wants. I do not feel that we need to have hour long phone discussions and 26 text messages on a daily basis - I don’t talk to ANYONE that much. I started ignoring a text or two here and there, hoping he would catch on. He did, apparently, and we just went about 3 weeks with no contact.   Had he sent me a normal text today, I would have answered. Instead, he sent a passive-aggressive “Ever since you’re feeling better, you never bother to call me.”   This is simply NOT true. I have called him many times when he said he needed to talk, even though I hate talking on the phone. I just simply can’t take this level of neediness. I’m not sure how to explain to him that constant contact drives me nuts and I need space. Every time I try to explain this to him, he seems to feel that it was designed as a personal attack against him.   Any thoughts on this? I’m not going to text him back until I’ve had some time to think about the right thing to say.

"A song of fire and ice Hey everyone. I'm on mobile so pardon my typos which will happen. I'd like to take this time to thank anyone who reads this as well as giving a shout out to anyone currently struggling with depression. I have a long history with Type 1 Bipolar Disorder. Although that isn't necessarily depression in itself patients who are Bipolar are bound to eventually oscillate into that emotional polarity.   To give a quick summary here is what happened to me: I grew up incredibly wealthy. My Father was an ex alcoholic. My Mother died when I was 13 and my Father went back to drinking to cope with the loss of his wife (my Mother). My Father became suicidal and threw everything we had away. We went bankrupt and I went to live with my Brother across the country.   My Brothers wife left him shortly after I moved in. He became suicidal as well, ended up hospitalized. I moved back across the country again to live with my then pseudo homeless Father.   One day my Father shows up to my school drunk, gets arrested, I am taken in by the state and put into foster care. I end up living with an incredibly poor hispanic family and eat almost nothing everyday. I have no bed. I sleep on the floor.    The state then places me in an incredibly religious home where i essentially become a slave and i cook and clean nonstop for an extremely wealthy catholic couple. They don't like me Because I liked hard rock.    My third stay I end up living in a small apartment with a woman who was good at hiding her side prostitution gig and methamphetamine addiction.   After all the years my Father gets his life back under control. He begins dating a wealthy woman who isn't a fan of me. He takes prolonged stays at her home about 40 miles away. He would visit the house to restock it with food, pay the bills, then leave again. During this time i saw my Father maybe 15 times a year. Each encounter was brief and lasted less than 30 minutes.   During this I still went to school, cooked, did my laundry, and did kind of normal kid stuff.   The point of this story is I am an adult now who is married. I am a software engineer. I am financially stable. Regardless of how dark it gets it is possible to make it out on top. You have to focus and be strong. Do whatever you need to do to survive.   If anyone has any questions or would like to chat, need advice, whatever please let me know. I currently do volunteer work to aid people who suffer from Bipolar Disorder as well as others like ADHD or OCD. I also, accidentally, mentor Fatherless children on Xbox Live (strange, I know).   Its not easy out there and world and parents sometimes forget how hard it is being a teen. No judgement. I hope everyone has a good night (or day, depending where you're at).",1,song ice hey everyone mobile pardon typo happen like time thank read giving shout currently struggling depression long history type bipolar disorder not necessarily depression patient bipolar bound eventually oscillate emotional polarity quick summary happened me grew incredibly wealthy father ex alcoholic mother died father went drinking cope loss wife my mother father suicidal threw away went bankrupt went live brother country brother wife left shortly moved in suicidal well ended hospitalized moved country live pseudo homeless father day father show school drunk get arrested taken state foster care end living incredibly poor hispanic family eat everyday bed sleep floor state place incredibly religious home essentially slave cook clean nonstop extremely wealthy catholic couple not like liked hard rock stay end living small apartment woman good hiding prostitution gig methamphetamine addiction year father get life control begin dating wealthy woman not fan me take prolonged stay home mile away visit house restock food pay bill leave again time saw father maybe time year encounter brief lasted minute went school cooked did laundry did kind normal kid stuff point story adult married software engineer financially stable regardless dark get possible make top focus strong need survive question like chat need advice let know currently volunteer work aid people suffer bipolar disorder like adhd ocd also accidentally mentor fatherless child xbox live strange know not easy world parent forget hard teen judgement hope good night or day depending at
"Family problems Hello, I want to talk about things in my household now, and maybe get some opinions on it. Okay, so my sister is 22, she's the oldest. I'm 14, the middle child, and my brother who's 12 is the youngest. Our dad works abroad and comes back a few times a year. But we talk on phone almost everyday. My sister studies in a university and comes back usually on weekends and then maybe some other days depending on her schedule.  When she comes back everyone in the house starts fighting and she's the problem. When she's home, everything we do is wrong. We were ""raised"" wrong. Mom ""spoils"" us. Mom doesn't ""love"" her. We ""don't want her here"". And when my mom says that she causes the problems she bursts into tears, goes to her room, cries for a bit and leaves to her boyfriends house because ""she feels loved there"". And that's how it always goes. She comes back, says that my brother doesn't do anything in this is house and that he's a spoiled brat, fights over something, bursts into tears and leaves. She is very emotional. When she accuses my brother of something and he calls her some kind of name she immediately stars crying like it's the end of the world.  Last night she texted my mom, saying that she raised us poorly and that mom doesn't love her. She said that she's gonna be leaving our home and won't come back because ""we don't want her there"".  Of course, me, as  the peace maker in the family, wrote her a huge message about how she is wrong, how we actually love her is just that she doesn't see it and everything else. She wrote back, about how I'm wrong, about how my brother is spoiled and again, everything else. I will agree, my brother is the youngest and he can be a brat. But that's the point, he's the youngest. And I don't see how you can make a problem out of everything. Like dude chill oml you're not dying. Guys, how the hell do we make her understand. Or maybe she should leave? Get some time alone? Maybe understand herself better? But she's an almost adult, she should be the smart one, she one that understands.",0,family problem hello want talk thing household now maybe opinion it okay sister oldest middle child brother youngest dad work abroad come time year talk phone everyday sister study university come usually weekend maybe day depending schedule come house start fighting problem home wrong raised wrong mom spoil u mom doe not love her do not want here mom say cause problem burst tear go room cry bit leaf boyfriend house she feel loved there go come back say brother doe not house spoiled brat fight something burst tear leaf emotional accuses brother call kind immediately star cry like end world night texted mom saying raised poorly mom doe not love her said gonna leaving home not come we not want there course me peace maker family wrote huge message wrong actually love just doe not else wrote back wrong brother spoiled again else agree brother youngest brat point youngest not make problem everything like dude chill oml not dying guy hell make understand maybe leave time alone maybe understand better adult smart one understands
"My boring sob story Family members told me all the time that being an adult is shit and I should make the most of being a kid. So when depression hit me I thought it was normal, but it didn’t feel “right.” I wasn’t upset all the time, it was just like a flat misery sort of feeling.  Things started to feel odd for me, certain sounds and smells and silly things like the wind of my face felt wrong. Like they’d be toned down somehow. Eventually I became completely disconnected from my emotions, save for the occasional moment when I actually find something funny. I’ve been on two types of medication and had therapy too, neither of which did anything for me.   I didn’t notice myself become so gradually withdrawn from everything. Now going to the shop or getting the bus is something I’d rather not do. Things I’d do every day. My social life went backwards as well as my social skills. Now I’m afraid to talk to people. I literally reject girls I’m interested in on the spot, before I even have chance to fuck it up myself. Things that I would do without thinking now take encouragement and energy.   Then came the cynicism. Belief that nobody out there was pure and everything they did was for their own personal gain. Suppose it’s true in a sense but I wish I didn’t have this “paint everybody with the same brush” mindset. It’s hard to believe I’m the same person at times. It’s been 7 years now and I’ve had enough. Just dunno what to do. I feel like I’ve tried everything. Can’t help but feel I’m partly responsible, for buying into the shit I told myself.

"I feel like a bit of a jerk posting here when I haven't been around to support any of you, so I hope someone out there is feeling generous tonight.  My background story consists on being depressed on and off for the past 12 years or so, I am now 20. Finally started antidepressants in October. By December the side effects were not stopping and I stopped taking them because I always felt sick to my stomach .... and a person can't work that way. So I stopped them .... I have not been to the doctor since and have been feeling on top of the world.  Even my co-workers have noticed a big difference and my manager has been giving me a lot of opportunity at work (training new hires, being on committees etc)  But ....  then today hit,. like a ton of bricks to the head.  I'm tired, cranky, I cant stop crying and am trying very hard not to cut myself. I hate everything and am just beside myself.  I don't know what to do. I have the energy from when i felt great but I feel like crud and have no where to constructively place this energy.  I don't think I can go back to my doctor ..... she'll just tell me to take the drugs and stop whining.  I'm not so sure I'm depressed. Maybe I'm normal and it's the rest of the world messed up? That's a whole other story though.  Can anyone here honestly say that medications work and you can be a functional person? I mean ... will this ever end so I can get some peace?  Any opinions or insight would be appreciated.

Everyone else with us started ganging up on me saying stuff like “This is why nobody likes you” and then my other friend comes over and tells them to keep me in the room (Theater stuff). Now everyone seems fine with me but it really upset me and I don’t know what I can do to change it. They said I ask the wrong questions and I feel like I just want to be included.

"Post-Graduation Depression I recently graduated from college, and over the past couple of months I’ve grown increasingly depressed. I feel this profound sense of loss and it feels as if the color has drained from the world. What’s shocking to me is that I honestly hated college - I was either working or studying 24x7. I rarely had a single moment for myself or friends and was constantly exhausted and anxious. Now, I have a great job, live with my girlfriend, have almost no debt (thanks to working so much in college), and live in my ideal area. My life is comparatively so much better, but I feel this knot in my stomach as if I just finished a good book or beat the story of a video game and now I’m finally seeing how much of myself I’ve given up to get to where I am. Life feels devoid of adventure and I feel like I have no passion left. I’ve struggled with depression for a long time, but it’s weird to have it catch up with me at the point in my life where past sacrifices were meant to mitigate it.

"Went through tough times, friends weren't there, but I still want them in my life. I have 2 best friends from high school since we were young. Long story short, we were the best of friends, had a great friendship and were really good to each other. We are all 19 now, and I went through a bad time the end of last year, my brother was shot in the shoulder as a accident at work, and had alot of issues with my childhood come up. The only difference with my friends and I is that I grew up in a completely different way then they did , I was raised in foster care, that was tough, I grew up poor and had many bad things happen during that time, on the other hand they had very loving parents and a great home.  They dont seem to understand some of those things and find it hard to understand why I am the way I am sometimes I need my space and need to be by myself, Being in a foster care that had terrible people in it, I never had celebrated birthdays since a young age, like 3 and when i was 15 was when I found out that they are special days , and so when birthdays do happen I may come across as blunt? Or dont make a massive deal out of it for them sometimes, and they take all of that as I am being blunt and they seem to move away from me and dont make plans with me, same as when my brother was shot, I was a mess, initially they were there for me but eventually they drifted off.   But as always we came back together and were just like old times,  I know and they know Im a person who likes to deal with things on my own, but I just feel like a burden in their perfect world.

"Apologise and make up or move on? Sorry it’s long, but I really need advice.  I’m a girl and he’s a gay guy so there’s definitely no feelings other than friendship. He only invites me to clubs occasionally, never to hang out. I felt used &amp; that he only invites me to pay for his drinks. Most of the time he ditches me to go off with random guys. One night I was going home early and he said ‘no you’re staying at mine tonight’, but within half an hour met some guy and said he was going home with him instead- and that didn’t even end up happening because the guy had a boyfriend, so he ditched me for no reason. He doesn’t even text me, because apparently he’s a bad communicator. On the flip side he constantly refers to me as ‘one of his best friends’, tells me he loves me and wants me to be his maid of honour one day.  He had a potential STI scare recently and asked if I’d go to the clinic with him. I ran out of my house and across the city to sit with him for 4 hours, didn’t even have time to brush my teeth! While we were waiting I told him this was the first time we’ve hung out outside of a club, and he said ‘it’s not my fault I’m busy’. I didn’t show it but I was really disappointed. He’s a student (as am I), not the president. He hangs out with his other friends constantly, stays at their house for a week at a time OR MORE, but has the nerve to tell me he’s too busy for me.  A week later he invited me to the club again and we left and walked to the bus stop together. He got on his bus and left me alone and drunk, again. It’s also strange because he’d always invite me to stay at his after nights out, but that randomly stopped a couple of months ago. Anyway, this time I had enough and ignored his messages after that. He then invited me to the cinema and I said yes. On the day I saw that he was with his other friends instead. He called me at night and said he was ‘tired and sick’ but we could meet 2 days later. I just said ‘ok’ because I didn’t want to confront him and fall out.   On the day we were meeting he text me at 5pm and asked ‘are you still up for the cinema?’ and following advice from my friends, I said ‘no thanks’ and told him it’s unbelievable that after everything hes done he chose to blow off hanging out with me to hang out with other friends, and lied about it. I also said he’s not busy, he’s just a shit friend. He said he agrees that I’m a better friend than him but he never hangs out with anyone sober and he’s trying his best.

"Is this kind of family interaction normal? Hi all, I hope you can help me out. Is what my dad said to me normal?   Backstory: I'm 24f...married...have a toddler. I was texting my mom today about several things (husband can get ribs on sale at work for them, MIL invited me and my mom to a play, things my MIL said that irritated me...etc. She was on break at work). At the end, she mentioned my dad is home sick today. Maybe I should call him. So I call him and ask him jokinging why he's sick. He said he has the flu or a cold or something. He stayed home yesterday too. Then he mumbled something offhand about how mom wasn't going to tell me because I never ask them how they are.   Do normal parents do/say stuff like that? Won't tell their kid that one if them are sick because they don't ask how they are? It makes me feel terrible but also manipulated. It's not like my mom has never given me the silent treatment because she thinks I don't call enough.   The thing is...I HATE small talk. I never ask anyone how they are. It feels fake and wrong to me(maybe because I don't think most people actually care about me). They(anyone) can tell me if they don't feel good. I wouldn't wait til asked to tell my close family/friends if I don't feel well. I also have social anxiety and anxiety in general. These kinds of comments make me want to call them even less. I already feel judged every time I call my mom. And I still get anxious every time my dad calls...thinking he is calling to yell or something. I just CAN'T ask. It literally feel impossible. Like I physically can't get the words out.   Comments? Anything to make feel better? I feel down and don't like myself. I don't have any friends to talk to about it either.

"I lost my father to a sudden and completely unexpected heart attack two weeks ago. I've been up and down, but right now I'm at a loss. What are some strategies you'd employ(secular wise, i'm non religious). I suffer from severe anxiety(GAD) and severe depression. xpost /r/griefsupport I'm going to seek counselling by the way very soon. My Dad's service hasn't happened yet. I was planning after that to start up again but with this added part.  So yeah, my dad showing no signs of it, had a massive heart attack on the 14th and passed away on the 16th at 73 years old. I realize people's times do come, and he had health problems(As far as we knew, no heart disease, had been checked out) but he didn't smoke or drink and he lost a lot of weight and took care of himself for the most part. He was slowing down, but no more then an older person would.  To say it was a shock would be putting it mildly. I ugly cried in front of him and his hospital bed several times. I'm just so broken up for my mom and my family. Of course, me too. But my Mom and Dad were married for 45 years. And although it wasn't perfect, they had a true love. And I have such a close relationship with my mother. So when her heart is breaking it's hard for me to see. I sponge it. I feel that pain.  I've also unfortunately had to deal with siblings who are dealing with this tragedy by lashing out and trying to put themselves ahead of myself and my brother. (My sister and other brother). And that's been super difficult. They've said some ugly things that I'm trying to look past at the current moment.  Anyways, I just wanted to know other then counselling, if there's anything you feel that might be of use to me and my brain to move forward without Dad. Depression has creeped in the last few days with the grief to give it a double whammy. Also had a massive panic attack yesterday as well, which I expected but it never prepares you for it.  Anyways. Thank you. Sorry if I seem scrambled.

"Need to talk and I have nobody. Hey all. Just need to talk, really struggling right now and trying to dig out of it. Not really sure what else to do.   Pattern of behaviour:  Wake up in the morning with immediate feelings of depression and loneliness. Acute feelings of being alone in bed, uncomfortable. Become compelled to flip through Bumble, Tinder because I feel a need to try and immediately correct the problem. I never (and I mean never) match. Have to fight urges to immediately abuse addictions like porn and weed. Sometimes do, sometimes don’t. Prepare for work, fight off feelings of sadness about ex-girlfriend and situation it puts me in. Fight the urge to blame her for the failure of the relationship even though I logically know I’m wrong or that’s not fair. She just left to pursue school and had to move on, she didn’t do anything to me. Fight feelings of rejection and feelings of inadequacy in my value to others even though there’s no reason to feel that here.   Walk to work, continue to fight with anger issues re: relationships and validation. Sometimes frustration stems from lack of work success but more often than not it’s physical appearance issues and relationship issues. I get caught in a loop being mad at her and being mad at myself and my capacity to deal with being alone.   Auto-pilot at work. Able to do job easily, so lack of focus is a non-issue. I spend too much time on Facebook and other social media looking for outlets to expand my social network and friends. Find it very difficult to do so without appearing over-anxious or creepy and new opportunities rarely prevent themselves. Sometimes  Imarket business and contact clients/potential clients. Sometimes a boost comes from having success here, but often the lack thereof is equally esteem damaging.   Go home, usually bus. Already tired. Immediately engage addictions, usually beer and weed. Start watching TV or playing games and rarely stop until bed time. I'll leave easy tasks like cleaning dishes, etc for weeks. Continual evasion of solving problems, instead opting to rely on substances to either forget or balance my feelings of sadness. Occasionally I have friends over, but many of them use substances as well or are in similar life situations so finding solace in these encounters is limited. Furthermore, they are my friends of many years and represent a kind of social stagnation.   At night I’m usually in bed by 10, not because I’m out of things to do, but because I’m either drunk or bored.   On weekends I’m lucky if I do anything outside of what I do immediately after work. I rarely feel compelled to do anything. If I get invited to a bar, I end up going and feeling alienated from everyone and ‘out-of-place’. Most of the time, I just feel too tired to join my friends, but I also feel a lack of motivation because I’m sure it’ll just be the same crowd—and it appears their lives keep moving while mine does not.  I am behind on adulthood. I have only recently acquired a driver’s license, I just renewed my glasses prescription and only just started living on my own. I have to get my teeth taken care of and they are a source of stress and physical pain (still have wisdom teeth at 34). I have the habits of a teenager. I smoke copious amounts of weed, I drink daily and I don’t pursue my interests or goals. I know the right course of action most of the time, but I actively ignore it because the amount required to get healthy is just too much. I have spent a great majority of my life single and most of my relationships aside from a few gems have been tumultuous, emotional rollercoasters. More often than not,  Despite all these things I feel undervalued in my society. I think of myself as smart, funny and confident in my skills, but I feel that the rest of the world doesn’t care and doesn’t see those as appealing. I feel like without looks and an academic education, you can only accomplish so much and that people’s standards are so high that competition for a good role in society is unlikely. I feel unable to compete when the above issues prevent me from succeeding. Motivation to do anything is lowered by the lack of acceptance in general, the feeling that I should be acceptable the way I am but am not, and my inability to seem to control that situation. It doesn’t help that on the face of it, most people will tell me that I seem like a “catch”, an incredibly high-value person with lots to offer—except that none of that seems to translate to my life, emotional attachments or stability.  I'm just lost.

" After I followed a link to the ""I Love Bees"" blog from  urlLink www.penny-arcade.com  I decided it was about time I actually started my own blog. About six months ago I had started an online journal, but at the time I was drowning myself in Smirnoff frequently (daily) and lacked the motivation to sit down and write. I think now I have the time and mind to actually keep up with this.  When signing up for my blog, I could not for the life of me think of a name for it that would be worthy. I stopped right there. If I don't have a decent name for my blog, what's the point? I figured, something would come to me eventually and it did. I saw Garden State last night (Go see it, it's fantastic!) and it gave me the name for my blog. The movie sums up all the thoughts and feelings going through my mind at this moment in life, thus, my Infinite Abyss will be this blog. I hope you enjoy it.

There are those who might really care about you and want to help but they have zero clue how depression works and their mindset is basically to tell you to get over it because that's what they do.

I should be grateful I have people that care about me I know, but its genuinely not that helpful when they brush aside how shit I really feel because they don't see a reason for me to feel like this other than just being weak.

"I seem to have depression the worst, first thing in the morning lately.  Just started with a new pdoc after 7 months. with another pdoc since this latest episode occured.  My old pdoc thought I could have a mild bipolar disorder but wasn't sure.  My 20 mg of prozac had stopped working after several years of keeping me stable.  She started me on lamictal and I am now up to 100 mg / day.  Stopped the prozac in early January and got worse, but not right away.  I was having a good week / bad week type pattern depending on where I was in my menstrual cycle while I was on the prozac.  I have battled depression on and off for 20 years.  Particularly bad postpartum and this recent episode.  I am 41 years old and haven't felt this bad since I had my daughter 8 years ago.   My new doctor thinks I don't have an ounce of bipolar and that I am just in a depression (I tend to agree with her).  We decided together to add Lexapro to the mix and see if that helps me level out all the days of the month.  I have been on it almost 2 weeks patiently waiting for some results - I am well aware of the waiting game.  I am also taking Xanax XR in the evenings for sleep and to avert morning anxiety.  I take my Lamictal in the morning and a very small (half of the lowest dose of xanax) as well.  I seem to get moving and can be quite productive during my day after I take the Lamictal / xanax - don't know if this is a placebo effect??  My question is, has anyone experienced this a.m. depression that seems to lift a bit later in the day?  Also, does anyone take Lamictal for unipolar depression?  The last thing I want is to be taking too much of anything and further putting off good health.  Starting to wonder if the Xanax XR in the evening is giving me this early morning dread??

" Well for someone with an abundance of thoughts spilling out of her head, I'm having difficulty committing to writing them down. Maybe it's the heat, as we usually experience a much shorter summer . It's not as green and lush here as in previous summers. This global warming isn't just talk.      People are coming and going in my household. My youngest son Kevin has just returned from his week long summer camp. I was abit horrified to find that he had certainly packed along a visually controversial book for a christian based camp. I'm glad they didn't find it in his possession. They might've freaked out just looking at it, (Diablo, legacy of blood). He's almost fourteen and plays Diablo on the computer all the time. It looks like a skeletal grim reaper on the cover of it. Ahh, the joys of a young teenage boy. The sounds of his drumkit pounding on a summer's day, with our windows open for the neighbourhood to enjoy. The young teenage 'friend that is a girl' that comes to call, all giggles and cute.      My 'middle child', Kimberly, now twenty and working hard is two weeks away from flying back east to start her third year of university in Toronto. The anguish she'll experience to leave her boyfriend behind, once again. Been there, done that, but what does a Mom know. I think she's got it made, with her girlfriend in a great apartment downtown Toronto. Two girls going to school and experiencing life in a big city. Wish I had that opportunity at that age. What's the rush for commitment? I don't know too many young guys with a game plan at twenty. And that is alright, so they take abit longer to figure it out. Why botch them up forcing them to make decisions concerning women at such a young age? But I am the Mom, what do I know about such things. Hmmm.      I have one more 'child'. At this age, my least stressful one. Trevor, he's twenty-two. He's working full time, does apprenticeship training six weeks out of the year, he's doing OK, not too much to worry about there. He's a happy guy. His PIA days were when he was about 14- 16. He's got a very nice girlfriend, keeps him in line.

"Should I reach out to her or leave it alone? (TL;DR) I had a friend and it ended pretty bad IMO. I’ve really missed her over the past couple years and I thought about re-befriending her but I’m not sure.  I’ll start with the good things about our past friendship: -she was pretty sweet to me. Very supportive of most things. -She stood up for me when like half the school picked on me for having a 2 foot bright orange Mohawk. -She tried to keep me from dating a pretty Toxic boy (but at the time I was young and wouldn’t listen) -She made me walk around the entire town with her frequently (helped me lose the weight I’d gained and build some muscle in my legs) -She was for the most part a great friend  Now the bad: -since I didn’t listen about Toxic boy, we ended up dating for about 4 years. He’s said he didn’t like her cause when they went to school together she flirted with him and when he kissed her in the hallway she told the school he sexually assaulted her and got him sent to juvie. Now while I’m not gonna go into the semantics of whether or not it was s. Assault in anyway, I will say she fully apologized to him and me for it a while back but he made me tell her that we didn’t accept her apology and to “fuck off” -She borrowed a couple box sets of shows from me around this time, those sets were given to me by favorite aunt when I was young. When I wanted them back she claimed she couldn’t find them. Almost a year went by of her “looking” for them, and I told her (mostly from Toxic boy pushing me to) if she didn’t find them by the end of the week I was going to call the police and report her for stealing them. She gave them back to me a couple days later (scratched, though I don’t know if she knew they were scratched) -I also shortly dated, and quickly broke up with one of her brothers last year (our personalities didn’t really mix well) but I don’t think she holds it against me  The manority of us breaking up was due to Toxic Boy (he’s he was toxic, he tried to fuck literally any girl friend I introduced him to) pushing me into breaking up with her, telling me she was the toxic one cause she didn’t support our relationship and cause of the juvie thing from years before.  In 2015 she reached out to me on Facebook saying: “Hey i know your probably the last person you wanna hear from but, i just wanted to say im sorry for all the bullshit that happened when i was still in school. If you don't wanna be friends thats understandable, just know thats not me anymore, and im sorry” Which, of course, Toxic boy made me to reply incredibly rudely to and our friend ship just kind of died.

" My name is Crystal  My life story is not all that good. You may not like what I say. My father left me when I was 7. After that my mom found a boyfriend named Jim. My mom and dad are still married to this day. Still to this day there is fighting . When I was 13 my dad called and started telling me what to do with my life. But I told him off and said ""you was not in my life so don't try to tell me what to do"". When I was 14 I lost my virgenity to an asshole I thought I had it all untill some slut came around. When I was 15 I fell in love with an asshole again  He gave me a ring on my birth day. I did not know I was being treated by my boyfriend at the time. I was being treated like a dog. In my life I feel like I lose everything I have ever loved. Most of my family think I'm not ready for the world but I know I am. I'm sorry to my family for doing bad things  I'm sorry to my best friends for being for telling the truth. Some people don't like the truth most people don't Like me because I tell the truth.  Most people think I'm just like all the outher girls but as you can see I'm not. I'm just lost and crazy in this world. I feel like I don't belong in this world and know where to go. So I'm thanking my boyfriend for helping me trust again and I love him. I have two sisters ones name is Carolann I love her so much but she don't think that I am smart. She thinks I am going to fuck up my life just like she did. My sister Jill lives far away from me and she is lost and confused I have nothing nice to say about her. I have one brother named Garold but hes gay. Most peolp think that I am a slut but I know the truth thats all I need and if I was a slut you would know it.

"Friend slipping up at work. I talked to her and now she’s creating a bad environment for me. I’ll call my ex friend Mary.  We met at work.  I really valued our friendship because it’s hard for me to make friends.  I had a few hurt me in the past, so I became guarded.  Plus, I had to leave behind true ones when I moved away from my hometown 3 years ago.  About a year and a half ago, she started dating a new guy.  They seemed to have an ok relationship.  After a year of dating, they started having problems.  Mary spent every lunch hour complaining about him the entire time.  She stopped asking me how I was, always steering the conversation toward her bf.  I tried to be there for her, hugging her and reassuring her she’ll be ok.  She would be like, yeah I know but...then continue complaining about him.  She admitted to nagging him, and he eventually got sick of it and broke up with her.  She was a mess, crying at work, sometimes not even coming in.  I felt bad for her but it was the same thing over and over all the time, and I ran out of stuff to say.  Not to be offensive toward women (I am one, after all), but being the environment it is, word about Mary’s breakup traveled fast, and all our coworkers went up to Mary to comfort her. She leaned heavily on four of them, who often came up to her desk and asked if she wanted to talk.  Mary stopped hanging out with me and started spending a lot of time with them.  Mary would say yes when they offered to talk to her at work and they’d talk for like a half hour or longer (my desk is next to hers, so that’s how I knew).  I would also see Mary huddled in the hallways talking to these women a lot.  It affected Mary’s work.  She started taking on less work (claiming she was overwhelmed) and not being around (she would go off to find one of the women), so the rest of us would be left to answer her calls or speak to her clients on her behalf.  Our boss is very hands off and is a poor manager so he has no idea, and my coworkers just excuse Mary because they feel bad for her and don’t wanna tell our boss.  But because she and I handle certain cases that only she and I know how to deal with, it’s usually me who’s left to pick up the extra slack.  This went on for 3 months.  Honestly, if she wasn’t a friend, I might gone to our boss, but I decided to talk to Mary about it.  It didn’t go well. She got defensive, denied that she was slipping up, and accused me of being a bad friend cuz I wasn’t there for her during this difficult time.  I tried to point out examples of her slipping up and she denied it again.  I also told her she wasn’t there for me when my friend committed suicide or my dad had a health scare which left him disabled.  She just responded that she was left in so much despair from the breakup that she wasn’t capable of being unselfish enough to be a friend.  We both walked away mad.  She started ignoring me completely.  I didn’t think I was wrong but I still felt bad.  As this was around Christmas time, I decided to extend an olive branch by giving her a small Christmas gift and card that just said I was sorry and I hoped she had a merry Christmas.  The next day, she said thanks and we’d talk soon.  The day after that, she was back to ignoring me.  Now she doesn’t speak to me or even look at me, just pretends I’m not there.  I can’t say for sure, but I get the feeling that she told our coworkers about our conversation (I haven’t told anyone at work about it) cuz I now get the cold shoulder from some of them, too, when just the day before, we were all ok.  They, in front of me, make a show of hugging Mary and offer food to each other but not to me.  I even got a dirty look from one of the women, too.  Sigh, I don’t know what to do.

"Still recovering from ex-girlfriend To preface this, I’m sure anyone who reads this has seen something similar on this sub a million times already. This is long and the last three paragraphs are my main point, the rest is just an explanation of my previous relationship.  A little over a year ago my ex and I finally split after a long year and a half of on and offs filled with tons of emotional abuse. It was mainly her abusing me at first, getting angry for not texting her quickly enough, coming at my neck for hanging out with friends everynight ( I assume was because she stayed home all the time) and so on. The last couple times we dated she was always angry with me for cheating (which I never did) later to find out she was the one cheating on me. I was extremely depressed once we finally cut ties that I went back and talked to her and then she told me she cheated in detail so she could bring me down more.  After the breakup I ended up getting sick and after a couple months couldn’t even bring myself to take care of myself. Small stuff like wearing my retainer and showering before 5pm was the hardest part of my day. I know that seems small but it plays into how I feel now.  3 months after the breakup I started talking to a friend I met through my ex (however they were not and still aren’t friends anymore) and we’ve been happily together for almost a year now. There was a lot of useless drama with my ex about this which has been resolved but she still tries to harass me and my girlfriend. Last month she texted my phone from her friends number trying to harass me and it was just ridiculous.   Unfortunately I have to see her in May for my girlfriend’s prom, they are in the same senior class and I an currently a college sophomore. I still feel as though I am in a rough place and don’t physically look as good as I should. Stuff such as my teeth and acne and other results of that loss of hygeine that I still struggle with makes me feel like I have been doing worse than her, which I know shouldn’t matter but it still bothers me. I’ve tried getting my old habits back which work for a month and then I lose track again.  I guess my overall issue is I compare myself how I was when with her to where I am now, mostly with my appearance. I’m also still very depressed and feel that it puts me below her now. My only real win is that I’ve nearly kicked my drug addiction (mainly weed, I was using it to runaway from my problems) but now I can’t seem too kick my other habits of nicotine addiction and taking any kind of pill or cough syrup just to not be sober. I’ve distanced myself from friends and I simply feel lost and useless to the world. In college I can’t make new friends and just sit in my dorm room wishing I could go back and start over so I could be healthier than I am now.  I’m looking for advice or anyone to be straightforward with me on any aspect of my situation. Thank you to anyone who reads this and responds!

"The last few weeks I have slid back almost as far as before I started treatment. Just when I thought I was improving.  I finally went to the drop in center called Sunshine Place, as someone was giving a talk on depression. The counselor spoke with me for about half an hour after her talk and said she thought I needed more help than my GP was giving. For the first time in a few months I actually broke down and cried again - which is very annoying to me. She wrote down the number of the Mental Health Center with some suggestions for them. I rang the next day for an appointment (and that was hard just to ring). She had told me I might have to wait a few weeks for them to see me, but they made an appointment for the next day.  The psychiatirst there was okay (I didn't even cry like I normally do when talking to a new doc) but I told her I was tired of telling the same things to every new person. The short of it is they are changing me from Lexapro to Avanza and organizing for some CBT. I see my regular GP next Tuesday so I am pleased they said they would inform her of the medication change. I was also warned that I would probably feel a bit more depressed while the medication change was taking place; so I duly warned Mom and Matt not to take any notice of any strange behavior. Matt as usual just laughed and said ""yeah, Mom's going to go psycho"".  Now I just wait for them to contact me about the CBT.  If I don't answer any posts you'll know why, but I will try to just put a little emoticon up every now and then to let you know I am thinking of you all, and that I am still listening.

"I am  61 and for almost two years have been dealing with anxiety. It is strange the way of hitting and I would like to know from some of you experts if it is typical GAD.  For almost two years I have been awakened almost every day at about 5:30 out of sound sleep with this feeling of anxiety. At first it hit my spine, now my stomach. If I take a xanax it will dissipate and not bother me much until later in the day. Again, no matter what I am doing I can feel it start to build, take a xanax and go on with life. By late afternoon it is gone and doesn't return until the next day.  During this period my thyroid has been going haywire, probably from four surgeries in four years, the last being two months ago...a total knee repacement.. About sox weels before this surgery, after changing my thyroid meds a bit, the anxiety had left me. I was fine through the operation and then about three weeks after, it was back!  Before the operation I was beginning to get some real bouts of rolling depression but they are gone for now ... just anxiety. The thing that I question is that it is the same no matter what is or has happened in my life for the day. I can have a great, relaxed day or a hectic, chaotic day and the next day will be exactly the same. My environment doesn't seem to affect it. Is all of this typical of GAD or should I redress my thyroid or other hormonal screw ups? Thanks for reading. It's really getting me down!

"A friend of mine is being mean, or am I sensitive? A long time friend of mine (let’s call her Abby) has recently been a little cruel imo, but I’m not sure if it’s me. These three things happen in less than 2 days and now we’re not speaking. Also, we’re 14 and just started high school.  1: She laughed at my new haircut. I know that sounds frivolous, but Abby and this other girl were literally outright laughing. She claims she was just ‘being honest’.  2: She left me wandering. We had agreed to walk to an after school event together. She started walking without me and didn’t tell me, so I was walking around the high school, sending her a million messages trying to find her. I guessed she had left, but I didn’t want to ditch her if she hadn’t. I eventually just walked by myself. When I got there (late) it turned out she walked with two other girls (including the hair-laughing girl). When I called her out she said I was overreacting and that walking alone shouldn’t bother me (it didn’t, I was upset because she didn’t care about me) and that she wouldn’t care if the shoe was on the other foot. All I asked was that she apologize and next time *let me know* if she changed plans, which earned a sarcastic/sassy ‘we’ll sor-ry’.  3: Another friend of mine and Abby’s (it’s a trio friendship) asked to hang out (her name will be Robin). Abby didn’t come which I was kind of glad about, so it was just me and Robin. We walked around town and all. It wasn’t even very late (6:00) when this one group of guys (4 of them, 18ish) hollered at us from their car. At first we thought it was a prank, but it kept going. They did this multiple times, following us or looping back around to greet us. We were getting freaked out. So, when they loop back around again I’ve had enough. I yelled at them to F*** off.  I thought this was smart. I figured they’d either realize we weren’t having fun or something. Surprise, surprise, it made things worse. A lot worse.  Eventually, they got stuck at a light and we sprinted to a family members house nearby (who turned out had recently been hospitalized) and hid there until my Mom came.  Now, I know the F off move was incredibly dumb. I made it worse not only for myself but for my friend. Either way, the next day I was feeling guilty as hell and worried about Robin and what she thought of me and was just stressed in general. Not in a good mood.  I don’t even tell my friend what happened, she greets me with weird hints about last night. So I simply ask her to stop with these weird hints and actually talk to me. Basically, Robin told her about last night. So Abby being super nice says, to the best of my memory, “You realize your mistake, right? You understand that it was your fault. So just so you know, I have no sympathy at all.”  I know I was dumb, but hearing this after everything and what I already blamed myself for being told so bluntly and harshly at me by my friend set me off. I left and actually went and cried in the girls washroom that I know no one ever uses. I’m not sure what I expected, it was my fault, but she *greeted* me like this. No, “Hey, I heard you were followed...” or ANYTHING. Just straight up “it’s your fault I have no sympathy.” Like, Hey, nice to see you too.  Either way, we’re not talking anymore. I’ve tried to bring it up but it’s always, “I was just being honest... what did you expect? So you want me to lie? You’re being silly...” No acknowledgement. Also, this fight between me and Abby is affecting my friendship with Robin because it was a trio friendship. Also, Abby is my only friend at my school, I’m scared to be alone.  Sorry for how long this is, I think it’s sort of a rant too. What should I do? Am I completely out of line? How should I go about fixing this?  At the very least, how can I prevent this from affecting me and Robin?

"Okay, here's the deal. I'm 17, and I have been depressed and suicidal for as long as i can remember. (See the post ""God Hates Me"") I just want to die. I hate living. It feels like no one cares. In order to combat my depression I write. To date I have written four major writings (50,000- 200  pages -  words or more) and am on my fifth. Last year, when I was on my first major writing one of my friends asked me if she could read it. I was hesitant because it's my soul. I take everything I feel and put it down on the page. It's all I do. i don't go out or have any kind of social life. Writing is my life.  But, I eventually let her read it. She liked it and read that whole writing. Since then she has become my editor of sorts. There's just one problem - she's not editing.  You see, she's a drama geek - in plays and everything - and doesn't have a whole lot of free time so I understand a slow pace, but lately I've had to prod her to do anything. Even over Christmas break she didn't do anything. Now, I have to call her on the weekends (which is the only time she'll even do it now) to get her to do anything. If I don't she'll forget she even has it. Every time I ask her about it, she just tells me how busy she is and I end up feeling guilty. I feel like she's rejecting me as a person, like she's saying ""i just don't care about you."" It hurts me so bad. It makes me feel like the one thing keeping me alive is stupid. It makes me want to kill myself. I feel like it's a burden to her. It hurts me so bad. It makes me go home and cut myself. I have no idea how to handle the situation. I want her to do it, but I don't want it to seem like i'm pestering her. I understand she's busy, but she makes time to go out with her other friends. Couldn't she make a little time for me?  Am I being unreasonable here? What should I do? Please help.

" I haven't written any diaries or any other sort of it for a long time.. Not since my last relationship was over a year ago.. But the pain and hurt and unsecurity I feel right now are just too much for me.. It's been overloading and ready to explode.. I need to let it out somehow.. I just can't let it out to the person that actually needs to hear it most..  I don't understand why I'm always in this kind of relationship over and over again.. Why am I always with a man that has no future.. It's always ""no hope-no risk-no commitment"". I don't choose whom I fall in love with.. But it's always men like them..  The man I'm with now is the perfect example of my stupidity.. He's younger than me, we have nothing in common, he's too goodlooking, and not ready for a serious relationship.. I knew that from the very beginning. But somehow, I still let myself to fall in love with him. Why the hell would I do that? Doesn't my brain tell my heart what to do? Is there no connection at all between them?  I've trying to give this man everything.. I thought somehow I would melt his heart and make him fall in love with me.. Oh, I sound so pathetic now.. But now, after 9 months together.. Nothing has changed.. He's still and will never be the man I want him to be.. He make me feel so unsecure.. Especially when it comes to other women. I'm a jealous girl.. He knows that. And it doesn't stop him to get in touch with hix ex's, keep their pictures in his laptop, looking at other girls when he's with me, cooking for other girls and invite them to come over.. If he already has me, why would he do that, right? And what the hell am I doing with him until 9 months? I can't walk away from him.. I wish he copuld change someday.. Somehow.. I don't understand why he's doing this to me.. Does he realize how much he hurt me?  I don't know why I'm typing this.. I should be talking to him no and break up with him.. It would be so much easier if there's no love. I don't want to lose him but it's killing me everyday from all the pain he cause me..  The answer to my problem is so clear. Why can't I just take it?

" The city I work in, which feels and seems much more like a town, has a courthouse square downtown.  There is a big courthouse surrounded by a fair bit of grassy area with lots of trees, a beautiful little spot really.  It really adds to the whole town feeling.  All sorts of things happen in the town square: art festivals, performing art festivals, food & drink tasting, local merchant festival, and many more.    Well, one thing I've noticed since I started working downtown is that people (men mainly) like to take a mid-day nap in this courthouse square.  I lived outside of new Orleans before I moved here, so at first I thought these nappers were homeless people, untill I paid a little more attention to them.  The majority of these napping people are wearing clean, well kept clothes, and are clean-shaven.  In other words, they are just people who live/work around downtown who like a little afternoon nap.  They pick a tree, lay down, and just doze off for a little while.  I find that kind of interesting.

Backstory:  I never really saw eye to eye with him while growing up. He was quite the wild prankster, and his antics often left me humiliated and embarrassed. Back in my boyhood of 1991, he pantsed me while I performed at the school talent show. He routinely mentions this while at family gatherings, and it has subsequently caused me extreme grief. This trend of surprise humiliation lasted for two decades. Just when I thought me and gramps were cool again, I'd feel my pants hit the ground. He's  deprived me of my sanity, as well as given me an extreme fear of public speaking scenarios. I ended up forcing him to go to family counseling with me, and he denied the whole thing. After turning in historical footage (my mom always cam-corded my recitals or graduation ceremonies), he finally gave in and admitted to his rude behavior. It took a couple dozen sessions, ending with a mock-talent-show, where I played my trumpet for the therapist. Gramps just sat there, cool as ice. With arms folded, he nodded to me - and that's where things changed.  Anyhow, I had an extra ticket to go see Teagan and Sara - so I got ol' gramps on the phone. He kinda razzed me for listening to such feminine sounding music, but eventually accepted my invitation. I picked him up and brought him to the venue. The ticket office said there was a mixup, and that we'd get front-row seats. This was my lucky day, as well as a great way to finally bond with the old codger.   It took a couple of songs, but he really got into it. He was so exuberant, jumping up and down on his seat. He pulled me up, and I did the same. After the first half of the set wrapped up, the sisters on stage looked down at gramps and I. They asked us if we were having a good time, and also the nature of our relation. A stage hand passed down a microphone to gramps.   ""I'm here with my grandson!""  There was this big 'awwww' that came from the crowd. They asked us how long he'd been a fan, and he mentioned the fact that I would sometimes play their songs on my trumpet. To my amazement, they pulled me and gramps on stage for the next song. They got me a trumpet and instructed me to play a solo to ""I was a fool"" - It was literally one of the best moments of my life. I was on stage with my favorite sister duet band.  Right as I put the brass mouthpiece to my lips, I felt those wrinkly little fingers jutting into my belt loops. I tried to stop him, but my pants hit the ground before I could react. I wanted to die in that moment. Security ended up escorting us out of the venue, where a police officer was waiting for us.  Now we're both cell mates for the next year. We got caught in some type of legal double-whammy. He, being the pantser, was ruled guilty for sexual assault. Me, the pants-ee, was convicted of exposure and indecency. Both of us will have to register as sex offenders once we're out of the clink.   Anyhow - I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how we could pass the time together? Any board games or things like that? We have a whole year of time to kill, and it really took being cellmates for me to understand exactly how generation gapped we are. Anyhow, your advice is greatly appreciated. I gotta hide this phone, but I'll check for your replies later tonight.

" Hello!  This is my first post on blogspot and the first day of school. My language arts teacher told us about blogspot and how we all might make one. So I decided to go ahead and get use to it.  I never liked the first day of school because everything is messed up. I didn't even know what bus I was suppose to get on. This morning they told me something completly different than what I was told this afternoon. Most of my teachers are nice, which is a good thing of course.  I finally met my neighbor today! She's a junior and I've already met her brothers. They're all really nice. But now I dont have to ride the bus alone, so, it's all good!  I can't wait until FCA (fellowship of christian athletes) starts again. It's always an amazing experience and it's awesome because you're worshipping in school!  I will try to remember to post on this everyday. I will post some artwork once i find out how.

" Fourth of July: It was kinda boring for me. A few of Rachel's friends came over and we shot off some big fireworks that my daddy bought. It was alright I guess. Wow, okay now onto these last 2 days. I had to wake up at 5:30 in the morning on Monday to get ready to go to my Grandparents' house(which is in Branson--4 hours away). On the way we got McDonald's breakfast(because that's the only meal they can make that is good enough to choke down.) We got to their house at around noon. We came in and talked for a little bit, then we watched the tape of my promotion and from dance camp. Then we sat. And talked. And sat. And ate. And sat. Then my dad and grandpa went outside to unload firewood and they forced me to help them. Okay, I'm not the type of girl that goes out in the woods and loads firewood into a 30 year old Ford truck, but I did it just because I'd rather do that than sit inside and talk to my grandma, lol. When we were unloading it onto the stack of firewood that was already there, I got bit by an ant. It hurt like hell, so I went inside to put aloe vera on it. I checked my phone and saw that Kierston had called me, so I called her back. We ended up talking for the next half hour until my family came back inside and then we ate spaghetti for lunch. After lunch, Rachel and me went outside and rode the four-wheeler for a little while. Then I came back inside and called Cam and we talked until he had to go to baseball. We ate mac and cheese for dinner and then we watched TV for a little bit. Then I called Kier again cause I was bored and we talked for a little while. Then I came inside again and got ready for bed. I figured I should go to bed early since old people wake up early. The next day, my dad came in and woke me up at 9. I was soo mad. So I got up and ate breakfast, then went back to sleep till about noon or 1. My phone was dead, so I couldn't call anyone, unfortunately. We talked again for like an hour or whatever and then we left. On the way home we stopped by IHOP and I got some chocolate chip pancakes. And we got home late last night and I got on AOL, watched TV, the usual. Went to bed at like 3, woke up today at 12. Today Colton came over to see Rachel. They went swimming and she's taking him home right now. I'm sitting here bored out of my mind typing the longest thing I think I've ever typed in my life. Later...

"Bed time and the tears... Every night it is the same song and dance.  We have dinner, clean up, bath, games/tv, bed.  I say okay guys, wrap it up and go pee and get a sip of water it is bed time and the moans and groans begin.  It continually gets worse as we go up the stairs and get to the room. I have a 4, 7, and 8 year old and they like to sleep in the same room, it is a bunk bed.  My 7 year old is crying because she says she never gets to make choices and she can’t wait to be grown up and she isn’t tired, etc, etc.....  My youngest becomes kind of rowdy and doesn’t know where she is going to sleep or who she will sleep with.  My oldest is the best, he is actually ready for bed and just laying, waiting for the show to end.  I have a steady bed time each night, around 9:15.   I am open to suggestions and new ideas. I am at my wits end with the night routine. It actually makes me really sad because no matter how much I do it is never enough for my children. I truly do want them to be happy. I give them several warnings before it is bed time to make sure they are doing what they want before the nights end.

"I’m working on a new app/startup to help you guys. Please read this, I would really appreciate any help/feedback. Hello everyone! I’m a current sophomore in college studying Computer Science and this summer I decided to work on a new app that caters to depressed/suicidal people who are going through bad times. I want this app to connect depressed users to people who are volunteers at crisis centers or just regular people in general that are willing to devote their time to helping the users. This app will be similar to twitch where the volunteer will go live (and you can see their face) and any user can instantly connect with them. First, the user will enter their information like: what their favorite tv shows/movies/music artists are, where they’re from, and what type of gender they’d feel most comfortable talking to. All this information gathered will be used to connect the user with a volunteer that closely fits those preferences (the user can swipe through all of the options that are given to them and they can actually add these volunteers to a list that they’d like to come back to). I want it to be a one on one session where the user can decide to turn his/her camera on, or if not, just use the microphone, or if they don’t want to do either of those options, they can just use the chat box provided. I want it to be a social platform where users can connect with other users and see what they’re doing. Basically a user is becoming friends with their “streamers”/“volunteers” and other users as well. Also, these one-on-one sessions can be changed to a room where there can be 4 users to one volunteer and that way more people can connect with each other with like a “chaperone”. I wouldn’t dare dream of making any money from this app and I know I need funding from VC’s to get this thing skyrocketing. That is why I am getting all the resources I need from my school’s entrepreneurial program and they are going to connect me to the people I need to know. I hate to say it but if I need to make shareholders money, then I’ll do it, but I don’t want to make a single dime off of an idea that caters to people who are struggling through something so drastic. This may sound far fetched but my biggest dream for this app/company, is to have a box filled with goodies being mailed to users when the holidays/Valentine’s Day/ birthdays come around that include: letters/voice messages from volunteers saying “Happy Birthday!” Or “Merry Christmas!” Or “Happy Valentine’s Day!” followed by more messages that has to do with the user. This box will also include a lot more goodies that has to specifically do with the user.   I used to be like you guys. I can’t say that I suffered as much as you guys but I came to this sub a couple of times when I had no one else to go to. I had no shoulder to cry on in my freshman year of college which is why I think this app could actually mean something to someone. Please, we need to try and put an end to the huge suicide rate among children/adults in America. Please provide any feedback, whether good, bad, or helpful. Anything helps, really. I can also answer any questions you might have about this app. Please excuse my bad grammar, I’m a computer science major for a reason haha.

"Hi everyone, I'm new, and feeling kind of lost and shy. To introduce myself a little, I'm a 28 year old female. Up until about a year ago, I'd never had any problem with depression or any other mental illness, though all of the other women in my family have depressive tendencies. Suddenly, I started to feel differently in my mind - a feeling which has gone on getting worse and worse. The last four months in particular have been a downward spiral. I moved house from a big city to a small village late last year, and I'm not dealing with the change well. I don't know anyone in my local area, and I don't drive so I'm stuck in this little isolated world (I work from home). I lack the energy and the confidence to go out and meet new people. I tend to organize/run everything in our household so basic routines have just fallen apart, and my long-term relationship is under strain. My partner doesn't understand how I feel, while I resent the fact that he's making no effort to recognize the problem and take some action to help. My family and friends are 300 miles away, and I don't feel able to talk to them. This last week, I found out my Mum is having tests run for breast cancer. I know it's early days but it's just the last little thing that has pushed me over the edge. I am walking around either in a state of complete, grey numbness or in a state of unutterable misery, unable to react to anything in a rational way. I haven't left the house for days, because I hate the village where I live and being there just sends me into a blind panic attack. I've had an initial assessment for counseling in a city near where I live, but it'll be weeks before I can get an appointment. I know that I need to go and see a GP and get some medication, but I don't have the energy even to pick up the phone and talk to the receptionist, let alone to walk on my own through the horrible village. And I'm just so exhausted all the time. The internet's my only point of contact with the outside world at the moment. If all this sounds familiar to anyone, please reply - it would be a lifeline for me. Thanks Wizzy.",1,hi everyone new feeling kind lost shy introduce little year old female year ago problem depression mental illness woman family depressive tendency suddenly started feel differently mind feeling gone getting worse worse month particular downward spiral moved house big city small village late year not dealing change well not know local area not drive stuck little isolated world i work home lack energy confidence meet new people tend organizerun household basic routine just fallen apart longterm relationship strain partner doe not understand feel resent fact making effort recognize problem action help family friend mile away not feel able talk them week mum having test run breast cancer know early day just little thing pushed edge walking state complete grey numbness state unutterable misery unable react rational way not left house day hate village live just sends blind panic attack initial assessment counseling city near live week appointment know need gp medication not energy pick phone talk receptionist let walk horrible village just exhausted time internet point contact outside world moment sound familiar anyone reply lifeline me thanks wizzy

" Again, Not a lot happened to me today. It started off regularly, showered,got dressed, ate and so forth. Then I decided to play MSN before I went to school. I saw that Kendra was on so we talked about the hot gossip in town... it was mainly about the Jarret and Sarah and their new found love. I got to school abit on the late side, but I just had Bio so I didn't give a damn. Then we skip ahead to 3:15, because school is gay and I don't want to talk about it. I really felt like doing something after school just because I didn't want to go home. But everyone was preoccupied so I had no other choice but to go home. I then decided I would go for a drive to kill some time. So I'm driving down main when I see a group of hutterites trying to cross the street. They were already almost half way across when I started slowing down. When they saw me, it was as if I was the Anti-Christ. All 4 of them just start scrambling around. They looked like fucking retards out there. So 2 head back for safety and infront of the Co-op and the other 2 bravely take the risk and proceed to the other side. I was so close to rolling down my window and start yelling at the the retards...Fuckers   That was the most exciting thing that happened to me today.   Then I went over to the school to see what Big K was up to. He was doing some stupid accounting shit with Connie. He asked me to go get his pictures from the Parasave for him. So I did that, then I went over to Radio Shack to see what was new there. Mitch was there but he was TOO BUSY TO TAlk...So I once again left. After about other 5 minutes of driving I got bored and went home. The rest of my night was then followed by, eating, MSN, then homework.   That pretty much sums it all up.

"My grandma is dying and life doesn't stop So I work full-time and go to grad school part-time. I'm busy 7 days a week between work, class, and homework/housework. Normally this is a very good thing for me as it keeps the depression and other mental illness at bay.  But my grandma's dying. She was put into hospice over the weekend and can't do much of anything anymore. I love her so much as my grandparents/mom's side of the family have been the only stable family I've ever had. My grandmother is an amazing woman. She graduated as valedictorian of her college class.

"I want to share a personal project I'm proud of A month ago I was feeling completely unmotivated to do anything. I was feeling that none of my connections with friends are as deep as they used to be, that I'm not as close to my family as I used to be, that nothing I do at work really matters, and that my health is slowly deteriorating. I just wanted to quit at everything.  Then I was hanging out with a friend I hadn't seen in a while, and he admitted to me that he had been struggling with depression, so we both opened up about it. He ended up recommending the book ""Feeling Good"" to me, since it had helped him improve a lot. I read it and was initially a bit disappointed... some parts were underwhelming, some felt annoying/condescending, and the solution to every problem seemed to be the ""three-column technique."" But after trying a few of the exercises in the book, I admit it turned out to be somewhat helpful.  One of the exercises/quizzes in the book is the ""Depression Checklist,"" which (as I'm sure many of you are aware of) assesses your level of depression on a scale from 1 to 100. At the time, I was scoring in the ""Moderate"" range. After a couple weeks of applying some of the exercises, I was down to the ""Mild"" range. So I decided to create a project that might help me learn a bit more about myself, with regard to the effect of my daily habits on my level of depression.  What I wanted to build was a simple web app that would let me score my productivity on a daily basis (based on exercising, reading, socializing, meditating, etc) and then plot that against my daily depression score. I wanted to see if there was a correlation between higher productivity and lower depression, or if certain activities had a greater impact on my mood.  Ironically what I discovered was that working on the project itself was a huge mood-booster for me, since it gave me a sense of purpose and was a great outlet for creativity. As I've gotten further along in the work, I've noticed my depression level has slowly started rising again. But for a while, I was actually in the ""Normal"" range of depressive emotions! I couldn't believe it.  Regardless, the project has also given me more insight into a few things that drastically help my mood. Even though my mood isn't at the level it was a couple weeks ago, it's nice to know that investing in personal projects gives me a lot of satisfaction :)  (Also if anyone is interested in trying out the app, feel free to check it out [here](https://beok.herokuapp.com/). It's stupid simple and still a work in progress, but I'm still kinda proud of it... and if it were able to help even just one other person, that would make me pretty happy &lt;3)",1,want share personal project proud month ago feeling completely unmotivated anything feeling connection friend deep used be not close family used be work really matter health slowly deteriorating just wanted quit everything hanging friend not seen while admitted struggling depression opened it ended recommending book feeling good me helped improve lot read initially bit disappointed part underwhelming felt annoyingcondescending solution problem threecolumn technique trying exercise book admit turned somewhat helpful exercisesquizzes book depression checklist a sure aware of ass level depression scale time scoring moderate range couple week applying exercise mild range decided create project help learn bit myself regard effect daily habit level depression wanted build simple web app let score productivity daily basis based exercising reading socializing meditating etc plot daily depression score wanted correlation higher productivity lower depression certain activity greater impact mood ironically discovered working project huge moodbooster me gave sense purpose great outlet creativity gotten work noticed depression level slowly started rising again while actually normal range depressive emotion not believe it regardless project given insight thing drastically help mood mood not level couple week ago nice know investing personal project give lot satisfaction also interested trying app feel free check here stupid simple work progress kinda proud it able help just person make pretty happy lt
" Oy vey, its about three in the A.M. and I just got back from a midnight showing of Farenheit 9/11.   urlLink Wow.   There were reports of people actually being so appalled at this film to go as far as slashing the screen in anger.  And it's easy to see why, to put it bluntly, I love Michael Moore.  In short, it's about the bush adminidstration and such follies and gags.  Mr. Moore goes into the very bowels of the bush admniistration(too big of a word for this late at night) and brings up all the dirty secrets that they have been hiding in the past four years.  It goes from the election, to the patriot act all the way through the war in Iraq.  Not only that, but he got to poke fun at bush the entire time.  Its good wholesome family fun.  Actually I shouldn't say that, there are in fact a lot of very graphic scenes that were incredibly hard to watch.  A lot of things that made me incredibly angry that this could ever happen.  Even though some of these things were very difficult for me to watch, it is necessary to know about such things so that we can know what is going on in our nation.  There are also  urlLink a few points  that I wanted to be put in that weren't.  This movie also made me incredibly frustrated that I, still being a minor, cannot vote on this topic.  The movie is two hours and three minutes long, is rated R and should be angering republicans in a theatre near you.

"I tried to get onto the chat room, but it won't let me so I'll just post my question here. In my sociology class today my professor was talking about an experiment where several pseudomanic (healthy) patients checked into mental hospitals to record the results. The details of the experiment aren't important, but what I was wondering was about how my teacher said that the patients used fake names so that it would not be on their permanent record and so that they wouldn't be labeled as ""crazy"". So I raised my hand and asked who would be labeling them and why they couldn't use their real names, like how would people know? He said that it would be on their record and that if people wanted to find out if they have ever been hospitalized they could, particularly employers. Kind of like if you wanted to inquire about a rapist living in your town, is what he said. I wanted to ask more but didn't want to press it. So my questions are, what kind of record does this go on? Your hospital record? Your police record? When employers do a background check, does this show up? Then I was wondering, when police pull you over for speeding or something and they check your information on their computer, what comes up? Everything? If they were involved in an ambulance taking someone into the hospital, do they have that on file? Is there any way to see what's on your file? I'm just a little paranoid now about if there are going to be limitations in life now as to what I can do because of my record.  Or if anyone knows how I would be able to find out this information that would be great, ",1,tried chat room not let just post question here sociology class today professor talking experiment pseudomanic healthy patient checked mental hospital record result detail experiment not important wondering teacher said patient used fake name not permanent record not labeled crazy raised hand asked labeling not use real name like people know said record people wanted hospitalized could particularly employer kind like wanted inquire rapist living town said wanted ask did not want press it question are kind record doe on hospital record police record employer background check doe up wondering police pull speeding check information computer come up everything involved ambulance taking hospital file way file just little paranoid going limitation life record know able information great
"Me too. You want a friend. You want someone to be there with you when you’re weak, and someone to comfort you when you’re down. You wish you weren’t alone but you feel invisible. You’re trapped in your thoughts and nobody can reach you. You feel like you can’t do anything right, like you’re useless. Everybody has friends except for you. You’re a burden and nobody actually likes you, you just exist. You push people away because you feel like you don’t have anything to offer, so you’d rather just be left alone. You can’t wait to die because life is pointless. You don’t want to get up anymore because you’ve been knocked down too many times. You’re so tired and weak, and the weight is crushing you even more.

" I love that word. Ponderings. If you break it up you get pond, like lake, eh, like oh, ring like disaster. Because wedding rings do tend to end up in disaster. So pondering is like dipping into a lake of disaster. Mmmm. Maybe if I shut my eyes I'll be able to feel the waves washing over me, hear the delicate ripples as leaves fall into my pond and breathe in the air of immortality. If the Philosophers Stone is a soluble tablet, my lake of disaster is the solution for it. Like in chemistry. I dreamt the other night that I was in a cold, dark lake and that I was below, watching the world through a rippled mirror. I saw myself peering down and a white hand slooshing the water and slooshing my view. When it was finally clear again, all there was was a star that lit up the lake. And in the middle of the star, there was me, spread out in a crucifix shape with my eyes blazing and my hair fanning out like it does underwater. I reached out to feel the wetness on my hair, but I felt only heat as the star plunged into the icy water and I melted into oblivion. I love random dreams.

"I have my ECT consultation today and I’ve never felt more alone. I have a good support system around me but somehow I’ve never felt more alone than at this moment. Nobody else that I know has had depression as severe as mine, or has ever been in this position where the choices are: be miserable forever, or zap your brain which might seemingly cause permanent memory damage and may not even work after all that.  Last night was the first time I’ve felt really suicidal in a while (mostly I’ve just been miserable and haven’t even been motivated to plan my suicide). Why go through all these awful, invasive treatments when I could just end it quickly and quietly and then everyone else could get back to their lives? I feel like an immense burden.   I’ve been severely depressed for the better part of 2 years at this point. It has totally disabled me, robbed me of a career I loved, and made most things difficult or unbearable. I’ve tried 7 different drugs to try and get it and my anxiety under control. No cigar.   I don’t necessarily want to die, I just don’t want to live, if that makes sense. I feel as if my husband, friends, and doctor are keeping me artificially alive with all these treatments that don’t work, when in reality, I’m that painfully sick dog that needs to just be put down already.   I never thought the potential for another treatment would actually make me more suicidal, but here we are.

"How I Learned About My Birthfather... &amp; My Brother? I remember when I was around 11, my little cousin, Lily, who was 6, came from Cuba to the U.S. with her parents. They stayed in our home for a few months until they were able to find a place.   Right before they left for their new home; I was on my computer, I was 12, playing educational computer games. My family is chattering/gossiping in the living room per usual. I never had any interest in the family gossip, I just wanted to be in my own little space/world. Lily was not like that at all, she loved to listen-in on family drama. It was not long until Lily came barging into the room saying:     ""I know a secret.""     ""What?""     ""Roberto isn't your real dad.""     ""Liar.""     ""I'm not lying, they're talking about it!""     ""I don't believe you, so just leave me alone.""     ""Just ask your mom.""  After that she left the room and the seed of doubt was planted in my head. I did not think twice of it at that moment. It sure as hell bothered the hell out of me for days.. then weeks.. and eventually to months, to almost a year.  It wasn't long after, I started to doubt it myself. I did not really look like my father, Roberto. He was light-medium brown skin color, I had pale skin with freckles. My mother had a light tan. Things that I did not notice before started to bother me. The difference in skin color, I did not have his last name, there were not baby pictures of him holding me. I did not feel a connection to this man. I was 13, almost 14, when I decided to confront my mom about it while she was organizing important documents. There was something about this that was bugged me was that... I KNEW the answer to her question BEFORE she could respond. I was 99.9% sure already, but I still had that 0.1% in order to fully believe it.     ""Mom, can I ask you something?""     ""What?""     ""Is Roberto my real dad?""     ""No.""     ""Who is?""     ""I can't talk right now, I'm busy.""      It was at that moment that I knew she did not really care to talk about it. Of course, I would bring it up again and she would brush it off just the same. ""I'm busy,"" or ""Not right now."" After a while, I stopped communicating with my mother and our relationship has suffered, to this day, because of it. It was not long after my mother asked for a divorce to my step-father. I remember her sitting me down on the couch and talking to me through it. I did not have a strong relationship with Roberto to begin with, it hurt to an extent, but it was not something that I felt devastated over. She did end up telling me that she married Roberto to provide me a father figure.    On my 14th birthday, Roberto tells my mother and aunt that we need to leave the house permanently. The day after my birthday, we packed up our things the same day and left. All of this happened one week before school started, I was going to start high school. It was hard for the first few months, and around that time I started to get more curious about my birthfather as Roberto was separating himself from the picture. So I began to research him, ask my mother (always backfires on me), and listening to family gossip. One of the few things I caught was that my mother came into the U.S. legally, unknowingly pregnant. When she began to go see the doctors for a check-up, that is when she found out she was pregnant. Got married to my step-father, Roberto, when I was 2yrs, and from there I believed he was my father all along up until I asked her.  On April 20th, 2017 I received a random friend request on Facebook. The last name was exactly like my last name and strangely enough, looking at this guy's profile picture, he looked a lot like me -- strange. It took me a few days of speculation to finally grow the balls to accept the friend request after 6 days, April 25th.     ""May I ask who you are? And do you have any relationship to Alexander?""     ""I am his son. From what I see, you're my sister.""     From there he asked for my phone number. I was still skeptical and asked for details such as my birthfather's birthday and my mother's name to prove it. Once it was proven, I gave him me information. I found out I had a little brother in Cuba, he turned just 19 this year in January. My birthfather and his family were in Cuba. My brother 3½ yrs younger than me. It is absolutely crazy thinking how I was raised as an only child, while he was raised knowing I existed somewhere in the world. I still have trouble wrapping my head around this.  I video chatted with my birthfather, Alexander, and brother, Lazaro, for hours. My father was crying. I did not get the full details on HOW they found me, it was hard to understand -- the Internet connection was extremely bad and it costs a lot of money to communicate from Cuba to the United States. I saw my grandparents for the first time. My grandfather was crying on the webcam and my grandmother was crying as well. They looked so happy and kept telling me that they prayed to God every day to just see me and that I was happy/healthy. We all laughed, we cried, we smiled. It was bittersweet. We asking questions and answering them through smiles, tears, and laughter.   Unfortunately, a lot of time has passed, and that would be the first and only time I would have seen my grandmother. She died unexpectedly on December 24th, 2017. (R.I.P. Abuela Ramona)   Hopefully, I can make a trip out to Cuba this year so that I can meet my family. My mother will not be joining me on my trip as she does not want to be part of that. I am not mad at my mother, I am just disappointed in the way she kept such a secret from me. I do not trust her on the same level as I did prior to all of it. My hands are shaking as I write all of this down. I am still trying to wrap my head around it. It is 2018 now and I will be planning a trip this summer to see them hopefully. The realization is hitting me that I am anxious beyond belief. I felt as though I babbled a little too much, but I needed to get this all out. This was therapeutic for me. I am going to sleep now, good night ladies and gentlemen. Sleep well.  I will be making a new post about meeting them.

" I just finished reading G.K. Chesterton's ""The man who was Thursday"" on sunday.  I think it is possibly among the more thought stirring books I have ever read, especially the following lines ""When I saw him from the back, I was convinced he was a devil.  But when I saw his face, I knew he was a God.""  It was one of the more powerful lines of the novel, and I won't tell you much more because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet.  I think the most amazing books I have ever read (outside of the Bible) have been mainly fiction ones, that touched my heart rather than the philosophical ones that expanded my mind.  It is quite surprising that these novels are so dear to me considering my own overly cerebral nature.  Ravenheart by David Gemmel, has probably done more for me than Ethics, by Aristotle.

"I guess I am writing because I don't know how to think or feel at this period. I feel that I have hurt a lot of people by having my depression, especially my parents. I haven't phoned them in 2 weeks, I just don't have the courage to talk to them. I guess they feel that I blame them for my condition. Same with my remaining 2 sisters. Dang what a situation I have put myself in!  I still have a group of friends that like me a lot, but I haven't told them about suffering from depression. I hide it inside and either act in anxious way or I do solitary activities such as write poems, play the piano or swim.  I guess the main embuggerance is that I finding the third year of my course a real struggle at the best of times, but having understanding tutors and talking to doctors that have depression help.  I don't know why things have turned out the way things are, why I struggle with anything remotely challenging, but I guess that will never be explained. Sometimes i feel frustrated with the way things have turned and I can do very little to change the current of of my present situation.  I feel kind of sick with stuff at the moment. Not that I am assuming a victim complex, but just that in all the poems I write about, I always seek a sanctuary from the business aspect of life, you know the dog eat dog, go compete with others to get a job and survive for the next 55 years of my projected lifespan. Yeah pretty heady thoughts I'm having!  I guess I'm just scared of the future. I don't know how to survive, I kind of want to blank the future out. I guess all in all, I want to live a simple life and be decent to others. I would like the people I meet in the future to say hey that Haymond guy was a splendid fellow who really loved people and would go out of his way to help them, because he could.   But than an inner anxiety knows that I have hurt people from withdrawing into myself and by depression's virtue being too self indulgent. That hurts the most, knowing I hurt people from my depression. I never intended to harm anyone or be this way. If I could smile and be happy I would, but I can only show the scars of my mental pain as a testament to self torment.  Don't get me wrong, I smile sometimes and even rejoice in the company of those friends in normal health, but I guess I feel rejected. Self rejection and by that of the stigma of the people of the same age I encounter on campus and at home.  I want this to stop I guess. I want a placebo pill that will transport me to the Elysium fields, because sometimes reality is a bugger to experience. I guess the main message is that I want respite from this life, some form of relief and rest, where I will achieve or obtain this elusive elixir of peace. But I'm here, still standing, still finding a lot of life a challenge, still merging into a crowd of people who are too proud to admit that sometimes things may be too much.  Who am I and what am I doing here ... I haven't a faintest clue. Yeah, I'm scared of defeat, of a battered ego that even a shred of self esteem that I had will be allowed to fly in the fresh wind.  Its sounds like I'm asking for love ... I guess I am. Also that I would love some help, and in no small measure I have requested that help from doctors and therapists and talked to you my dear friends. But I find it extremely hard to help myself, to make amends with the very mind that hurts me so.  I don't know what to think is what I wrote at the top of the blog, now seems apt to include it in the conclusion. I guess spilling my emotions has made me feel somewhat dizzy!

"I’ve lost the last of my hope for “my turn”. I (24M) think that without making the conscious decision to, I’ve given up. I think I’ve just reached the point where I’ve stopped kidding myself that it’ll all “get better” or “work out someday” like people always tell you. What I can’t seem to shake is the faint screaming in the back of my head trying to get me to fix everything, the one who still believes happiness is possible despite my entire existence thus far indicating otherwise.  I work at a job in an office doing pointless work that I used to swear to myself in high school and college that I’d never wind up doing. 5 days a week I wake up at 7, leave at 7:30, work from 8-5, and get home (at my parents’ house) at 5:30. Then I eat dinner with them, watch TV with them, and they go to bed, so I turn in at 9, watch more TV, and go to bed myself. On the weekends I typically do nothing. When I do go out or hang out with a friend, we do nothing, just sit and watch TV or a movie. Unless we can find some fictional world we can discuss (Marvel, GoT, Star Wars, etc) we don’t even have much to talk about. I maybe have 2-3 friends that I do this with, and again, not too often.  I do not currently have, nor have I ever had, anything even resembling a love life. I was foolishly in love with a close friend who felt nothing for me thru high school and most of college before I managed to stop kidding myself on that one. I’ve never had sex with or even kissed a girl. The closest thing I ever did was cuddle with a really close friend, and I even fucked that up because I overthought everything as always and didn’t make a real move, and she instantly lost interest/gave up on me, and now we’re barely even friends anymore.  I’m an introvert with no desire to change. I have no interest in going out to bars, clubs, or anything people my age for some reason enjoy. All I want is a person to love and spend my time with and provide each other with the human contact we need. My idea of the perfect evening would be cuddling on the couch with a girl I love and watching Netflix, just enjoying the closeness, maybe some kissing. Sex is something I want but not even on my radar right now.   My life goals can be summed up in saying I want to find my “person” have a kid or two, and do what I can to make them and myself happy. I just honestly don’t see the path to that reality, though. Nothing matters to me anymore. Just my parents, and I can honestly say that I am 100% safe as long as they’re around because I care more about them than myself. However, if they were gone tomorrow, I think I’d be close behind.   I just don’t see a path out of this pointless existence that I feel capable of taking. I feel like I’m just serving a sentence, going through the motions until it’s mercifully done.  No question really. I just felt the need to say it and acknowledge that I’m done. With everything.  TL;DR: I’m done, burnt out. Life’s never been good to me and I’ve stopped expecting “my turn”. I see no way to achieve the few things in life I want.",1,lost hope turn m think making conscious decision to given up think just reached point stopped kidding better work someday like people tell you shake faint screaming head trying fix everything belief happiness possible despite entire existence far indicating otherwise work job office doing pointless work used swear high school college wind doing day week wake leave work home at parent house eat dinner them watch tv them bed turn watch tv bed myself weekend typically nothing hang friend nothing just sit watch tv movie unless fictional world discus marvel got star war etc not talk about maybe friend with again not often not currently have had resembling love life foolishly love close friend felt high school college managed stop kidding one sex kissed girl closest thing did cuddle really close friend fucked overthought did not make real move instantly lost interestgave me barely friend anymore introvert desire change going bar club people age reason enjoy want person love spend time provide human contact need idea perfect evening cuddling couch girl love watching netflix just enjoying closeness maybe kissing sex want not radar right now life goal summed saying want person kid two make happy just honestly not path reality though matter anymore just parent honestly say safe long care myself however gone tomorrow think close behind just not path pointless existence feel capable taking feel like just serving sentence going motion mercifully done question really just felt need say acknowledge done everything tlr done burnt out life good stopped expecting turn way achieve thing life want

"Friend problems So my school is a small school so in my class there’s only 10-12 people. I currently have a friends let’s call them Monica and natalie. I hang out with them but, I’m always the  second one. By second one, I mean like a second choice. When one of them isn’t at school or aren’t with them, they’ll come to me. It’s a problem when I have to get a pair for class activities like in PE. I had a friend who I thought she could be my real friend. I’ll call her hailey. I one told her a secret and she spoiled it to the whole school. I still gave her a chance. She started being really harsh on me and what I like which is photography. She would always insult me and say negative things that makes me think negative. I realized that we didn’t really go well and that our interests are very different. So We kinda stopped hanging out often. I tried my best to be funny and social. My friendship between my friends (Natalie and Monica)  were getting better but I was still the one that they didn’t really care. Now hailey is trying so hard to be friends with Monica, Natalie and maybe me. Natalie knows that she’s trying to “be like us” but Monica doesn’t. Monica is slowly hanging out with hailey. Hailey started to ask me what I like to wear and all the small stuff. And she also wouldn’t stop talking about my crush and his best friend. Which is uncomfortable for me. her personality changed and I realized she is actually trying to be like my friends.

" I've never been good at keeping a diary, so this may not work out so well.  Today after work, I had a surprise in that Jeff had called and left me a message on my cell phone.  I was very skeptical of ever hearing from him again.  I still do not know what happened over graduation weekend to cause the complete lack of communication between us recently.  I guess at some level I knew that we would never be able to work things out with 800 miles between us.  I was dreaming for a little bit.  I do believe things happen for a reason, however.  I just wish I could figure out the reason for having met James at this time in my life.  It's almost scary how perfect he is for me.  We have the same stupid sense of humor and understand each other perfectly.  I can't imagine him ever being an asshole or us ever staying mad at each other.  Why does he have to move to Texas in 6 weeks?  Long distance just isn't my thing.  So once again, I will get my heart broken and recover only to move on and get it broken again.  Which I guess is the way I prefer it.  I'm too young to settle down with one man.  I just wish I would quit meeting these incredible guys at such wrong times.   When am I going to get a break in love?    On the good side, I had a fabulous weekend.  I am beginning to love my new home here.  The possibilities are endless in this area.  I am making friends and figuring my way around.  Work is good...much better than I had thought it could be.  I guess I am a true geek at heart...who would have known?  I still don't think I could live here for the rest of my life though and be happy.  I think this is a great stepping stone though for 4 or 5 years.  Then it will be off to bigger and better things for me.  Maybe I'll move back home.  Or maybe to Texas... :)  who knows.  I love that I have so many choices in my life.

"Where to start.... Well, I guess I'm here because I think I have depression. I did recently talk to a therapist about it a couple of weeks ago. I guess it did some good because I feel like I may have gotten to the root of my problems. She told me that I was depressed and that I have probably had a low grade depression for most of my life. I kind of thought that I was depressed, because when I would read an article about depression with 10 yes or no questions I would usually answer yes to nine of them. The original reason my wife and I went to a counselor in the first place was because my wife was mad about my occasional habit of looking at pornography on the internet. I understand this bothers her and I do not want to do anything that will upset her. I could never give her an acceptable reason why I did it. I really do not know why myself. I do not think that I have an addiction to sex. It does not dominate my thoughts or life by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I think that I am pretty ""tame"" compared to most males. Anyway, this causes a lot of strife in my marriage because my wife considers this cheating on her. Well, back to depression. We got to talking about this in counseling and the counselor asked me if I'd ever been molested before. Oh boy. Well, this has always been the big secret part of my life. When I was 6 or 7 years, a female cousin of mine, who was about 4 years older, played some ""touching"" games with me over the course of 2 summers. It was all just touching, but I knew it was wrong. She would tell me that I could never tell anyone because I would get in trouble. So I didn't, until that therapy session. No, I had never told my wife because I always felt embarrassed and like I was to blame because I did not do anything to stop my cousin. I pretty much told the therapist (and my wife of course), everything that had happened to me. I got REALLY upset and probably cried more than anytime in my adult life. I felt somewhat better after talking, but inside I still feel ashamed and responsible for it. The counselor said that because of those incidences, I have had a low grade depression all these years because of holding it all in. I have ALWAYS had a hard time expressing my feelings about anything to anyone. That's just me. I told the therapist that I could see the low grade depression in my day to day life, but there are times when I feel like there is a huge, massive black cloud on me. I can be doing just about anything when suddenly I have this overwhelming feeling of dread and emptiness. There are times that I feel like if I could wish for my own death at that instant, I would gladly do it. When I don't have those bad lows, I just feel numb. The therapist said I might want to try medication, but I already take two different things for chronic physical conditions, and I really do not want to take anymore drugs. I don't like doing anything that I used to do; reading, sports, movies, etc. I have a teenaged son who is just terrific. He is extremely intelligent and just a great kid. I do not want my ""condition"" affecting him anymore than it already has. My wife is sometimes supportive, but I think she is tired of my moods. I have not had the porn problems any longer and I feel like I have gotten past that. (The therapist attributed those times of porn weakness to depression and looking for a way out). I feel like since the counseling sessions that the low grade depression has gotten worse. I am glad that I talked about the things that happened and how I've felt, but I really do feel worse than before. Is there anything I can do besides more drugs? I just don't think those are the answer. Maybe I'm wrong.

"Advice please. Am I in the wrong or is she overreacting? This is going to be a long post!   This is my very first post!   Me (F33) and, now ex best friend (F33) just had a major falling out and she’s blaming me. Here’s a little backstory; We were best friends, did everything together, babysat each others kids and just hung out all the time.  I have 5 kids, she has 2. My youngest are 19 month twins, her youngest is 9 month old girl.   I babysat last for her on Nov 1st. Before dropping her baby off, I always vacuumed because she spent all of her time on the floor. Nothing dangerous in her reach (obviously, I Baby proofed for my kids). She was rolling around and got over by my shoe rack and found something I didn’t see and, like babies do, she stuck it in her mouth. I went over to her and did a finger sweep to remove it but I couldn’t get it and it made her gag; not choke, gag. So I angled her down, patted her back and it fell out. She smiled at me when I turned her right side up, obviously unfazed by what just happened. I stayed calm, and did what needed to be done, no harm. Told mom about it and she seemed unfazed as well and stayed and chatted and left shortly after. Thought everything was fine until just a few nights ago. She sends me a text; that’s right, a text, and basically tells me that I can no longer be trusted to watch her kids and that the state of my house should’ve been a red flag. (My house is lived in, not a pig sty). She said I dropped the ball and let her kid stick something in her mouth and she could’ve choked. Also, I was so nonchalant about telling her about it and that means I was lazy and didn’t see it as a big deal. News flash- it wasn’t a big deal, nothing happened.  She said she wants me to apologize for putting her daughters safety at risk and that basically this friendship is over. I’m sorry but if it’s safe enough for my twins it’s safe enough for her daughter. She found something that I couldn’t see from my view point and stuck it in her mouth. I stayed calm, responded and everything was fine. Should I apologize? Did I do something wrong? She is refusing to talk to me face to face. I don’t feel like I should apologize for something every baby does. I just can’t believe she held onto this for so long. We’ve even hung out since then and she never said anything.

"Despair is the normal state of my life I haven't drank though. I have no urge to drink. I just want to stop.  Stop moving. Just end. I keep picturing myself walking out on my job. Getting kicked out of my apartment. Living in my car. That being repossessed. And eventually ending up in a gutter, wrapped in a a blanket but still freezing to death. Just frozen. Not moving, not willing and thus not physically able to bring myself to it. There is no point to it.  It's never enough. Not matter how much you work, how hard you try, it doesn't work. I don't get ahead. Everything I am, someone is better at it. And anything I do, I can be replaced. And if I do find success by some small measure, I acclimate and find myself just as miserable.

"That feeling of good at night, dread in morning I feel good in the evenings, planning etc.  Come the next morning it's dread and anxiety.  Always had it but in the last three years I've been hit with health, friendship and security issues.  It's definitely aggravated this feeling.  I have to travel to different places for work. But I dread it now.  I'm not in the position to get therapy. I know the issues, not much more than others out there. I've always just kept busy and got on with things. But this dread is getting much worse.  I read it has something to do with the brain not wanting to change all the time. Going places etc. Plus health, security etc. So it makes sense my brain is telling me not to go places.  But, this is life and I need to work. No choice.  Theses days if something negative happens I tumble rapidly. If something positive I inch up a little. Something is not right.   Just wondering how people cope with this?

Bring it On .."" but a little voice from my heart said,""are u serious about this?"" Well .. I dragged myself to Gym because I need to.  Thanks to my supportive girlfriend that said I could be able to do my all kinds of activities much faster from working out since it would stimulate both of your mind and body.

At nite, my girlfriend threw out some matters that almost startled me ... I was surprised but on the other hand I said to myself, it;s really common to have those.   I tried to lessen her burdens, sometimes I do really want to remove all the burdens what she's got but I couldn't ... maybe I am also struggling with the same problem ...  Hopefully someday, the day when we 've matured enough would retrieve the solution. We often discussed many things and if we somewhat hurt one another's feeling, one of us standed up and said sorry. So the problem ended on that day.  Oh ...

"I'm Weakest At Night... I don't understand the reason for this, but for as long as I can remember I've always been weakest during the night time. I feel weak mentally, emotionally, physically, internally... I feel like I can't go on, like I can't keep fighting, like I've had enough... I freeze over, my body locks up, my fear paralyzes me, and my mind becomes my enemy...     Night seems endless because I can't see much of anything no matter where I try to look. From minor fears to worst nightmares stalk me like I'm nothing but an insignificant prey who's time has come. I'm exhausted and need sleep, but only nightmares haunt me or the fear of being attacked while I'm immobile by unconsciousness...    And yet, though a part of me yearns for light, for the warm comfort of the sun, it only depresses me. In the light I can see what I truly am, I can see a reflection of something I've grown to hate. When I look at my reflection I want to smash the mirror so I can no longer see the truth of my insignificant existence. In the light I can see everyone else, either continuing on with their lives without a thought of me or a second glance. Or I see other people like me suffering and it both hurts and gives me a strange, and possibly, a cruel comfort. I hate seeing other's suffer, but I'm so insignificant I am helpless that I might as well be dead...

" Well now that Kerry selected a running mate, the election will start heating up.  My support goes towards are current and great President.  However, I am a little worried about his chances.  Everywhere I turn I hear how so many people hate him, he is constantly getting bashed everywhere you go, and for some reason other than talk shows the GOP isn't fighting back.  This was the same mistake his dad made, and I think this election is too important to lose to someone who has yet to take a stand on any of the major issues (Hey Kerry we know you wouldn't have sent troops, but we are there now so what would you do now if you were in office?) All I can tell people is to actually look at facts instead of read opinions, and at least make an informed decision.

"Advice to restore lost friendship? My cousin and I used to be best friends when we were little. We told each other everything and were inseparable. Then, a bunch of terrible stuff happened to her around middle school and in high school. She shut herself away. Even though we used to tell each other everything, she didn't talk to me as much after that. I love her, and I wanted her to know she could trust me, like she always could. But she didn't talk to me. Or anyone else.   Then she moved a whole state away for a couple years. We drifted apart. Far apart. I used to consider her my very best friend, but at that point I didn't feel that way anymore. She now lives close to me again, and we have started hanging out again. I feel like we are starting to get our friendship back, but I still feel like there is something preventing us from getting back to how we used to be when we were little. She has depression and anxiety as a result of everything she has been through. I want her to know I am there for her and that she can trust me completely.  I do know her well enough that I can tell when she is having a hard time with something, and today, I could tell she was struggling. I asked how she was doing, and she was upset because she and her boyfriend have been fighting a lot lately. I asked her more about it, but she didn't want to talk about it. That's completely fine; I understand. And I told her as much and also let her know I am always here for her if she needs anything.  Now, I say all of that to ask this: how can I let her know that she can open up to me without sounding too pushy? I want to regain what we once had.

So all my 17 years we are poor. Sometimes we live without  electricity because she can't pay in time. In school when there's a road trip to somewhere I don't go and say I don't want to go because I can't afford.

All my 17 years I only eat 2 different food at home..potatoes or pasta.  Because we are poor my teeth are really bad of eating all the shit junk food. I just don't smile anymore. Sooo another problem is I'm stupid just plain stupid I had to repeat classes 2 times  and now I just don't care anymore because i will probably kill myself. I have low self-esteem. I SOO FCKING BAD HATE MYSELF  IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS. So I've got soo many mental problems like ocd, bipolar, depression, anxiety, social anxiety  sometimes I have panic attacks, I have signs of autism and im likely to be asexual. I have only 2 friends who I start to rarely see because I stay at home all day in bed . I have Phimosis too. So my life is just great.

He became more and more distant, he got friends, most of them were verbally abusing me, you would think he would defend me, but he backed up his friends, than his own blood, me  growing up, I was (and still to this day) an introvert, and I never kept a close friend, because they would either stop talking to me, or they would say that they don't like me  and for the 3 years that I have known his friends, they eventually got used to me, and we played online frequently, and 2 months ago, they disapproved of me getting a GTA Shark Card (in game currency) then they insult me saying I need to grow up, and mature, basically telling me how to run my life, and I tried to stand up for myself, but they still kept saying it  Its my life, if I want to act silly, then I will, but the main focus is my cousin, and how he was brutally honest, you know how we hype up our friend to make them feel good about himself/herself?  That's not what he did, every time we play online with one of his friends, he would agree and add insult to injury when his friend makes fun of me, in games... He would tell everyone to go after me, in CoD, he would tell everyone to go to his lobby because he's the ""leader""  but the sole reason I'm making this post, was the fact that he did one of, if not, the RUDEST thing ever, here's how it went  it was my sister's birthday, I was texting, and he said that he's coming to the party, and I'm pretty happy, a smile stretches around my face, I say ""OK cool, :)""  an hour passes by, and he nonchalantly says, ""welp sorry I can't come, oh well"" and I ask why? And he says I don't know, now usually, most would tell the reason why can't come, or if they don't they make up something, but he all of a sudden says, I can't come  I want you keep in mind that, the last time I was in his house, was 4 years ago, and he has only came over for my birthdays or sometime in the fall, so he RARELY comes to my house, and I'm not even allowed back at his house, because of personal reasons  but anyway, he couldn't come to my house, but has time to go to his friends house WHENEVER he wants... Gee? I wonder why? -_-  he did what no other friend should have done, and hurt my feelings all in one fell swoop.

"Hello everyone, I am new here. I am Sarah and in my early thirties. I live in Europe and found this forum today! I just want to share my thoughts and because I was afraid anyone would find out about my feelings I searched for a foreign forum. And found it! I have been struggling all my life but after a series of events (death of dear aunt and suicide attempt off parent) I found myself starting therapy almost 2 years ago. At first everything was fine and I was learning a lot about myself and how to make my life easier and how to love myself. i really was hopeful and thought my life would finally get happier and maybe I would even meet some one to share my life with.... After a year of therapy I started feeling worse about myself and developed an eating disorder and a few months ago I also started feeling more and more depressed. At first I denied everything and even threatened to quit therapy because I was convinced time would heal me....well I now know that healing is not that easy. over the past two weeks I have been to a psychiatrist who wants to start me on Prozac (because it shouldn't make me gain weight, she thinks this would be the best ad. for me) and earlier this week i went to see my usual psychotherapist who said I was severely depressed and she urged me to start taking the medication because of my state of mind. I might loose my job in the near future and with all this extra stress my thoughts have been very scary. I am starting to think more and more about death and for this reason my therapist started talking about hospitalization! Off course I don't want that so I agreed earlier today to start with the medication....I am so scared about the side effects and don't know what i will do if I gain weight. Also I don't think I want to life if I loose my job...I think that will push me over the edge.  I hope I can find the energy to read more messages on this board and maybe get a good feeling about life again.

"Does anybody else go for late night walks hoping you'll walk into someone who's also feeling the same ways?

"I'm 16 and I've thought about suicide some, never tried yet. I'll tell you about myself. I'm in high school ...   just got my license. I've been to two shrinks, neither for depression but a anger problem, though I don't have one, just Mom and me fight and we've always been close. No one has ever known that I've thought of suicide except when I was in junior high and it wasn't really much true, sure a little but I was more agreeing with my cousin when she said that she has thought of such. Now I've been recently noticing (for a small bit months now) how I have been having some I guess you would say symptoms (pardon my spelling) of depression and all. Especially I've been losing interest in things and feeling guilty over everything and that's the most extreme ones, I have some others too. I've taken online tests and it says that I may have depression. But I can't believe I do. I mean why would I have depression. I would just guess I'm making it up to myself or something. We'll I've always been interesting in  psychology stuff like personality disorders, so maybe I'm just reading into it wrong or something. That would probably be what a shrink would say so I don't want to go to one, plus I don't really like talking to them. Another thing is one of my friends just attempted suicide, lucky survived and if I say something to someone they would think I'm just saying such because of that. I've felt like this before that though .... another thing is I'm a Christian and Christians shouldn't feel this way, right? Can someone help me figure out if I'm just making this up in my head!!!",1,thought suicide some tried yet tell myself high school just got license shrink depression anger problem not one just mom fight close known thought suicide junior high not really true sure little agreeing cousin said thought such recently noticing for small bit month now having guess say symptom pardon spelling depression all especially losing thing feeling guilty extreme one too taken online test say depression believe do mean depression just guess making something interesting psychology stuff like personality disorder maybe just reading wrong something probably shrink say not want one plus not really like talking them thing friend just attempted suicide lucky survived say think just saying that felt like thing christian christian not feel way right help figure just making head

"I don’t want to be an adult anymore. I’ve been struggling with my depression a lot lately and I really really wish I could turn to one of my parents to tell them how much I’m struggling. More importantly, I wish I could tell one of them and one of them cared.  I know I’m a decent disappointment to both of them for several reasons.  1) I haven’t had a decent job. I’ve been floating on jobs that get me less than five hours a week.   2) I don’t have friends. Granted, that’s because my mother literally and intentionally isolated me so I have no social skills at all.  3) I have big dreams but zero motivation in life so I can’t even try to achieve them.  So what I’m trying to do is work on myself.   Today I started a new (third, I now have three of these stupid things) job. I thought I did pretty good considering the store didn’t burn down and no one told me that I was a failure. But literally as soon as the sun set, I feel all my doubt and darkness telling that I’m lying to myself. That I’m being naive by thinking that I did well, that I was probably a huge burden to everyone else in the store. But I’m trying, so that has to count for something right? I went and got a third job on my own, so why don’t I feel like I should be proud of myself?  I have no friends. In fact, during 2017, I was so excited to have made a great friend and I was completely betrayed by them. The kind of betrayal where I walked away from a friendship and haven’t bothered reading the apologies they’ve sent me. I’ve tried reconnecting with friend that I had earlier in life, but I’m not doing so well. I feel like they will do something to me and then I’ll lose another friend. And logically, if I’m the only common factor in all my failed friendships, then I must be the problem, right? I must be the problem. I’m the problem. Maybe I’m not meant to have friends.   And I’ve always had big dreams for myself. But because of how I was raised, I have no accountability. Because seriously, why bother trying if everything I do is going to be met with disapproval and anger? So I’ve been trying really hard to make myself follow at least one goal. I chose to go for my art. Problem being that with my depression crashing on me in waves, I’m really struggling to stick to my goal of one art post a day. I’m trying really hard but I’m so afraid that I’ll be the failure I was taught to be.    In all of this, I just really really wish I could quit trying to be an adult and go back to the days when I believed my mom when she said she loved me, I want to go back to when my dad wanted to help me talk things out so I could figure out what I was doing. I want to be able to call my mom up and tell her that I feel like a complete failure and that I can’t add to see my therapist and that I need help talking the darkness down. But if I call her, she’ll one-up me because I’m the biggest mistake of her life. Or worse, she’ll tell me that I should try (fill in the blank with whatever bs Facebook depression fix is trending). I want to be able to call my mom and say hey, I got another job and I’m excited. I want her to tell me that she’s proud of me.   I really want to have a conversation with my dad that doesn’t involve the phrase “well get over it”. ‘Hey dad, I’m full of regret and turmoil’ ‘ugh just get over it’ well excuse me sir for being by the reality that I just pulled a mulan and cut all my hair off so that I could get another job. I went from having shoulder length hair that made me feel good about myself to hair that’s half an inch long and highlights everything about my face that gives me horrible anxiety. Maybe I’m really hurting because I went in to work yesterday and two of my managers greeted me with ‘ew gross, what happened to your hair?’ And now I feel like I’m as ugly as I think I am.  I really miss being a kid when I could pretend that my world wasn’t on fire or that I wasn’t drowning.  And I don’t know how to make any of the darkness back up so that I can breathe.  I really wish that I could see my therapist this week.

"If you care, will you read? My depression has gotten really bad over the last 2 years, and today I realized something. I don't have anyone. Everyone I talk to, people I'd call 'friends' don't really care. They only notice me when I'm the one who talks first. I make plans with them, set up so much and help everyone around me, but none of them care. I skipped school to see what would happen, and nothing. No one even noticed. My parents hate me, and I'm alone. None of this really matters, and no one cares. I'm just so tired, and I want it all to just end.   I don't know why I'm posting this, I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I don't know anything at all. And most of you are just going to look over this and leave. But if you care, will you talk to me?

"Emotionally offline I shouldn’t be writing this, I have three final projects due in the next couple of days and I haven’t started on any of them. But I don’t have the energy to even get started...I don’t know what to do. It’s too late to ask for extensions but I don’t want to fail my classes (that mean nothing to me). Whatever...I guess I’ll turn out fine because I was doing well grade-wise up to this point, but it’s gonna be fucking painful.   Over the course of the last couple of weeks, I feel as if I’ve gone emotionally offline. I feel like a shell of myself. I’m not sure what happened. I think the real downturn started when I was walking on campus two weeks ago and saw my ex-girlfriend of a few months with her new boyfriend, but that’s definitely not the only thing that is bothering me. It might have been a death-by-a-thousand-cuts situation because if I take an itinerary of what’s going on in my life, there isn’t much there.   If my life had a thesis statement, it’d be that I have nothing to look forward to. Hardly any aspect of my life can bring me out of the apathy that I seem to be stuck in every day. I don’t find any of my classes enjoyable, and now the thought of doing it as a career is starting to give me nightmares. I have “friends” but I don’t much enjoy hanging out with them, and overall, any attempts to meet new people just seems to amount to nothing. I have no dating life, and I’m still admittedly stuck on the aforementioned ex-girlfriend (who has completely moved on) that I dated for seven months and have been broken up for the same length. All I can think about is that if she saw me today, barely able to get out of bed and go to school, I’m also certain she would feel even more justified in breaking up with me. I keep thinking about this new person she’s dating and in what ways he is likely a complete upgrade. I don’t even know what their situation is, I am just inventing scenarios in my head. I need to stop that. Fuck.   The only thing I have is that I’m in fairly good shape and my GPA is 3.8 (although that’s certain to go down after this week, which scares the ever-living shit out of me because it feels like the only real thing I can put on my resume). I’m also fairly consistent with working out; it’s not a huge part of my life, but holy shit, if I didn’t do it I can’t imagine how depressed I’d be. Right now, all of the emotional energy I have for the day goes to getting myself to the gym at the least.   With my career, I’m interested in how technology affects people and society; like internet addiction, social media, artificial intelligence, etc. That is kind of what drew me to my major in the first place, which is User Experience Design. However, I do little of that (the research side of things, which includes talking to people and learning their stories, then coming up with conclusions based on that data on how you can improve a digital service) and more the design/development side of things (like visual/graphic/UI design and web development, just building the fucking thing), which I’m good with, but it both stresses me out and bores the shit out of me. I think it’d be fulfilling to be a UX Researcher for a popular social app just because I would be able to study how people interact with it. Or do that for a consultancy/agency or something, and start a blog/podcast about technology+society. I kind of largely detest the Silicon Valley tech utopianism that’s sweeping the country, it seems to be making everyone I know (and myself) unhappy in really subtle ways, but it’s become almost a cult of sorts. I could turn what I learn about user research to that.   But if I want to keep pursuing this path, I have to keep doing the parts that make me depressed (design and coding) for a significant amount of time so I’ve just kind of lost motivation to try at all. I know I should just push through, but I’ve pushed through my whole life and honestly, I’m tired of fucking pushing. Everyone is telling me to keep moving forward because I show talent in it (the design/code side of user experience) and it’s lucrative but fuck man I can only do this for so long. I’d rather use my creativity on music or writing. I have three internship interviews this week which isn’t good to have hanging over my head when I’m asking all of these questions.   I constantly wonder if there is a better, more fulfilling, and less depressing route to the other side of all of this.   The social life issue is more simple, I don’t even want to write about it. I need to be more vulnerable to people and go outside my comfort zone, and that’s gonna take a ton of work no matter how you spin it. The first part of this video with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem is basically my entire life in a nutshell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYCz06bS380. Ditto on the dating life, although that might be a little more complicated. I’ve only even felt attracted to one person since my breakup, so I guess there is more going underneath the surface there. I can’t imagine dating anyone in my current state, but man, the ever-present loneliness really drains me.   Isn’t it ironic though? I want to go into a career where I study people all day, yet I struggle to actually build and establish friendships. I’m like a people’s introvert, it makes no sense.   I seem to use daydreaming and fantasizing as an escape. I spend an embarrassing amount of mental time each day imagining myself as a frontman for a successful band; I really look up to someone like Father John Misty, I feel we have similar sensibilities on a lot of things. And there is just something about pouring your emotions and thoughts into an album, performing it live and connecting with people through that authenticity, that really makes me regret not taking learning music seriously up until this point in my life. I could really use that sort of emotional release right now. Same with writing, when school isn’t consuming every moment of my waking day I like to read a lot, so I’d like to write a book one day on something I care about.   I’m reading what I wrote and it’s kind of frustrating. I clearly have dreams and desires, why can’t I manifest them into anything that makes me remotely proud of myself? Like am I even depressed? I feel like way too many people here have it worse than me for me to complain about my “depression.” Maybe I’m just a shitty person looking for an excuse not to do anything useful with my life.   I’m just trying to make it to Friday. My favorite band is coming to my city and it’s the only thing I’m looking forward to. Its the only reason I am ignoring the thoughts of suicide...I need a break from all this bullshit.   I’m gonna schedule a doctor’s appointment today to get a blood panel done to see if anything’s happening there. I might look into SAD because depression always seems to historically hit me around this time (although this time last year was the happiest I’ve ever been, so I’m not exactly sure). I already see a therapist weekly but I might look for a new one because I’m not sure if we’re making any progress. I’m gonna try to get back into meditation if I can find any time.

I always feel this way around everyone and every group I'm in.

"I'm a [M/17] A guy and I both know each other but never spoke a word, how can I approach him. Before telling you about my problem that I seek advice for, let me tell you about my personality. I don't have any real friends, I just have acquaintances, if you will, people who I see in school mostly and spend some time with occasionally, I find myself to be happier this way since I could focus more on what I like most (Science and music) I basically spend a vast majority of my time alone even when I go out to the cinema or to get dinner I have no one but myself, I was like this since I was a kid, so due to this my social skills aren't great, I turn red most of the times when I speak to new people and just wish I'd turn into a tree just so I could escape the situation. However, I can speak on a stage in front of thousands of people if I had to, as long as it is not a direct interaction or I already know the people I'm speaking with, I am good.  With that said, over the past year, I found myself trapped in a social situation beyond my understanding, I genuinely don't fully understand how this relationship (If you could call it that in the first place) developed in the first place but here is a recap of what happened. A little bit over a year ago in my school. Some guy and I sat around the same table in the library, this happened because the library was packed that day and there was no other place other than that table, so we just sat opposite to eachother not saying a word, and I'm pretty sure each one of us didnt know that the other existed in the first place, days went by and everyday I went to the library I'd sit in the same place and the same goes for him, even when the library was completely empty we'd sit in the exact same place, by this time we knew eachother but never spoke a single word I guess we got used to eachother and if a day went by without one of us being there I'm pretty sure we'd feel a bit blue. By the time we were done with our exams we stopped coming to the library and did not see each other that often until our classes got moved and my homeroom happened to be just opposite of his, and this is where the bollocks started, we got to see one another way more often, In the corridor, the bathroom, on the way out to the buses, and as we passed by eachother, we'd always just stare at eachother still not speaking a single word, we both know eachother but pretended that we didn't. We would find our selves in group conversations since we have mutual friends, we still wouldn't directly speak but if I say a joke he's going to laugh and vice versa. I developed some kind of liking for this guy, I almost consider him to be a friend although we never spoke, I'd like to say hi, but as I said before I will probably turn so red that I'd melt, and even if I was courageous enough and had the social skills to do so I don't even know if he wants to talk maybe he doesn't like me or consider me a friend, maybe I'm just an obnoxious kid he sees way too often. Now we see each other every day in the morning, I don't know how the hell it happens but we go to the restroom at the same exact time in the morning (I guess we both arrive at the same time). So this is a short version of what happened, this is bugging me and I've been losing sleep over it, what do I do?  Sorry for the long post and rubbish grammar (English isn't my first language) Thanks in advance.",0,m guy know spoke word approach him telling problem seek advice for let tell personality not real friend just acquaintance will people school spend time occasionally happier way focus like science music basically spend vast majority time cinema dinner myself like kid social skill not great turn red time speak new people just wish turn tree just escape situation however speak stage thousand people to long not direct interaction know people speaking with good said past year trapped social situation understanding genuinely not fully understand relationship if place developed place recap happened little bit year ago school guy sat table library happened library packed day place table just sat opposite eachother not saying word pretty sure didnt know existed place day went everyday went library sit place go him library completely sit exact place time knew eachother spoke single word guess got used eachother day went pretty sure feel bit blue time exam stopped coming library did not class got moved homeroom happened just opposite his bollock started got way often corridor bathroom way bus passed eachother just stare eachother not speaking single word know eachother pretended did not self group conversation mutual friend not directly speak say joke going laugh vice versa developed kind liking guy consider friend spoke like say hi said probably turn red melt courageous social skill not know want talk maybe doe not like consider friend maybe just obnoxious kid see way often day morning not know hell happens restroom exact time morning i guess arrive time short version happened bugging losing sleep it do sorry long post rubbish grammar english not language thanks advance

"Am I being too harsh? I have a cousin(we'll call him Joe) who is the closest thing I have ever had to a best friend.  We used to do everything together.  Throughout the years we would party our asses off in college, spend holidays together, play video games; literally everything together.  About a year ago, I started to notice that he was making some bad life choices.  Particularly, these bad choices involved drinking and driving, pushing relationships away, and hanging out with the wrong type of people.  At first, it didn't really affect our friendship.  We've always respected each others separate lives when we weren't hanging out.  It was when I started to notice the changes mentioned above that I started to bring it up.  One weekend, the whole friendship imploded.    Some of my friends were coming into town.  Joe was friends with them as well, so I was planning a great time for all of us.  Friday, we went out to a local bar and were all having fun.  Joe has a girlfriend, who wasn't able to join us until the following Saturday morning due to work obligations.  They had been dating for about 3 months, and Joe had been constantly pushing her away, pretending he didn't care about her when I thought she was a stand up gal that could really help him.  That Friday night, Joe ends up making out with an ugly, fat, unnattractive old acquaintenance of ours.  I confronted Joe and told him to cut the shit or I would knock his ass out.  He stopped messing around with the girl and pretended everything was fine.  I confronted him, calling him out for how he chooses to make his life miserable with his actions.  I forced him to tell his girlfriend what he did.  After sending the text, he drove home drunk from the bar.  The next day, Saturday, my friends, Joe, and I all met up at a local event in my hometown.  Joe apologized to me and said he was glad I was there to make things right.  I forgave him and we proceeded to have a great time at the event(which is basically just a big tailgate party).  Near the end of the day, Joe's girlfriend was finally able to show up and join the festivities.  She didn't seem bothered by his actions of the previous night, which made me happy because Joe needed someone like her in his life.  Well, as the evening continued, Joe wouldn't stop drinking.  I kept telling him to take it easy, but it was in his head that he wanted to keep the party going at any rate.  That evening, Joe ditched me and everyone in the group, including his girlfriend, to go to the bars with some random people he met at the local event.  We were all there together, and then he disappeared, gone without a trace or text.  He told his girlfriend to wait in a near by parking lot while he finished partying.  She ended up calling me, crying, asking me to help her find him.  I tried to call Joe multiple times, and was ignored and sent to voicemail.  At this point, I'm full of rage from his actions now and the night prior.  Why would he treat me, his ""best friend"", and his girlfriend like this?  I text him, saying how upset I am and that he needs to be a man and figure his life out becuase he's pushing those closest to him away.  Later that night(around 2AM), I get calls from people at the local event that know me saying that he is making out with random chicks again and eventually was arrested by the police.  They're telling me to come get him before the police take him to jail.  I refuse.  Turned out he didn't actual get arrested(so he claimed), I've never found out the truth of that night.  It's been over a year since I've talked to him.  I don't answer his calls or reply to his texts.  When I go home to my local town, he always texts me and says he wants to come over and visit or that he wants to meet up.  He pretends that his actions didn't completely ruin our friendship.  I demand that he holds himself accountable and changes his lifestyle.  I won't respond to him until he has acknowledged how he has acted and makes an attempt to fix the problem: drinking alchohol and pretending we(closest people in his life) mean nothing to him.  My question:  Am I being too harsh?  Treating him like this breaks my heart.  He was my best friend, we had promised to be each other's best men in our weddings.  I don't know any other way for him to recognize how awful of a person he has become and to help him learn that he can't live his life like this.",0,harsh cousinwe joe closest thing best friend used together year party ass college spend holiday together play video game literally together year ago started notice making bad life choice particularly bad choice involved drinking driving pushing relationship away hanging wrong type people first did not really affect friendship respected separate life not hanging out started notice change mentioned started bring up weekend friendship imploded friend coming town joe friend well planning great time u friday went local bar having fun joe girlfriend not able join following saturday morning work obligation dating month joe constantly pushing away pretending did not care thought stand gal really help him friday night joe end making ugly fat unnattractive old acquaintenance ours confronted joe told cut shit knock as out stopped messing girl pretended fine confronted him calling chooses make life miserable action forced tell girlfriend did sending text drove home drunk bar day saturday friend joe met local event hometown joe apologized said glad make thing right forgave proceeded great time eventwhich basically just big tailgate party near end day joe girlfriend finally able join festivity did not bothered action previous night happy joe needed like life well evening continued joe not stop drinking kept telling easy head wanted party going rate evening joe ditched group including girlfriend bar random people met local event together disappeared gone trace text told girlfriend wait near parking lot finished partying ended calling me cry asking help him tried joe multiple time ignored sent voicemail point rage action night prior treat me best friend girlfriend like this text him saying upset need man figure life becuase pushing closest away later nightaround am call people local event know saying making random chick eventually arrested police telling come police jail refuse turned did not actual arrestedso claimed truth night year talked him not answer call reply text home local town text say want come visit want meet up pretend action did not completely ruin friendship demand hold accountable change lifestyle not respond acknowledged acted make attempt fix problem drinking alchohol pretending weclosest people life mean him question harsh treating like break heart best friend promised best men wedding not know way recognize awful person help learn live life like this

"My Story - There is hope. **TRIGGER WARNING - includes graphic language.**  Hi there, first time posting. I see a lot of posts from high school/college aged people, and being through that myself, all I want to do is reach out and hug them and tell them how special they are. Instead of writing all the typical stuff ""you're so young,"" ""you'll grow out of it,"" ""go see a therapist/take medication,"" etc., I thought I'd share how depression affected me mentally &amp; emotionally and my journey through college. I got to the point where depression was life threatening, and I had given up all hope. I was lucky because my mom (and my dad) were 100% committed to my recovery, even if it meant I deeply hated and resented them at the time. I realize not everyone has that, but in sharing my story, I hope that maybe certain aspects can resonate with people going through the same thing I did and help them not feel so alone.  **How Depression Affected Me**\- trigger warning  It finds a way to connect to memories. To healthy feelings. And twist them into something dark. It craves uncertainty and pain and tells you that you deserve only that. It makes you seek out the deepest crevices of your mind and get lost. To the point where you don’t even know what’s you and what’s the sickness anymore. It almost feels good to indulge because it’s so familiar. We’re taught that enduring pain is somehow one of the most beautiful things a person can do. But what if that pain isn’t real?  In college, I was so afraid of being alone that I wouldn't want guys to leave my room. And there were a fair amount of them. I'd beg them to stay longer and tell them I had separation anxiety. As long as I was focusing on them, I didn't have to focus on me. I justified it by saying that I was 'enjoying' my college experience and 'exploring' my sexuality.   I thought it was normal to not see color, to not ever be excited, to want to drink until my body was as numb as my mind. I wondered how other people could live life with relative stability and thought I was weak for not knowing what they knew. To me, it seemed like common knowledge that life was pointless and ultimately a waste of time. I didn't understand why I was the only one that couldn't cope with that fact. When I was home over a break, I told my mom that I had accepted I would never be happy. When my mom said she was hurt by that, it didn't even occur to me why. I thought I had learned the secret that everyone else knew, the secret that let them go to class or work or see friends or make friends.  Even though by the end of my freshman year, I was cutting myself and promiscuous and drank with the purpose of blacking out so I could have even just an hour of relief from myself, I couldn't admit that I had depression. I thought I felt and acted like that because I was lazy, stupid, slutty, weak. Every semester, my grades slipped a little (or a lot) at a time, and my parents grew more and more disappointed in me. I had been a star student in elementary school, frequently getting the highest scores in class and got into every top middle &amp; high school. I felt like such a failure. At this point, my parents sent me to a very expensive therapist, which ultimately was a waste of money because all I did was bend the truth to hide every aspect of myself and life. I don't think I could have even been honest even if I wanted to at this point.  The first semester of my junior year, these thoughts grew too heavy. I didn't want to be there anymore. I wanted to be nowhere, not awake, not asleep, not alive, not dead. I spent my time with people that encouraged all my doubts, and I pushed away people that cared. I rarely went to class and even if I did, I scraped by on the assignments. I lived for the moments of escape when I could go to parties and drink and hook up with guys, no matter how repelled I was by them. Outside of those few hours of escape, I couldn't sleep. I never went to the cafeteria with friends or even to get a real meal. I only ate Lean Cuisines that my parents had bought me at the beginning of the year. When I ran out, I ate solely Pizza Rolls and peanut M&amp;Ms. I didn't do laundry once in those few months and barely took showers. The only time I put any effort into my personal appearance was when I went to a party because all I wanted was to be perceived as ""carefree"" and ""sexy,"" not the lazy slob that I thought I was. Even then, I wore wildly inappropriate clothing compared to what everyone else at my college wore - one time a girl yelled out to me, ""You're going to get raped!"" Another said judgmentally to a friend, ""She's not wearing pants."" (I was wearing sequined booty shorts, okay). My only happy moments that semester were with a boy that then tried to sexually assault me with a visiting alumnus. His excuse was that he wanted to get into the alumnus' frat by impressing that brother. When he tried to apologize the next morning, I told him he shouldn't apologize. I was so disconnected from my body, I didn't even view it as mine anymore. After that, I didn't blame him and still spent most of my 'free' time with him. (Free meaning when I wasn't laying on my bed trying to gather enough strength to even leave my room, going to a party or the rare occasion I went to class or very very rarely attended a sorority event.)  My last night at that school, my theory that I had borderline personality disorder was weighing on me. I had been thinking about it for a couple of weeks after I had finally figured out that my behavior and thoughts were not the typical college experience, thanks to my extremely honest roommate &amp; sorority sister. She told me that other girls in the sorority thought I was trying to ""fuck with their guy friends"" and slept with too many people. I tried to go to the student health center earlier that day. When I stated, ""I think I have borderline personality disorder,"" they just said, ""What do you want us to do?"" The only action they were equipped to take was to call the on-duty counselor who had to drive 40 minutes to get to campus. When I told her about my self harm and drinking and promiscuity she replied, ""How does that make you different than any other student?"" This further cemented my past notion that I was just weak: the numbness and loneliness - the desire to feel anything at all - was normal, and I just had a huge character flaw by not having the strength to be 'normal.'   That night I got wasted and tried to swallow a whole bottle of caffeine pills at my friend's house. My intention was to induce a heart attack. He was one of the only people that I knew understood what I was feeling, but I never got a chance to tell him how close to the edge I was since his freshman girlfriend and two of her friends were with him that night. Not that it was his responsibility, but I just wanted confirmation that something wasn't right with me. While I was at his house, I tried to stay true to my 'carefree,' 'fun' person that I tried so hard portray while his girlfriend and her friends complimented my shirt and hair. It made me feel like such a fraud. Towards the end of the night, after I had swallowed those pills, my friend tried to get me to throw them up and then drove me to my dorm where I couldn't even find my room. I stumbled around and ran into the RA that had just gotten out of the shower and clung to him. I was scared and confused and felt so alone. I eventually got to my room and started cutting my already scarred wrist with baby scissors. I tried to cut into my femoral artery with those scissors as well, which was entirely unsuccessful. I settled for cutting my knee. At that moment, campus safety knocked on the door. I kept calm when they asked their usual questions, ""Have you been drinking tonight?,"" etc., until they asked me to show them my wrists. That's when I panicked. Started screaming and crying uncontrollably. They escorted me to their office. I later learned one of the officers asked my roommate if I slept around. While I was incoherently yelling, an officer handed me a phone. It was my mom, and I cried that a death of a young man I knew in high school was my fault, and that I could have done something. (Background: His death wasn't my fault in any conceivable way. He OD'ed. I barely knew him &amp; didn't even know he was an addict, but I had a huge crush on him at the time and never acted on it. Through my warped logic, if I had been braver and talked to him, I could have 'saved' him.)   The next day she was at my school ready to pick me up. She had flown on the next available flight to get to me. When I returned home, I went through months of therapy and psychiatry and yoga and meditation all arranged all by my mom. In the beginning, I was okay. Broken down and exhausted but seemingly on the mend. On some level, I was relieved that I had finally been diagnosed with something (went from depression to bipolar II to a depressive mood disorder). I worked really hard with my therapist to understand my guilt, disgust and trauma, which ironically had been entirely driven by ways I tried to cope with my depression. However, fully expecting to go back to college for the next semester, I was informed that I was not allowed to return yet. When I chose to leave in the middle of the semester, the dean didn't share the information that they had never let a student return from health leave until after six months of treatment. I had withdrawn from all my classes and sacrificed a semester's worth of my parents money thinking that I would be returning shortly and only a semester behind.  After that initial blow, my parents eventually gave me more freedom, I met and got involved with a guy that got me more into substances. He was going through issues of his own, which is why I connected with him. One morning, my parents tried to wake me up but couldn't. No need to go into further detail, but it was one step forward and two steps back (I no longer wanted to be 'nowhere' but was now using... alcohol... frequently). Despite alcohol being one of my main coping mechanisms, I was fortunate not to develop any dependencies or addictions.  A handful of months later, after my parents had taken away my phone and forced me to be supervised by them every night, I was accepted into a local university. I had also found a new therapist and psychiatrist. Their words stuck to me: 1) ""Depression sucks and it most likely will be with you forever but there are ways of treating it."" and 2) ""You get to a point in your recovery where you can't blame your depression anymore. You just have to stand up and do your homework/go to your job/go to class."" I was also lucky enough to have a couple professors that understood on a basic level what I was going through. One told me to show up to class no matter how miserable I was. I didn't bother to explain that depression wasn't about being miserable, but from there on out I did everything within my emotional power to go to class, even if I had drank before (that happened a couple times) or didn't participate (happened almost every time). I ended up getting a C or D in the class, but I take that as a win since I easily could have failed. Another professor asked student services to reach out to me after I hadn't shown up to class a couple weeks in a row. I learned there will be a lot of people that don't get it and don't want to get it, but the one or two that do make all the difference in the world.  Throughout my time at the new university, there were a lot of ups (meeting a close friend and actually making personal connections with people, excelling at the courses in my major) and downs (failing multiple classes and having to proactively withdraw due to 'special circumstances,' finishing an entire bottle of wine in an hour, crying and writing gibberish about how guilty I felt then inviting some random 30 year old I had met on Tinder over to my dorm room), but slowly I was piecing it together. I eventually got an on-campus job, then a full time internship then a full-time job.  While I'm not perfect these days, I've been at a job I never would have dreamed of for the past two and half years and have gotten a promotion.  Still, sometimes when the depression gets the best of me, I think that’s who I really am. This broken, beaten down person that's ashamed of basically her entire young adulthood. I fear that I don't want anything of substance. That I can’t find anything of substance. That I don't even know what I want. No path. No passion. When it gets that bad, it takes every ounce of strength I have to fight it.   Even on good days, I can feel like it's in the back my mind. I'm terrified that it will come back, and I won't be able to control it. I'll give in to the thoughts that say I'm not good enough. You'll never be good enough. Everything you've dared to want will slip through your fingers, and you won't even know. All I do is think about how far I've come from that girl who swallowed a dozen caffeine pills. That girl who  thought she'd never be happy. And it gives me just enough strength to deny those feelings and smile.  I hope this wasn't too personal, but I wanted to be as raw and honest as possible.

"There is a genetic weakness in my family - virtually everyone has been on medications at some time, or is on medications now, for depression and anxiety disorders. It seems to onset around puberty.

"I am not able to do breath meditation myself, so I'm a fine one to talk, but I've read that it works. The thoughts will come, no matter what you do. Supposedly the trick with breath mediation is that it gives you distance on the thoughts, helps you ""stand back"" from them a bit, and feel the accompanying emotions but not get as carried away by them. This reinforces your ability to know that they're just thoughts, and they will go away if you don't act on them. And supposedly either with breath meditation or without, there's an element of ""fake it till you make it"" at work here. It's been shown that ""acting out anger"" as a therapeutic tool actually makes getting angry easier than letting go of it, because it maintains the neurological pathways that anger uses. One meditation teacher calls it ""rehearsing anger"". So supposedly if you replace negative thoughts/feelings with positive ones, like caring for the part of you that is angry and hurt, then eventually your brain will reprogram itself to think and feel positive things. Breath meditation has become a non-religious phenomenon in recent years, like yoga. Three books that are just good reading anyway are ""The Art of Happiness"" by the psychiatrist Howard Cutler with the Dalai Lama, ""Destructive Emotions - How Can We Overcome Them?"", by the psychologist Daniel Goleman with the Dalai Lama, and ""Anger- Wisdom For Cooling The Flames"", by Thich Nhat Hanh, all of which discuss breath meditation as a simple practice for ""mental hygiene"" as opposed to a ""religious practice"" of any sort. Supposedly the Dalai Lama was really surprised to hear that ""self-loathing"" is common in Western culture, because it was so uncommon in Tibet- there was just no concept. The point of all this is, with or without meditation, is that if you notice a negative thought or emotion when it arises, rather than struggle with it to try to put it out of your mind, you should just quietly label it as ""negative thought"" and let it go away, and/or replace it with a positive thought, like ""caring for the wounded child within you"". (It's odd to notice that John Bradshaw, the ""king"" of ""healing the wounded child"", and Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, say the same thing about this.) But it's being said that there's a great similarity between Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and meditation practice, because meditation practice recognizes negative self-talk and replaces it with positive self-talk, and supposedly conditions the brain to react in positive ways. In ""Destructive Emotions"" there's a part about brain imaging that shows that people who meditate are activating more positive parts of their brains. And again, these books are just good reading anyway. But like I say, easier said than done. Supposedly it works for some people. I can't do it, but some people can. Maybe you can. If nothing else, all these works, including Bradshaw, are good reading and you may be able to develop positive mental habits and replace the negative mental habits with them. Both breath meditation and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy have been shown to be good adjuncts to recovery from depression, even if the depression itself is being treated with medication.",1,not able breath meditation myself fine talk read work thought come matter do supposedly trick breath mediation give distance thought help stand back bit feel accompanying emotion not carried away them reinforces ability know just thought away not act them supposedly breath meditation without element fake till make it work here shown acting anger therapeutic tool actually make getting angry easier letting it maintains neurological pathway anger us meditation teacher call rehearsing anger supposedly replace negative thoughtsfeelings positive one like caring angry hurt eventually brain reprogram think feel positive thing breath meditation nonreligious phenomenon recent year like yoga book just good reading the art happiness psychiatrist howard cutler dalai lama destructive emotion overcome them psychologist daniel goleman dalai lama anger wisdom cooling flame thich nhat hanh discus breath meditation simple practice mental hygiene opposed religious practice sort supposedly dalai lama really surprised hear selfloathing common western culture uncommon tibet just concept point is meditation notice negative thought emotion arises struggle try mind just quietly label negative thought let away andor replace positive thought like caring wounded child you it odd notice john bradshaw king healing wounded child thich nhat hanh vietnamese buddhist monk say thing this said great similarity cognitive behavioral therapy meditation practice meditation practice recognizes negative selftalk replaces positive selftalk supposedly condition brain react positive way destructive emotion brain imaging show people meditate activating positive part brain again book just good reading anyway like say easier said done supposedly work people it people can maybe can else work including bradshaw good reading able develop positive mental habit replace negative mental habit them breath meditation cognitive behavioral therapy shown good adjunct recovery depression depression treated medication
"How do I keep from being jealous of my very successful best friend? So, I've been die-hard friends with this girl for about 4 years. Our friendship has been through SO MUCH during that time: the death of her father, relationships and breakups, we've worked several jobs together and lived together. We jokingly call each other ""husband and wife""!  She's an artist by practice and (through her inheritance) has the ability to not have to work a full time job and simply practice art. She's getting recognized internationally and is also just started as the creative director at a local female owned bar/art house.  I am SUPER excited to see her doing all these things and I ALWAYS go to the openings of her events and show support when I can. I have traveled with her to art shows and helped set up her booth.  Recently, I've had several bad dreams about her. In one dream, I was choking her and screaming in her face. In my dream last night, I was stalking her, trying to find out if she was ""cheating on me"".  I think what I'm most jealous of is her freedom while I'm chained to a desk job all day.  How do I address this so that I don't end up being resentful for her success! I feel like I'm being left behind.  TL;DR I'm jealous of my successful friend and want to stop.

"my cousin Long story short, I have an 8 year old cousin and I don't like him. I'm 19 going on 20 by the way. My mom babysat him when he was a newborn till when he was about 2. I always felt kind of jealous because my mom completely forgot about my dad and I when she babysat him but I always kind of understood that she wasn't doing it intentionally because kids are so high maintenance at that age. Anyways, fast forward to my teen years and his young kid years and I can't stand the kid. He's such a crybaby even for his age and he doesn't like me for some reason. It started because he was taking toys from my dog and my dog started crying, so I yelled at the kid and he started to cry. I don't think I was being over the top and the kid definitely had to have someone discipline him. My mom loves him a lot and always talks about him but it pisses me off because it seems like she cares about him and his dad more than her own husband and only son. The kid does nothing but play video games on his xbox or my mom's iPad when he stays with us, Which I failed to mention is a very common occurrence. I'm starting to ramble but the main goal of this post was to find out if anyone feels the same way about any of their younger family members or if I'm just a complete asshole.

"My mom has changed since marrying her new husband. I’m a college student, still living at home with my mom, going to school and working part time. I help pay some bills, I help around the house and do errands when I can. Since this new guy moved in with us it doesn’t feel like a family anymore.  When they do grocery shopping he writes my moms name all over what is HER food. This never happened before and I really never even touched her food to begin with so I find it really rude and unnecessary.   When they buy dinner, they bring back food for everyone except me. (My younger brother lives with us too). And they tend to go out to dinner without asking if I want to go.   I don’t know, I’m venting but I’d also like other people’s opinions on this.

" Hello world!   Yes, well... umm... I've just started this journal, as you could probably tell, and I'm aiming to use it to record life as it is now for me. As for most journals, I haven't put this online to 'show it off' per say- I'm using Blogger because it's very accessible and so I can come back to memories and thoughts that I might well have forgotten in years to come. However, comments and everything are very welcome!   I hope that I'll be welcomed here well enough- I'm currently working on a layout of some kind that might come sooner or later... We'll have to wait and see!   Well, I suppose that first journal entries include a bit about the journaler, so I'll introduce myself, shall I? My name is Jennifer, but on the internet I go by the alias of Myth, I'm currently 16 and studying in 11th grade at a school in Brisbane, Australia. I'm more of a nerd than not, I guess you can say, but that's mainly because I need to study really hard to get where I want in life (in terms of a career) as I would like to become a physiotherapist, but I'm quite good at a variety of different things- I can write stories and poetry, draw to some extent and even defend myself, as I learn a martial art called  Ju Jitsu . My parents are separated, but I see them both equally, so it isn't that bad a deal, and I have two brothers- one twin brother and one half brother, who's currently six. He (the latter) is really cute, but he's also terribly annoying and (in m opinion) a little spoilt.   I like to RP (RolePlay), mainly the online kind, so you can often find me in the RP sections of forums, or MUSHing on sites like  Elendor , but most of my time is lately spent in study or at Ju Jitsu training, which is really very fun, despite all the bruises.   Well, that's about all I can think of at the moment, so I'll be off and I'll post sometime later! I plan to try a very different style of journal writing, so I'll see what I can come up with!

"No friends whatsoever. Living in isolation. Please help me I'm in my final semester of undergrad. I'm 24. I live in a university apartment. I have severe social anxiety. I've gone through therapy before, stopped for a while, and am now trying to find a new therapist that takes my insurance.   Every day is almost total isolation. I go to class. I fantasize about working up the courage to talk to someone or say something in class but never do. I go back to my apartment. My randomly assigned roommates, all several years younger than me, keep to themselves. I am too afraid to talk to them. So I hole up in my small room and play video games or do homework. Day in. Day out. Rinse. Repeat. This has been my life for several years now.   I'm incredibly insecure. I have some combination of body dysmorphia and an eating disorder. I'm probably quite good looking but I've never been in a relationship; I'm still a kissless virgin. This eats me alive and makes me afraid to talk to women. Another reason to isolate further.  I'm losing touch with reality. I have loving parents but their advice isn't particularly helpful. What I want is a friend, someone to talk to--but the anxiety gets in the way. I can talk to people in a structured setting, like therapy, or online (and easily and freely at that). But it's the act of doing it in the real world, in a natural setting, that is just impossible.   I fantasize a lot about killing myself though I don't think I could ever actually carry it out. If someone could just be there for me I'd feel better. But I've given up almost all hope.",1,friend whatsoever living isolation help final semester undergrad live university apartment severe social anxiety gone therapy before stopped while trying new therapist take insurance day total isolation class fantasize working courage talk say class do apartment randomly assigned roommate year younger me themselves afraid talk them hole small room play video game homework day in day out rinse repeat life year now incredibly insecure combination body dysmorphia eating disorder probably quite good looking relationship kissless virgin eats alive make afraid talk woman reason isolate further losing touch reality loving parent advice not particularly helpful want friend talk tobut anxiety get way talk people structured setting like therapy online and easily freely that act doing real world natural setting just impossible fantasize lot killing not think actually carry out just feel better given hope

"There is a big chance that I will become a millionaire in a year or 2 I got involved in Bitcoin 2 years ago, bought a lot when it was 500 600 dollars. And based on my bitcoin increasing from trading altcoins and the increasing value in general I believe I can seriously become a millionaire in a year or 2. I am depressed though. I want to figure out how I can reinvest that money. Not for the purpose to make more but how I can make other aspects of my life better. I'd really like to hear what people think.  And also I don't really know how to feel about this. I think it's important to be humble and I never want that to change about me. But I am going to become very wealthy. I have a certain perspective on money.  Money isn't evil, it is a resource. It's power, you can use it for good or bad. I want to become a billionaire. You can save and dramatically change 1,000s of peoples of lives with that amount of money. I'd rather have that power than someone who doesn't have that perspective.  Does this make sense? I just feel this way about money. I feel like people think it's evil and pursuing money is evil. But you can do good things with money. And I want to do that.  How should I feel and think about this?

My friend is making me extremely uncomfortable lately. Should I remove them from my life? I’m a teenager and I have a online friend that had been making me uncomfortable lately. She asked me to call her at about 12am because she was afraid of the thunderstorm she heard and when we got on the phone she started flirting with me. I passed it off as playfulness as she has a boyfriend but she continued. She started moaning my name over and over and exposed one of her breasts. When I asked her why she said it was ‘cute how I reacted and funny’. I have no interest in her at all and I expressed this; she apologised over text but I’m still very uncomfortable talking to her.

"Obesity Is Killing Our Friendship Context - I'm 21 F, my friend is 24 F.  Both students living alone.  Obesity related health issues don't just run in her family - they've killed almost half her relatives. Six years ago, she ate fine, sure she was ""curvy"" but that was her build, her nature. She went on walks with her friends. Now she can barely make it to her front door. Her cousin - in his teens - died recently from heart failure. Weight related.  Yet, she continues to put on weight, eat awful food - like taking home meat double burgers from mc donalds and then re-frying them at home, for breakfast, plus sweets, every day - and also taking energy drinks all day followed by sleeping pills at night. That is, physically, killing her according to her doctors, but there's where our issues as friends start.  What's killing out friendship is her desperation - but absolute lack of effort - when it comes to loosing weight. She talks about switching back to eating the things that, when we first met, she loved - banana breakfast smoothies and chicken schnitzel. She even did a Go Fund Me for a stomach reduction surgery. Has seen more nutritionists than I knew existed. Yet whatever happens, she only eats more, or worse. She was told to stop eating pringles, and replace them with a healthy alternative like corn wafers but instead, she swapped them for deep fried pork buns. And so on.  Friends have always offered to help, to buddy up, to go with. I've been on diets she ditched the first day. I've been to the gym only to have her ""go bathroom"" out the front door. Everyone else gave up.  It doesn't help that her family, Fijian-Indians, seem to see food as the only way to show love. The early years, when she actually tried to diet, they'd constantly bring her fatty treats because they thought she looked too skinny. And of course, she'd eat them. And they'd bring more.  I have seen her go through almost four years of pretending she'll try. I've gotten so excited and so happy and so hopeful only to have it thrown in my face. I love her, but in all honesty, I don't want to keep waiting and watching for her to die. Because that's what the diagnosis has been for the past 6 months - change her life, or die from complications. But all she does is whine about being fat, and then ask me to order in pizza.   What would you do?  I don't want to continue to watch her kill herself, but I can't think of anything I can possibly do to help her change.",0,obesity killing friendship context f friend f student living alone obesity related health issue not just run family killed half relative year ago ate fine sure curvy build nature went walk friend barely make door cousin teen died recently heart failure weight related yet continues weight eat awful food like taking home meat double burger mc donalds refrying home breakfast plus sweet day taking energy drink day followed sleeping pill night is physically killing according doctor issue friend start killing friendship desperation absolute lack effort come loosing weight talk switching eating thing that met loved banana breakfast smoothy chicken schnitzel did fund stomach reduction surgery seen nutritionist knew existed happens eats more worse told stop eating pringles replace healthy alternative like corn wafer instead swapped deep fried pork bun on friend offered help buddy up with diet ditched day gym go bathroom door gave up doe not help family fijianindians food way love early year actually tried diet constantly bring fatty treat thought looked skinny course eat them bring more seen year pretending try gotten excited happy hopeful thrown face love her honesty not want waiting watching die diagnosis past month change life die complication doe whine fat ask order pizza do not want continue watch kill herself think possibly help change

"Just some curious questions here. I am recently undergoing lots of stress in my life. My work is failing and I am struggling keeping up. I recently have a new born in the family as well and extra workload at home too. I noticed these few symptoms:1) Often worrying, going in a loop worrying even about small things 2) Very easily agitated, get angry very easy 3) Weird sleeping pattern, can't sleep at night and sleep 10-12 hours straight during the day 4) Hard to concentrate at anything serious, easily distracted 5) Have up and down moments, sometimes it feels as though nothing has happened, sometimes it hits hard and I could waste one whole day just sitting at home being totally non productive. 6) Easily give up at everything I do, everything seems to be hopeless at times. I am putting off going to the doctors for a long time now. I previously been to the doctors and was given 2 different kind of antidepressants and I really felt awful taking them and stopped. I am reluctant going back because of the same reason. Is this a serious matter that warrants me to see the doctor again? Just hate the feeling but I noticed the ""downs"" have been coming on more and more lately due to more stress load. Please advice, and if possible give some advice concerning the medication I am most likely to be given if I go to the doctors as well...thank you.",1,just curious question here recently undergoing lot stress life work failing struggling keeping up recently new born family extra workload home too noticed symptom worrying going loop worrying small thing easily agitated angry easy weird sleeping pattern sleep night sleep hour straight day hard concentrate serious easily distracted moment feel happened hit hard waste day just sitting home totally non productive easily do hopeless time putting going doctor long time now previously doctor given different kind antidepressant really felt awful taking stopped reluctant going reason matter warrant doctor again just hate feeling noticed down coming lately stress load advice possible advice concerning medication likely given doctor wellthank you
" So here I am...one of those people who likes to hide behind who they really are...someone who is afraid to express their honest opinions because they don't want to hurt anyone. But this is fun because there isn't a single person (well, okay, except maybe my sister), who know that this is really me. Let the fun begin!!!  To give you a better idea of who I am and what I like, I figured that I would start out with some websites that I check frequently. I get my basic news headlines here: www.usatoday.com. I also really like the sight because it has a lot of entertainment news and fun chats so when I am really bored at work, I can bug people besides my coworkers (which is a word that I have never really liked because every time I look at it, I only see the word ""cow."" Granted, some of my coworkers have been along the ""cow"" lines, but still...that is just mean).  I am applying to law school for the fall- mostly because I don't know what else to do and I am actually entertained by the thought of spending 3 more years in school. So I check out www.review.com, www.lawschooldiscussion.com, www.xoxohth.com, and www.lawschoolnumbers.com for some up to date information. Okay, so I am actually really excited about going to law school. I know that millions of people are doing it- so I thought that I would be one of those millions. No, just kidding... I know that the job market will be tough when I get out but it is tough right now and I can't stand my job. Why not get more edu-ma-ca-tion? It is almost funny...I haven't told my friends that I am going to law school. I have good reason but that is definitely something for another entry.  I love to travel and like to check out www.elliott.org for info about deals and new travel news.   I also check out www.eonline.com for celebrity news- yes, I am one of those people. But I have to live vicariously through someone so why not someone beautiful, thin, rich, and famous?!?  Okay, enough for today...I am sure that this is not interesting to most people but it is a lot of fun for me to write and I am sure that it will allow me some creative genuis. Have fun!

" I have had it up to here! If you want to know what my life is like today, here it is in a nutshell: My name is Claire, I've just finished my GCSE exams (thank God!) I'm going to Oxford this weekend, and I am worried, stressed and pissed off simultaneously.  My brother Martin is a drug addict who has made my family's lives a living hell for the past 4 or 5 years. He is 15 in August. My parents are separated, and my dad has a heart condition. One more severe heart attack and he could die. Martin broke into my dad's neighbors house where they live in Aldridge, and now the police are looking for him.   They have just broken into my dad's house to search for him, and my dad's landlady has just called to tell him at work, so he's on his way home to do some damage control. I'm worried because my dad could get evicted as he is only renting the house, and he has worked really hard on doing it up so it will be a reasonable place to live in. He has been looking for a house for ages, but everything that seems to go right usually gets screwed up by my darling bastard little brother, so I don't know why I'm so surprised. At last count, my brother has been expelled from 3 schools and 1 college, and he hasn't attended school properly since he was about twelve.   There you have it. My fabulous life. I can't trust anyone completely in my life except for one person, who will not be named here. She is my rock to lean on, and I don't know what I'd do without her sometimes. I'm also annoyed because I don't trust any of my other friends enough to leave them in my room when they are staying over, because I think they will look for my private stuff. My songs, my stories... I have to hide everything private in my room every time they are there, and so even though people can read this I'm safe because none of my friends even know what a blog actually is. I know I sound like a melodramatic little whiner but this is seriously what my life is like. Between me and all my friends, we have enough problems to end up on Oprah or a similar show on a regular basis. This blog will be my way of telling our stories respectively.

She's 11 now and loves me. I read a story online about a dog passing away and I thought ""if little Dixie goes, I'll go too."" And it took hours before I realized that I don't think I'm kidding. I work only so that bills get paid. I'll never pay off my student loan debt. If I go soon, my nephew won't have any memories of me.    I'm crying on my couch.

"As you live life and learn new things you grow more mature. Life is not about growing up and making plans for tomorrow, it's about enjoying every moment as you're living. Happiness is the most important thing and people have forgotten that. The world is full of so many interesting things that all cost money and we believe having a lot of something is the key to happiness. And since money is the thing that buys us the things we want we sort of become obsessed with getting as much of it as we can. In my mom and my situation we've tasted what money can buy us and we don't want to go back to the way things used to be. But the thing is we were both happy then and now we're not. I've learned money cannot buy happiness. My dad and Julie don't have much money and they are happy. There is something we can all say we regret from our lives. I regret regretting. Everyday I've lived has come to this moment and even after all the things that have gone wrong recently, I can pretty much say I'm happy with they way my life has turned out. I'm happy with who I am behind my mask. I am happy with what I know and what I want to know. Lately I've been wanting to die. Actually no, I wanted to want to die. Depression is all about seeing those bad moments and ignoring the good times in your life. When you're depressed the only thing that matters are the bad times. I don't think I was stupid for wanting to want to die. When something goes wrong you tend to act out of spite as soon as it happens because you are so overwhelmed with the moment. Most people do this - it doesn't mean we're stupid it just means we got carried away and we sometimes do things without thinking. Now I'm starting to realize that the break up with Scott was a good thing. We were forcing something that wasn't making either of us happy. Of course I didn't think about either him or me and our happiness I just wanted to keep us together for as long as possible. Besides I have too many other things going on in my life right now that I need to work on and if we were still together I would have ignored these things. I don't want to become one of those people who throw their entire lives in their online journal so I won't go into everything that is going on with me. If you're my friend you know. I'm through acting like someone else in order to please people. This is my life and I'm the one living it. Other people won't be around my whole life but I will so therefore I'm putting myself and my happiness first. No more staying in one place because I'm afraid of change. I want to experience as much as I can because to me that is what life is all about. No more dwelling on the past it can't be changed - move onto today that's were things are happening and decisions need to be made. I don't want to slip off the road by looking the wrong way like I did on my driving test which by the way I failed. But that's ok, there's always next Thursday. OK enough with the things I've already learned and experienced. Onto new things, new places, and new people. I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself and wanting to be someone else. I'm going to be me again and do what makes me happy. I'm going to take advantage of the help I'm getting and I'm going to help myself get better and not depend on others to save me. And I'm also sorry to Scott, one of the reasons why I was so dependent on you was because you helped me and I thought you could save me entirely and make all the bad things go away. I now realize I'm the only one who can do that. I'm sorry I turned you into my therapist. I'm through with the break inside my hole, time to climb out.",1,live life learn new thing grow mature life not growing making plan tomorrow enjoying moment living happiness important thing people forgotten that world interesting thing cost money believe having lot key happiness money thing buy thing want sort obsessed getting can mom situation tasted money buy not want way thing used be thing happy not learned money buy happiness dad julie not money happy say regret life regret regretting everyday lived come moment thing gone wrong recently pretty say happy way life turned out happy mask happy know want know lately wanting die actually no wanted want die depression seeing bad moment ignoring good time life depressed thing matter bad time not think stupid wanting want die go wrong tend act spite soon happens overwhelmed moment people doe not mean stupid just mean got carried away thing thinking starting realize break scott good thing forcing not making happy course did not think happiness just wanted long possible thing going life right need work ignored thing not want people throw entire life online journal not going me friend know acting like order people life living it people not life putting happiness first staying place afraid change want experience life about dwelling past changed today thing happening decision need made not want slip road looking wrong way like did driving test way failed ok thursday ok thing learned experienced new thing new place new people tired feeling sorry wanting else going make happy going advantage help getting going help better not depend save me sorry scott reason dependent helped thought save entirely make bad thing away realize that sorry turned therapist break inside hole time climb out
" Hi there.  I don't plan on telling anyone I know about this blog spot. Fuck it. I have been on an eating binge since Friday.   On Friday I ate mushrooms and had an awesome time hanging out with some people I am just getting to know. It does seem however that I am not going to be hooking up with one of the girls like I had hoped.  Which makes about 31 times in a row for me to fall into that gray area called the friend with no benefits zone.   I am going to be a dick from now on.  Not that I feel like a dick but I don't want to be disappointed  by some shitty friendship where I get to hear some girl cry about her exotic exboy friend.  Fuck him.  That pillow biter. Fuck her.  I cover the tabs and she knows why.  Once a month she might pretend she wants me over after he neglects to call her because he is getting it some where else. And God forbid I summon the courage to bust a move.  Even on an eight of strong mushrooms I can't put aside my cowardice and at least offend someone with my rotten cigarette breath kisses.  I had gum.  My trip lasted way longer than everyone else and she clearly did not want me to even sleep on her couch but I couldn't just up and drive home, i was seeing 8 of everything and they were all melting.  I did feel bad wandering around the tiny apartment zapped out of my mind while she slept.  I did bug out at the beginning of the night.  There were about 45 minutes to an hour where I could not bring myself to say one word.  I think everyone else was starting to think that either I was retarded, angry with them, or even more retarded.  Lucky I did break out with some good material and get some good laughs.  So did my friend's cousin,  she also had some funny moments.  I keep sending weird text messages this girl.  I even called her and left a message with the excuse that I couldn't find my wallet just so she would call me back and tell me it wasn't at her apartment.  but to most people this probably isn't a new trick.  what is wrong with me.  why don't girls like me?

" I was traumatized today.      It was horrible.       Mom let me outside to play. I was having a grand old time. I teased the hamsters in their cage. The little balls of fluff just hate it when I paw the bars. They puff up and jab at me. Little buggers have a heck of a bite when the catch ya though.      When that got boring I spent a little time hunting bugs, though I have be careful to stay away from the rock garden and the flowers that attract the best bugs.      After my belly was full I started my rounds and was on the far side of the house when I was suddenly soaked. Rain came out of nowhere and I just got drenched. I had to sit and cry at the back door screen for five whole minutes before mom let me in so I could dry off in my bed.      I am still a little damp. I am not sure I will recover anytime soon.      I heard mom say that it is supposed to rain all week. I think I will stay inside, no matter how much I crave a good crunchy bug.

"Songs for children :) Hello!  I recently launched a YouTube channel with fun videos for children and I'd like some feedback on the content, and I thought it would be a good idea to get feedback from parents or big sisters/brothers, etc. And if you also have suggestions as to what kind of content would be fun and educational for children I'd love to hear them.   I am writing these songs so I basically decide what the story and the animation will be about.

"Hello, I'm Yevgenny, 21 years old, and have suffered from depression for...well...I guess as long as I can remember. I started having suicidal thoughts when I was 9, but strangely enough, I can't remember having at that age any concept of suicide. I've been placed on practically all of the antidepressants over the years (with the exception of MAOIs), and am currently taking Cymbalta--no real side effects, seems effective enough. My father died when I was 18, but that in itself wasn't so sad. Last September, I had a sudden thought regarding my feelings about his death, and I found the most heartbreaking aspect was, like I said, not the fact that he died, but that the process of dying was for him degrading and humiliating. Like me, he was very independent--if he needed help with something, he considered himself defeated; he was content in his own world, like I am, but the magnitude of something like death forced people into his world...those intangible connections between ourselves and others, between him and others, seemed to chain him down. When I had my last breakdown in September, I couldn't stop myself from imagining it; to find yourself suddenly and wholly dependent on others, and for them to force themselves into your mind, your world, and find for themselves some memory or happy relic to take with them such that even your most private, perhaps sacred thoughts and memories are wrenched from you. I thought about what it must've been like to know with certainty that death was all that was left, the helplessness of not being able to face your own future without someone either doing it for you or having earlier robbed you of the existential will power to do it. I attempted to hang myself after my morning classes. I'm not sure how, but before kicking the chair away, I forced myself to call someone because the world is so huge, and I've only had the chance to see such a small part of it, to die then, would've been so meaningless and empty--the very things I was attempting to escape, meaninglessness and emptiness. The friend I called left work immediately and came to me. She cried in one afternoon more than I ever have, and she wasn't even the depressed one. So, fast forward to today. Did some inpatient care. I'm seeing a therapist whom I trust, respect, and have thus far been unable to outwit (it's a good thing.) On a physiological basis, the medication is helping. Psychologically however, I've got some work to do. Ignoring biological/chemical factors, in order for me to be happy, I need to find/build/understand the meaning of my life. I do not believe that man is born with an inherent raison d'etre, or that one is given to him by some divine entity; rather, I believe that the meaning of one's life is self-constructed and in continual flux, it is something you work on, something you subsist upon, and yet is something that is always just out of reach, or one brush stroke undone. Not an easy job. But last week I was on my front porch at around 4pm having a cigarette (I'm keeping this habit for now.) Everything was still, the air still cold with winter but with traces of spring on every tree, the clouds were lit from below and the west, it was like a painting; but it was this oddly static scene that gave me the most lucid understanding of myself, that unstoppable, dynamic thing we call self. And so, more than ever before, I'm going to take treatment seriously and honestly; even if there is sadness, those chance moments of serenity that make up for in intensity what they lack in length, in those instances I think I will find meaning, no, I already have, I suppose. I apologize for how lengthy this became, but I'm guessing it was somehow necessary for me to say. I'm looking forward to talking with the other members of the forum, as I don't think I've ever talked to others who were depressed. Even if I don't find much help here, there might be someone who finds such help in me. Thanks! And, again, I'll try to keep future posts shorter, but in my defense, sometimes when I write I don't feel in control...oh, starting to go off again.

"Nice to see you too!!! How are you today? I think you really have hit the mark on what I was trying to express with this question - all the negativity and darkness that is contained in almost every media outlet you can name. The disasters you mention, such real human tragedy but the way the media went after it was appalling and seemed to be muddled in politics and ratings. As for those forensic shows - ugh! I used to be able to watch them but way before this recent ""episode"" of mine I stopped. I couldn't stand the heartache of knowing what evil lurks out there. Where I work now one of the first friends I made was a gentleman who has since retired. He told me that he didn't read the news, watch TV or listen to the radio (except for light jazz) because he found that to do so was just too much pain, it did not ""serve"" him to subject himself to that kind of pain. He seemed to be generally very happy and upbeat to me so there must be something to it. As for your friend - that's a tough one but maybe since she is your friend she might understand if you explain to her how incredibly painful her TV choices are on you. Does she ever read or post here? Anyway, it is GREAT talking with you again and I look forward to the next chat. I hope you have a wonderful day and weekend.",1,nice too today think really hit mark trying express question negativity darkness contained medium outlet name disaster mention real human tragedy way medium went appalling muddled politics rating forensic show ugh used able watch way recent episode stopped not stand heartache knowing evil lurks there work friend gentleman retired told did not read news watch tv listen radio except light jazz just pain did not serve subject kind pain generally happy upbeat it friend tough maybe friend understand explain incredibly painful tv choice you doe read post here anyway great talking look forward chat hope wonderful day weekend
"I used to know exactly what I wanted to do in life, but now when I look foreword all I see is eventual suicide. My whole life I’ve wanted to go enroll in Animal Studies at NYU to eventually get a degree in zoology. It’s been my dream for as long as I remember. I was going to get good grades, get my driver’s license at 16, stay in shape, eat healthy, get married, have kids, earn enough scholarships that most of my college was paid for, and get a job that I loved. Basically be the perfect woman. But now, everything seems so impossible. I’m currently failing most of my classes because I can’t find the motivation to do assignments, which causes anxiety to wrack up even more than usual. It’s just been awful. Anyways, when I try to look foreword once again that my young, stupid self had planned out when she was little, all I can see is... nothing. I just want to be clear that the only reason I’m still on this earth is that I know suicide would crush my family. I want help, I really do, but my pride won’t let me ask. And even though I (temporarily) decided to live, the call of the peace after death still calls out to me. It reminds me of our past flirting through the angry wounds criss-crossing my arms and the knife bloodied with my own blood under my mattress. I just want, more than anything, for this pitiful excuse of an existence to end.

"Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad? Well I often do, quite sometimes frankly. I just miss those good old days, when life was just so beautiful and easy. Nothing to worry about, nothing to cry for other than silly childish little things.  My childhood was so beautiful. It was in France. It's been now a whole decade since I left France - the country I've always admired and will always do. I remember going to school, having so many friends, I felt like I'm the happiest child on Earth.  Then suddenly one day, everything changed. The passing of time took away from me my childhood, my friends, my beloved France. Life suddenly just changed like that. No more joy, no more innocence, no more real friends, no more homeland. No more beautiful sunny days, only darkness, depression, nostalgia and tears.  I'm trying to survive day by day through this hell on Earth. Each time those memories of my childhood flashbacks, I can't help stopping the tears that drop from my eyes. Whenever someone mentions France, I get overwhelmed.   I'm living the hardest time of my life. A 10-year ""war in lifetime"", as I call it, still going on, and doesn't seem to have an end soon. I know those good old times are just memories, obviously. Tomorrow when I wake up, things will be just the same. But my hope will never die. My redemption will come, soon or late. This moment of my life will also be just memories, just like those good old days of my childhood in France.  I didn't go in detail 'cause I don't think many people will be interested in my story. But if you are, I wouldn't mind sharing you the whole story, as long as you can share me yours.  And how about you?

"Just a little update - my temporary $8 an hour job was the foot in the door I needed. Two weeks later and I'm on day one of a higher paying, with benefits, permanent job with these people. Granted it's still in the same agency as my last job down here, but different division. It's good though that I can just walk down the street during lunch and have lunch with the girls from my old office. I did miss them and their good gossip. By my birthday in September we'll all be in the same building, we move in August and they do on my birthday, so that'll be fun! While I was pregnant I was sure I'd want to be a stay at home mom. After having Toby I thought I did then as well... 6 months later and I was dying to get out of the house and back to work. I do miss him but I don't envy my husband's job of taking care of him and the house and our pacifier business while I get rest at work. I get to have lunch, take my time and go to the bathroom when I need to, and talk to real adults about non baby stuff in non baby speak. And the best part - I'm getting out of the house!

" I am learning to listen to God's voice. Sometimes he speaks in a voice so small, I have to stop what I am doing just to listen. Like this morning, I had this feeling to pray for my husband. I had to stop what I was doing and pray. I prayed until the feeling left. I don't know if he was in danger or not, but God lead me to pray for him right then and there. Sometimes I wonder what would happen if I no longer listened to His voice. I don't think I am going to take that chance to find out.  I watched Jurassic Park 3 last night. I know, I am one of those people that actually like the movies. I really enjoyed number 3. It was a little different from the others. More action packed. My husband called me in the middle of it and told me I should be studying my insurance books instead of watching a movie. Well, he is right, but I finished the movie anyway.

"I feel like the friendship I have is fake on her behalf I have known this girl for going on 7 years. I am not the type of person that has many friends, or is very sociable. I try to keep to myself and mind my own business, and don’t care to hag out with people. We met at work, and I liked that there was so much that we had in common, almost like I could see myself in her. We became friends. However, there has been a few instances that make me question her friendship.  We are both waitresses, and she would ask me how my night was and how much I made. It made me feel a bit uncomfortable, because the way she asked seemed a bit odd. If I would make more than her she would seem a little upset, if she made more, she seemed to be happy. Even now when I make more than her she says “I hate you”. She says I’m her “best friend” and gets mad if I hang out with someone else without her knowing, tag/get tagged by other people on FB, or go places without inviting her. Although, she does all of these things as well, but I don’t get upset or mention them. When we started working at a different restaurant, right off the bat, there were people that didn’t like me. These are people that are problematic, and always cause drama (which I cannot tolerate). Well, my friend knowing that these people talked behind my back, hated me, and made up rumors about me, decided to invite on them to her house! At that moment I realized that this fakeness was not just in my mind! My friend likes a lot of attention, she gets upset when she doesn’t get it, or when I do; my friend likes to judge other people’s body’s (she’s taller 5’6”, thin); my friend sees every imperfection in others; My friend expects me to invite her out, buy her treats, bring her things to work, but she has never offered to do the same for me (although she does it for others); my friend posted 5 emojis on my fb wall on my birthday (😘🎉 🎂👭💃) I  always congratulate her and wish her well; My friend calls me her “bestie”..... how real is this friendship for her??   I forgot to mention that I always try to give her Christmas/birthday presents according to what she likes(mostly earrings or pretty blouses/dresses), she rarely gives me gifts (which is fine, I don’t expect anything in return) but when she does, it’s something that has nothing to do with me (like a size large red and blue Superman-logo hoodie.

"How do you talk about depression to your friends? I'm really ashamed of not necessarily the depression in and of itself but the way that I have acted with it and the way that I have (so far) failed to overcome its clutches.  This shame has led to me neglecting some relationships because I don't know how to talk about this without seeming really pathetic, which makes me feel even more guilty for neglecting friends that I actually do value, but just can't bring myself to talk to.  So how do you talk about this in a way that seems... I don't know - like - valid?  I don't know what to say.  I've been depressed and unemployed for over a year and now I have a friend calling me and I know that I should talk to them (I even *want* to talk to them - like they're awesome and I really really want them to be in my life again) but the thought of trying to explain myself - it makes me feel sick and disgusting to even contemplate.  What would you say? Does anyone have any good answers to this?   I really need advice right now.

"Thank You ArtChick and Tempesta , all of you who have been here for me. I'm so glad that you all understand. I really want to get out from behind this trapped door. My life is so controlled and he doesn't even see it. He denies it when i bring it up. I cry because i can't buy things for my children or grandchildren. This isn't the way it is suppose to be. One of the reasons I don't make it to church on some Sundays is because I don't have clothes to wear. I have a pair of black jeans i keep switching jackets and shirts so i don't look the same every Sunday. My daughter bought me a nice dress and it was warm enough last Sunday to wear it. I guess i shouldn't care about what people think and all the people at my church are wonderful, not judgmental. I do go to the Lord in Prayer every morning and study my Bible. I feel content because we are supposed to give all our worries to him and not get in his way of taking care of them. I know God is working in my life, my daughter finding this site is just one of the ways i know. my husband just got a job after being out of work for a year. I prayed for that too. He didn't just get a job but he got a good job. I told him he didn't get it on his own. I know I am going to get better eventually. Thank all of you for being here for me.

"Best friend has a bf and is MIA I want to start a thread for people who have best friends/friends who have been MIA as a possible result from having a bf/gf. Please share your stories and give advice to those who post.   So here’s my story:   So my best friend of five years has had a boyfriend for over a year now. However, she’s recently been MIA. There has been times where I hadn’t seen her for two weeks or maybe a month, but this time it was a lot more. Despite living a few minutes away from me, I hadn’t seen her in 2 months!! Every time I asked her to hang out she would say that she was busy, but she wouldn’t suggest meeting another time. We barely texted around this time either, I was the one that mostly initiated the conversations. Although she was busy, she was able to meet up with her boyfriend plenty of times who happens to live an hour away from her. She would always post photos of them together in social media and I would honestly feel upset. Eventually, I asked her to hang out again and she said that she had plans to go to the movies that night with someone else(not her bf), but that I could join. So we went to the movies and she dropped me off to my house right after the movie because she had to wake up early the next day. So we didn’t really talk (since it’s the movies) and I couldn’t address how I felt about not seeing her since there was someone else there as well. Also, the only reason I saw her that one time is because I asked her to hang out. If I hadn’t texted her, then she wouldn’t have invited me and I wouldn’t have seen her. After that I didn’t see her for a while either and I wanted to meet with her in person so that I could speak to her. A couple weeks later we finally saw each other. The first thing I told her was how I felt upset because I felt like she wasn’t making much of an effort to even talk to me or see me. I told her that we should see each other more and she agreed. She then caught me off guard by stopping me and saying “I know what you’re going to say.” She claims that she knew and that she had been feeling guilty for the past months. She then said that those months were kind of hectic because her bf was going through something. But that’s it... she didn’t apologize and it just doesn’t sit right with me. All she said was how she felt guilty and then mentioned something about her boyfriend to justify her behavior for the past months. We hung out for a couple of hours, however her bf kept calling her and she’d answer his calls during this time. She’d recently gone on a short vacation and I didn’t know when she’d returned to town until I saw a photo on Instagram of her and her boyfriend together. I’m honestly very mad and I feel as though I can’t say anything because I had already mentioned it. What pisses me off more is when she had just gone on vacation for two days and posted a photo of her boyfriend on social media with the caption “It’s only been 2 days and I miss you sooo much!!” Like are you seriously kidding me, you hadn’t seen your friend in more than two months... I’m honestly so mad and I feel like I can’t tell her without her getting mad. She’ll probably get defensive since it involves her bf and since I mentioned it before. She’s honestly the only best friend I have and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m starting to resent them and I don’t want to. Is there any advice that anyone can give me?

" so first and foremost i have to give credit to nichole who brought me up to 2004 and introduced me to this whole blog thing. i have a feeling i am going to become an addict.   so i signed up for this and they asked me to fill out a profile and then proceeded to cut and paste whatever they wanted out of it. example, i wrote a whole paragraph about how i was so happy that they made the question ""name your favorite books"" because usually it just asks for one but then proceeds to ask for your favorite TV showS. i capitalize the S because they want it to be plural. as if you should be watching more TV and reading less. i guess it's easier and most people filling out these surveys are not interested in writing for hours about their favorite reads, but instead about what happened last night in nick and jessica. actually i could tell you because secretly kate and i watch it and then wonder what it would be like if MTV came and filmed us....i'll leaving wanting more only because my point of this is i am being censored in the wrong way. you see i promote reading and educating yourself, you know seeking the truth, finding your own path and they cut that shit out. what the f**k? oh i just realized this is correct, oh my bad this is the new interpretation of the first ammendment. sorry thanks for the correction. i forgot we are all suppose to be getting our news from FOX and nevermind the independent thinking it wears on the brain, let someone else do it for you. okay nevermind, just disregard what i just wrote and recommence status quo.  so already i love this blog thing except i don't think anyone is going to read it. but it's okay i already feel better, it's like free therapy...i mean someone may read it and laugh or think oh this poor girl, how pathetic...but whatever i can write about all my shit and if kate wants to catch up on what i am thinking (because she always says, ""i don't know what you are thinking"") she can log on and read instead of strong arming me into watching nick and jessica.

I am tired of spending every weekend crying. It didn't used to be this bad. I was fine being alone and forgotten. I don't know what changed though. I guess it all just caught up to me.

"Feeling trapped in my head First off I'm Autistic, I'm studying at Oxford I'm struggling to remember anything, like anything at all, people, faces, dates, facts, etc. I'm feeling more and more alone because I don't feel like I have anything good to think about. I have a girlfriend, she's in the forces and has a lot of structure and meaning to her life and I like that but I see my life as completely pointless.    So about a year I was cycling in the dark and I was hit by a car, I flew over the bonnet and hit my head. I was out for about half an hour, till I regained conscience in the back of an ambulance, and the crews were cutting off my clothes and pumping me full of morphine. Before this accident I had a very good memory, and my parent would say I could talk about anything that had happened from when I was a child. I was having some weird relationships at the time with different people, and I only came out to them after I was in hospital for a month after the accident, I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to worry them. I valued their feeling more over my own life, and I still do that now with other people.   Things started to crash after the accident, I lost people really good friends and I knew it was me, and I changed and something during that accident had altered me, and I hated it. I started to forget people very quickly and events that had happened and horribly people who had died and continuously not realising they had died. That upset a lot of people. Before everything happened I had broken up with a girl (but i didn't realise that after), now I can't remember what we did together or even how we met, but I can't get the thought of her out my head, she later told me to leave never come back, which I did. But even now I still have the feeling of thought of her, and I'm struggling to get rid of that, I don't love her and I'm not in love her, I just feel like i'm obsessed with her a person I know nothing about and It haunts me.   I've been to a few separate doctors and have been recommended medication, which I believe it has just made it worse. I've talk to my parents but they just talk highly of the pro's of medication and councillors. Hate councillors. (I always ended up lying to them)   Since everything I've had some real down point, and made two attempts, by failed due to people walking in randomly either whilst in progress or while setting up. I've already made necessary precautions by writing letters, addressing them and stamping them but non have been sent. I want to tell my gf but I feel like, I don't want to throw feelings away by her thinking 'he's a sobbing kid, or he's crazy or why am I with him' - I'd rather hide it not to upset her, people mean everything in the world to me, and I'd give my life for her, any day. But I still want to tell her, and I don't her to be scared of me.   When I close my eyes and think of a memory, I just see grey mist or static like of a television. It doesn't feel nice not having anything to fall back on in your mind, things that made you happy.

" Why is it that when ever something goes wrong or when there is some one to blame I seem to be the one every one turns to. I don't know if it is just me or if there is othere people who feel this way. For me it is hard to deal with and its sad to say, but i'm actullay not looking forward to summer vaction.

To me it seems that know matter what i do or what i say i feel like I can never do anything right.

" Well... I am unsure how to start this new blogging stuff...guess I will just reflect a little and see how it goes.  Have you ever been stuck in a matrix? I have! To me it was like being in a padded, suspended time warp during the early part of  my adult life. A time that lasted over 12 years. That shouldn’t happen to anyone...and shouldn’t have happen to me. But it did. I was 23 , a new single mom...no friends...no job...and not much family to speak of. I had to make money and take care of my son... I couldn’t afford to live on my own so me and my child stayed with my parents... I went back to school and learned a vocation. Then... tried for years and years to make a difference...be somebody and amount to something for my sons sake...the matrix I was in got thicker and harder to escape from...I couldn’t do enough for anyone. My parents, my employer, so called friends, relatives.... it was like total non-acceptance...I felt laughed at and demeaned.  (Like a RedHeaded Step Child.)  I had a vision of the way I wanted my life and it wasn’t happening. Feeling like every move I made no matter how positive only enabled those around me to throw dirt on my emotions and aspirations and even me. They would throw dirt on me! Spreading slanderous rumor making ugly innuendo... I would try and try to ignore and endure.  Oh!Gaud; How did I get there?  So much time had gone by in this continuum...my ideas were lost. Buried in the gook and gum of this matrix intra-cellular structure...  I got really  mad  one day and more or less threw my hands up in despare...then... feeling terribly,terribly  angry ... I suddenly broke free from the matrix by desiding right then and there ...That I was going to make a move. A move that would  change  my life and those that went with me for the better.  The  anger  did it...I was fed up...I had gotten to the point where I hated everyone around me...I had to get out or die trying...  It took alot out of me. It was a draining yet somehow refreshing experience.... In a way I was reborn...a new beginning... a time to be  me  and a very liberating change...  I had escaped.... It was my Independance Day...

"My male cousin stopped talking to me all of sudden. Let's call my cousin Bobby.  My mother is the oldest daugther and my aunt (her sister, and Bobby's mother) is the youngest, with an age gap of 15 years old and even though they weren't really close (my mom moved to another province when she turned 18 and didn't came back to where we live now until she was 43, 2 years after my birth), we used to see each other at least 2 times in a week. I'm an only child while he is the youngest of 2 sons and since he's only 3 years older than me, my mom and my aunt thought it'd be nice to make us spend time together. We got close, really close and were like inseparable. But when he turned 12 or 13, he did stop talking to me, all of sudden. He doesn't say hi to me when he and his family visit us. Hell, he doesn't even look at me when I open the door. A year ago, during New Year's Eve, we were sitting in front of each other during dinner and I was staring at him because he looks really good now that he lost the acne. He noticed what I was doing so I moved my gaze to one of my cousin's baby and when I looked back at him, he avoided my gaze.  I told my friends about him and they say that he must be embarrassed about something but I dunno about what or why since he never did something weird or bad to me.   All of my other relatives told me he would start talking to me again when he got older and mature. But oh surprise: he is now 20 and at college, and he still doesn't talk to me and avoid my gaze.

"Hi all, I'm new - just joined yesterday. I'm a 40-year-old wife and mother of five. I've struggled with depression my whole life - came from an abusive household and inherited some mixed-up genes. I was misdiagnosed last year with bi-polar II and spent a year on mood stabilizers and various other junk that made me a zombie. I'm now on Effexor and just beginning to feel sort of like myself again. I'm a freelance writer and I have a weekly column in our local newspaper. I feel like my creativity has gone to pot and I'm waiting for it to come back. Over the last 18 months I've become pretty reclusive - don't answer the phone, don't get out much, just take care of the basic family needs each day - so I've felt very alone. I stumbled upon this site while doing research on Effexor. I've read a lot of the posts and have felt some hope that this might be helpful to me right now. My husband is worn out, as am I. I just want to be better. I want to be a better mother. I don't want to live my life this way. I've felt like half a person for the last 18 months. I want to be whole again. I'm really struggling with self-esteem and guilt - I worry about what all of this is doing to my family. I hope and pray that my children are strong enough to go through this with me. Anyway, that's me, in a nutshell. I'm glad I found this place.",1,hi all new just joined yesterday yearold wife mother five struggled depression life came abusive household inherited mixedup gene misdiagnosed year bipolar ii spent year mood stabilizer various junk zombie effexor just beginning feel sort like again freelance writer weekly column local newspaper feel like creativity gone pot waiting come back month pretty reclusive not answer phone not much just care basic family need day felt alone stumbled site doing research effexor read lot post felt hope helpful right now husband worn out i just want better want better mother not want live life way felt like half person month want again really struggling selfesteem guilt worry doing family hope pray child strong me anyway me nutshell glad place

" Christ. This weekend kinda epitomised what my summer will be like. I don't think B wants to know me any longer, after no pickups and four calls... I don't think I'm on the top of peoples lists right now. When the others get on their school break, they're off to Poland which shall leave me here, back to square one. But, so I hope, when they return a real summer shall commence. [I can only keep my fingers crossed so much]. V gets back from work this evening, but I doubt I'll be seeing him if he gets back in the early hours. I guess next week will be spent in a coffee shop, drinking soft drinks and a cigarette in one hand - as per...  I don't know why I have such  great expectations of the Summer. I think it all stems from the Green days - when I was Mr. Popular. Well, so it seemed. Then that faded out and I was left with another lot of people...now im just hoping that doesn't fade out. I don't think it will.  But, there is a new prospect ahead of me, a'course. New school, new people, new faces, new opportunites blah x 3.

" Adventures always start in the most unlikely ways. A random email from someone with the courage to think outside the box ( thanks Si!) has tempted me to dip my toes in the world of the weblog. I don't know where this will lead, if anywhere, but a chance to unjumble some of the thoughts racing round my head can only be a good thing! I think everyone reaches a point where they have to stop and say, is this really the life that God has mapped out for me or am I just imposing his hand on my own faltering steps down the expected path. It's not that I think I'm in the wrong place physically, I just think maybe I'm on the wrong level. I think the catalyst has been the birth of my daughter. Two big blue eyes watch every move I make with unnerving concentration, taking in the things other people may have glossed over in the past. Suddenly I realise that what I say may count for very little as, seeing everything, she's going to see the truth. Don't get me wrong, there are lots of positives, I'm just ready for more. I suppose I'm just looking for a way to let my mind spill on to the screen and see if what lands there starts to make some sense!

"Does anyone else ""live inside their head""? Hi, this is my first ever post.   I feel like I'm living in my head 99% of the time. I catch myself forming conversations in my head between me and other people. It's pretty obvious because my lips move and I tend to smile when this happens. (A couple of my friends have pointed this out) Sometimes, the conversations are just between me and myself. I feel very numb during this whole process. The topic of these ""conversations"" revolve around feeling worthless in every aspect. It feels like life is against me. I'm average in every way (looks, intelligence, skills). I feel like I will never amount to anything. I just do things to get them over with, just so that I can continue to keep to myself and get stuck in my head like this. I don't have pride in any non-school/school project or assignment I do. Even things that should be enjoyable, like going out with friends doesn't really do anything for me. It feels as if nothing brings me joy, except numbing myself out from everyone else.",1,doe live inside head hi post feel like living head time catch forming conversation head people pretty obvious lip tend smile happens a couple friend pointed out sometimes conversation just myself feel numb process topic conversation revolve feeling worthless aspect feel like life me average way look intelligence skill feel like anything just thing with just continue stuck head like this not pride nonschoolschool project assignment do thing enjoyable like going friend doe not really me feel brings joy numbing else
" I heard about a couple of jobs at work I applied for the other day. I didn't receive an interview. I'm pretty dissappointed about it, I thought my application was quite good... I was never expecting to get either of the jobs, there are people at work who definitely deserve them more than I but it is still a sensation not dissimiliar to a kick in the teeth. All my friends rallied around to make me feel better but of course when you feel like that there is very little someone can do to help. It's a matter of stewing for a few days and then getting over it, I am becoming a master this year it seems. I offered my application to my friends at work for there opinion, they all said it was pretty good, but I only got a truly honest opinion from one, my good friend anthony, he told me that while it was good, I used passive language which they warn you against, I really appreciate his honesty, you have to respect it. I think he might be one of those friends you meet rarely that you should try and hold on to for the rest of your life.. you can't waste a good friend. I actually feel the bunch of guys I've met in the last couple of years while working where I am, are the best I have ever made, they are not like some of the friends I had in high school who seem to use when appropriate and forget you at other times and I honestly don't think they ever thought about it, or the friends they are unwilling or just unable to share any emotions deeper than a bottle of beer with you.. at some point you must grow up.  I was told by Anthony the other day when he read this for the first time that adnd is an old acronym for Dungeons and Dragons dating back to 2nd Edition and that die-hards upon reading my first post would pick me up on it... and I have to say if that is so, then you really must start doing something more than dnd with your life, okay!

"My friends acting dumb and I don’t know what to do? So I have a “friend”. Let’s call this “friend” B. I’ve known B for most of my school life (we didn’t talk from K to 5th grade bc different classes and moving away). In 6th grade she was the only friend I had in academic classes and we both formed a squad (spoiler: it didn’t last). Essentially we were very close and have a lot of inside jokes.  Starting last April, B started ignoring me after I told her I wanted to do an assignment sheet alone. She took it the wrong way and we ended up fighting the entire break. We made up quickly and life was normal again. Another long ass fight happened over the summer for unknown reason. Then in November, I saw B at Target with someone she hated (lets call her E) at the time (B still does). What pissed me off that B fucking cat-fished E the same week. Again, made up 2 weeks later.  She’s probably the only friend that actually asks to hang out with me (I have other friends btw). B likes to play these ditching pranks when I would leave then B and her other friends would leave me. She’s also destroyed my stuff after I told her no. One of my other friends (let’s call her A) told me that she was obsessed with me that every time when hanging out with B, B would mention me and it creeps me out. I don’t know how to deal with the friendship since I’m scared to deal with B. Any advice?  TLDR: My friend is toxic and obsessed with me.

"I'm a 23 yr old university student and I think I'm getting depressed again. One of the debates I'm having with myself is whether or not this is really depression. I was diagnosed with it about 2 years or so ago (although it wasn't my first bout of feeling low) and was put on a high dosage of medications (which I took). Things got better after a few months and so of course I stopped taking them cold turkey. Obviously not the best idea in the world, aside from this being one of the worst things to do because of the possibility of reoccurrence, my body went through heck and I had some pretty nasty side effects (even worse than when I was actually taking the meds). Fortunately, it didn't reoccur and I've been feeling fine until the past couple of months. I think I'm feeling the warning signs again: low energy, crying, circular thinking, apathy towards everything, skipping school, sleeping all day, anxiety ... I just feel like maybe this isn't really depression, maybe I'm just a person who doesn't handle stress well. Jeeze, when I read this it sounds so ridiculous. Part of me knows I'm being illogical but another part is just blaming me for being weak and not being able to just sit back and enjoy life. Why can't I just be happy? Why do I have to be so moody? Why am I so weak? It's stupid but I keep blaming myself. I don't think I'm bipolar since I've never experienced real highs but every couple of years or so my lows get really low. Last time was by far the worst and I wouldn't have been able to get through it without medications and I don't want it to get to that point again but ... I guess I still feel a lot of shame about it. It still feels like depression is being weak. I know, I know it's just like having diabetes and your body needs the chemicals to be normal but *sigh* I still blame myself.

Nicolas again doesn't want to be in the room... SOOO We walk around again but for this time it's at least an hour.

Today we went for a meeting with our landlord and discussing the smell of weed coming from the flat below.

"Is my sister (31) a toxic person, am I (28m) overreacting? Should i confront her or should i talk to a specialist for a peace of mind? Hello, 28 male. I'll try to be as brief as possible. I've never been very close with my sister. We talk and communicate and help each other (lately I'm the one helping) but I've never really... connected with her. In a few words - if she wasn't my sister I would've never consider her a friend or someone worth keeping close to me. As a child she was very abusive (maybe not the best word) in terms of getting what she wanted - tantrums, fights, screaming, being the centre of attention - you name it. Later on in her teen years she had constant fights with our parents over staying late at parties and so on. She was grounded more than a handful of times during that period. Over the years her attitude stayed the same. She has no qualms about burning bridges with people. Friends, family - you name it. If she gets in a fight with someone she would never stop and think twice before saying something that she may regret later on. Like an animal that's being threatened - bite, bite, bite. This would often lead to tentions in our family as she and the other party won't speak for couple of weeks. She has a child now (1.5y.o.) and the poor kid is truning out to be a real brat. We would go over to her house and the kid is throwing tantrums all over the place. She says ""well, he wants to sleep"" but won't go to the other room with him. In the meantime the kid is touching the food, throwing forks and we are all trying to keep all the food, beverages, our phones and what not away from him and she would say somehthing like: ""well, yea, the fun of being a parent. You'll see when you have one, ha ha"". Such a fun. And she is really obsessive. She's the one that does the talking. At this point I know everything about pregnancy, childbirth, brestfeeding, nutrition, whats good and whats bad for the kid. She and the kid are in every conversation. Some one would say ""I didn't get to clean the house this weekend"". Well guess what? She didn't get to clean the house too, because of the kid. ""Wow, house cleaning... Yeah, haven't done that in a while now. But you really can't, once you have a kid. You'll see"". She is lacking friends and communication, I can tell. All she talks about is some Facebook groups with other mothers that we don't know. We have never heard of them, we are not bothered to but here we are - we know about some random mom and her kid's sleep schedule, eating habits, inside jokes we don't really appreciate or care to. And if its not her and the kid in the centre of attention its her and my BIL fighting over stupid, stupid shit that I don't want to hear or know about. And its not only me - my gf, our parents, mutual friends and so on. We are so deep in that shit, that some of our mutual friends are making excuses to avoid them. And my sister's answer? ""Oh, they'll see! Things are gonna change between us and them. I'll see them when they have a kid"" We (me and my GF) are avoiding them too, as much as possible! But if you confront her you better be ready to go to war. She can't handle critisism. To her this means a fight. And if  get in a fight with her you better be ready for a throwdown and to hear some bad shit about yourself. Thruth is I don't want to confront her to spare my self all the drama. The yelling, the tantrums, her playing the victim how hard it is, seeking support and involving my mother for example.... It probably is hard. Sure is. But after more than six months of me helping them with their house renovation, using my car as a truck or taxi, depending on what they need (building materials, groceries, doctor appointments etc you name it) I'm kinda sick of it and lost! I really can't tell - am i overreacting over this? If not - should I confront her and hope that she will take my criticism as an adult. I'm really thinking of seeing a specialist seeking an advices and peace of mind.  Sorry for the rant!

"Today is my 21st birthday. I'm spending it alone with a bottle of wine. Birthdays have always been a bit of a sore spot for me. To quote a very old comment of mine,   ""13th birthday: I had just been let out of a mental hospital a few days before. My mother finds out she has a brain tumor. My only friend at the time gets sick and goes home early.  14th birthday: All my friends but one bail on me. My parents scream at each other until my mother packs up and leaves.  16th birthday: My family and I go out to dinner to a restaurant that my dad chose solely because he had a coupon for it and buys the world's smallest birthday cake. Halfway through my birthday celebration the following weekend my friends abandon me due some drama bullshit that was apparently more important than me.  17th birthday : Dad starts an argument in the middle of a restaurant in front of my best friend. After we get home, the argument continues, resulting in my dad physically attacking my mother. All while my friend and I sat in my bedroom.""  To add to that, my friend's mother died of a heart attack on my 18th birthday, and I spent my 20th alone due to the fact that all of my old high school friends had moved on and my best friend had decided to join the military. Well, today was my 21st. My best and only friend completely forgot about me. My dad then made me have an emotional meltdown. Now it is nearly midnight and my only company is the nearly empty bottle of wine sitting next to me, so I am not only sad, but also slightly drunk.

"My twenty year old sister died instantly in a car accident in march of 2005. It has been almost a year, and i have never had a dream about her, until tonight. In the dream, she goes from one family member to another, asking why we are ignoring her. She is extremely upset, and screaming that she doesn't understand. She sees me, starts toward me; and then i wake up. The overall sensation of the dream is that she stayed behind to take care of her fifteen month old daughter, and to give birth to the son she was pregnant with when she died. The strongest thing i picked up from the dream was the sensation that she doesn't know she's dead. Is there any meaning behind this dream?

" Geuss what? I just realised how great I am at reviewing movies. Remember when I saw that one about the British ravers who contacted the undead via an Oujia [I've never had to spell that word] board? The one about the kids who snorted coke [cocaine, for those of you who aren't Ma-, er, down with the street speak] off train tracks when, wait for it, A TRAIN WAS COMING?  I also liked how they had sex, and the girl's shirt was on inside out for the rest of the film. Oh, but I wish I had seen all of it. Obviously, something that starts off like that must have a grand finale. But my mum wrestled the remote off me with a stern ""No more tacky B-grade films about British punks!""  But they weren't punks, mum. They were ravers.  The whole experiance left me hungary for more B-grade films. The 'B' in 'B- grade' stands for 'Brilliant', right? Oh, good. Anyway- Blurred.   IT HAD EVERYTHING.  A deformed freak who picked up hitchikers, playing a recording of a woman having multiple orgasms, in his wagon of death?  Hillbillies eating lasange?  Threesomes in a limo? The driver wearing a cocktail dress?  A stripper-hating nerd who fails to find true love?  Some ugly bitch who picked up an even uglier bitch [male, this time] and attempts sex with him? Several times?  Gothic girls on acid?  One of those great endings where they freeze on the face of each character and the text at the bottom of the screen tells you what happened to them after ""schoolies""?  IT. HAD. EVERYTHING.

" I feel like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz!  Except that instead of a tornado, the State Department has come to disrupt my life.    My background:My mother was an OMS for many years and retired in 2002. I never lived with her overseas but the kids and I did get to visit Addis, Dhahran, Riyadh, Barbados. She was always after me to take the FSWE so I did twice in the early 90's.  I didn't pass either time so I thought it wasn't meant to be. I became the teacher I always dreamed of being.   Well, life changes.  My oldest son was in college and after 9/11, he decided he wanted to make a difference and following grandma's lead, he wanted to join the FS.  He wanted me to take the FSWE with him for moral support.  Guess who passed?  Me.  I went to orals the first time in Nov and only scored a 5.1.  My son and I, along with another son had already signed up to take the FSWE again.  Guess who passed this time?  Me, again.  This time I did orals in July and received a 5.9.  Took forever to get my clearances through but then I made the register.  I was offered the June A-100 class but had the last class of my master's to finish so I declined. They then offered me September.    Did I really want to do this?  That has been the million dollar question! Or in the case of the FS, maybe the hundred dollar question. Do I want to leave my kids, have my husband leave his career, just to try something I may not like?  I have gone forward and taken all the steps but I still have days of doubt.  I have my first grandbaby coming on July 22.  How will I like leaving her?  My other son graduates from college in May, will I be here for it?  Another son is getting married in the spring.  How could I miss that?  No guarantees I will still be in the states.  What if I don't like being gone from everyone?  What if I miss teaching? What if I can't stand working in a visa mill?  Is everyone else in the 121st having these doubts?  I sent in all my paperwork on Friday.  I guess that makes it official. Time to get back to sorting 10 years of accumulated junk. At least my house is getting clean!

" Bored am i on this summer's last sunday as  i attempt to make the best of whats left. So last thursday i got back from the JH Pendleton YLC  ...damn it was boring. despuite the boredom i did learn a thing or two about the American way. As you may know  ive been working on a few songs lately ( each of which is dedicated to a friend) and  ive kind of quit  on the funeral one and am at a roadblock  for Haleigh's. Ive completely changed everything about the one dedicated to Herumi. the lyrics are that of a lovesick ballad and instead of guitar and back up instruments, it is solely piano, but rather simplistic. strangely  i consider it my best love song  ive written and the irony is that the girl to whom i am writing it(Herumi) is not even my GF. i think i shall alter haleigh's as well. i guess the problem is that everything about it is too complicated...that damn solo.   despite my end of summer blues i do feel strangely enthusiastic about the upcoming schoolyear. maybe ill meet a nice, pretty, sweet, academically inclined girl whose innocence accentuates her natural beauty...but also strong..like it would take more than one bullet to stop her. it would also be cool if she knew how to play an instrument or knew carpentry or steel welding. damn..maybe  i should find a girl who works at home depot. Eh screw it, my two loves as of now are school and Rock n Roll..GO ABSTINENCE!  k so ive been saving up for a sniper air rifle. i shall get it soon. i cant wait to kill that damn crow terrorizing my dog. i swear i will shoot that things head clean off it neck.  well now i am off to the 32nd street Naval Exchange to get some new clothes.

My friend doesn't realize that I feel physically sick and shaky when I'm near her.  I just can't explain to her that it's not a phobia like spiders or what ever she truly annoys me and I don't know what to do. ,1,tell happened just case read previous post it went camping friend did not want hate bit alcohol started passing friend started touching etc feel sick time fail face anytime know near confided closest friend not understand all say face fear school dread walking past near her friend doe not realize feel physically sick shaky near her just explain not phobia like spider truly annoys not know do

I just can't do it to my mother to spend even more money that she doesn't really have. So now the feeling of guilt 'if' I were to do it is bigger than my misery.

"Is anyone taking Lamictal?  After trying almost every available antidepressant through the years, my psychiatrist is having me try Lamictal.  (I'm 34, started taking medications when I was 18 -- haven't really taking anything for about five years, with the exception of Zoloft back in January, which had terrible side effects.)   Right now I'm using the starter pack of Lamictal.  I took 25 mg for two weeks, and now I'm taking 50 mg for two weeks (I'm on my 17th day) -- working my way up to 200 mg.  I don't know if I really like this medication.  It gives me headaches and affects my sleep.  I think it also increases my anxiety, but maybe that's in my head?  I suppose the side effects aren't ""terrible"" but I still feel somewhat drugged.  Has anyone else had success with Lamictal?

"This message is especially for newcomers desperately seeking a way out of the depression rut. Please read my words carefully as a lot of thought and devotion went into this:  A year ago, I was stuck in the miserable rut of depression with little or no hope of finding a way out. I was attending mandatory group therapy after an attempted suicide and 72 miserable hours in the nut house. They put me on Remeron which helped a little ... taking some of the edge off the suicidal thoughts, but little else. Weeks of trying to learn cognitive behavior therapy went by and hopes of getting better were dwindling. Then one day, my best friend gave me a book which taught me how to properly apply the CBT. Many of you have tried CBT to no avail. I sincerely believe that you did not do it either properly, hard enough, and / or long enough. When retraining the mind, it's vitally important to diligently apply CBT daily for several weeks. (See my webpage for more info: Antidepressant That Works). Once this becomes a regular habit, I'm confident you will see improvement as I did. I'm positive you can do it too. It was the toughest job I've ever had to do, but it sure was worth it. Whenever a negative situation presents itself now, I just block it out and replace it with a positive thought automatically. It's hard in the beginning, but it's totally do - able. Plus, it gets easier after awhile. Then, once it becomes automatic, you don't even have to think about it.  Properly applied CBT helps tremendously, but it's not a complete cure as you will see in my story. You must also take care of your body because it's what furnishes your brain with the proper nutrients. The two go hand in hand. The brain regulates the endocrine system and the neurotransmitters while the body provides the brain with the proper chemicals to do its job.  Leisure activities help also. I know it's difficult for some of you to have fun, but it's important to get your mind off your problems even if just for a little while. I mention motivation in my story. Sometimes you just have to force yourself to do what's good for you even if you don't want to. Contrary to what many believe, motivation begins with action ... not visa - versa. The sooner you begin to properly apply the techniques I learned and the more effort you put in to them, the sooner you will get better. Hopelessness and doubt will be your enemy, so try to put them aside for a month as you get on the road to wellness.  I have been off antidepressants for almost a year now. I feel great ... plus my concentration and comprehension are back. March 5 marked my one year anniversary without alcohol too.

" Okie dokie, folks...my sister showed me her web log, I thought it looked cool, so I decided to start one.  I don't know how much I'll write on here; I tend to start something for a week or two, then activity falls off.  We'll see how long I can keep this one going.    I'm sure you want to know a little about me.  I currently live in a nice little suburb of Chicago called Schaumburg.  I moved up here a little over two years ago to go to law school at DePaul University, and to be slightly closer (by about 1200 miles) to the love of my life, Kristen.  I have a year left of law school (woohoo!), and then it's off to the real world.  I have a passion for three things in life: Kristen, flying, and good food.  Near-passions include country music (yee-haw), four wheel drive, good movies, and probably a bunch of other stuff that just doesn't seem to come to mind at the moment.  As I write in this, though, y'all ought to be able to figure out what I'm into and what I'm not.  Well, that's about enough for now.  Time to get cleaning (this place looks like a tornado had a wild party and all his friends were invited).  So if any of y'all have any ideas for postings, let me know.  Signing off for now.

"Telling my bestfriend she's long winded without hurting her feelings? My bestfriends and I have been bestfriends for about 2 1/2 years. We met in our college choir and are still in college, just for context. When were at school we basically hang out every night and I love her but when she gets started its like she doesn't know when to stop. I've had to resort to redirecting my attention when she's been going on too long.   She tells me the same, or similar stories a lot and has to give me all types of insignificant details that prolong her talking. Even when I bring to her attention she mentioned something before it usually never stops her from telling me again. It does get kinda awkward when I have to ignore her but it hasn't stopped her from rambling. I just don't want to hurt her feelings because I know she talks to me because I'm one of the few people she feels this open to drain everything into.

" So.... welcome everyone! Yes... after reading many people's online journals, I have decided to start my own online journal.  Today, nothing happened today. I woke up around noon....pretty early for me. I had some ice cream for brunch. My sister needed to go to NOVA to drop off some work to her teacher so i decided to tag along. It was a pretty scary experience; In order to make her 5:00pm deadline, which was thirty minutes away, she sped down the highway like a mad woman. But we made through it.  Afterwards we went to Blockbuster to rent Kill Bill: Volume 2. Normally I despise Blockbuster and I would never support them, but I got coupons in the mail for $0.99. So I finally got the movie and went home....really exciting.  My mom wanted us to clean the house from top to bottom and we promised here that we'd do it. The hours went by and we hadn't gotten to it yet. I pop in the Kill Bill DVD instead. I thought it was pretty good, but i have to admit that some parts were kind of random. My sister was confused the whole time...she usually doesn't get movies like this.  After the movie was done, we realized that it was close to midnight and we hadn't started on any of the shit that we were supposed to. We do a lot of cleaning and finish up around 1:00am.  I apologize for this extremely boring entry but my sister insisted that I start my journal today and nothing interesting or exciting happened.  Oh yeah....I got my senior pictures in the mail today! It actually turned out pretty good. Now I have a dilemma because the slowasses that were taking the pictures took over four hours to do their job and I had to go to work so i left before I can take my outfit pictures. So now i had to reschedule another day so i can finishes the pictures. I don't understand why i have to go out of my way to do have another appointment when those slutty whores at LifeTouch fucked up.  I'm excited because in two days I am flying down to Nashville. I haven't been there since the Christmas holiday and I can't wait to see my family. On that same day, the twelfth of August...it's my birfday!

"Backstabbing fake “Friend” So just as me and my friend were getting closer my boyfriend sent her a dick pic. (Boyfriend thing is settled), but the friend thing not so much. She sent him partially clothed pictures, and she definitely has some sort of feelings for him. This happened a month ago and me and her haven’t talked about it much. She acts like nothing happened and she asks me for favors. I honestly hate her now but I’m pretending to like her to her face. How do I take the next step of ending our friendship a month in already?

"Debunking “stigma” Everybody who questions psychiatry often gets the response “you’re stigmatising people with mental health issues”  What’s more stigmatising? Telling people they have biologically broken brains with insufficient brain chemistry, and bad genes? Psychiatrists/psychotherapist within the biopsycho model of human emotions, only drug, or involuntarily “hopstialise” people  Telling people they can’t overcome their problems with life due to their bad brain which doesn’t operate correctly and the only thing they can do is take a psychiatric drug?  Subjecting people to isolation and distancing themselves from people as “different” due to “mental illness” and subjugating the “norm” from the “mentally ill” subjecting people to drug trials they have ended up in suicide and mass homocide, all for the progress of “psychiatric medicine”  Telling people that they have biological genetic brain diseases like “schizophrenia” and they’ll never really live a normal life.  Yet we’re the stigmatisers? YOU’RE the one who solicitates a lawyer when you have tried a psychiatric drug that almost made you kill yourself now you want to fight psychiatry but you’re okay with kids being chemically lobotomised on Ritalin?  How many more expansions of diagnosis in the dsm? does it have to be to wake you sheeples up that Collectivising human behaviour and giving them a label of “disease” with symtomps does it have to be to tell you that these behaviours aren’t found through cellular pathology, brain scans, blood tests, or some medical diagnostic criteria?  How many more deaths, school shootings, senseless violence, suicide by the administration of drugs? Will it have to be to wake you people up that psychiatry has killed more people throughout the entire history of the world than the Jewish halocaust?  It’s time to wake up and see that the “stigma of mental illness” is just psychiatric propaganda to deflect all the damage and life’s runid by their tortuous domain and authoritarian political reign.  Wearing a badge upon your head saying I’m “bipolar” is self deprecative as you’ve surrended your mental factilites and human experience/emotion for the NIMH who’ve admitted you can’t define “mental illness” and want to use you as some priori for the campaigns to sell treatment therapy and drugs.  Own titles like “I beat depression” I “beat bipolar” not resigning yourself to a pathetic existence of numbing your emotions and dying 20 years younger on psychiatric drugs.",1,debunking stigma everybody question psychiatry get response stigmatising people mental health issue stigmatising telling people biologically broken brain insufficient brain chemistry bad gene psychiatristspsychotherapist biopsycho model human emotion drug involuntarily hopstialise people telling people overcome problem life bad brain doe not operate correctly thing psychiatric drug subjecting people isolation distancing people different mental illness subjugating norm mentally ill subjecting people drug trial ended suicide mass homocide progress psychiatric medicine telling people biological genetic brain disease like schizophrenia really live normal life stigmatisers youre solicitates lawyer tried psychiatric drug kill want fight psychiatry okay kid chemically lobotomised ritalin expansion diagnosis dsm doe wake sheeples collectivising human behaviour giving label disease symtomps doe tell behaviour not cellular pathology brain scan blood test medical diagnostic criterion death school shooting senseless violence suicide administration drug wake people psychiatry killed people entire history world jewish halocaust time wake stigma mental illness just psychiatric propaganda deflect damage life runid tortuous domain authoritarian political reign wearing badge head saying bipolar self deprecative surrended mental factilites human experienceemotion nimh admitted define mental illness want use priori campaign sell treatment therapy drug title like beat depression beat bipolar not resigning pathetic existence numbing emotion dying year younger psychiatric drug

You'd think after 50 years of being married they would have something INTERESTING to say. But no, not MY family. Boring stuff there. Then I test drove the Camaro that I'm trying to buy. Fun shit there. My brothers eyes were so huge when I was peeling out and stuff. I loved every second of it, trust me. Then sunday night until tonight, tuesday, I was in south lyon at my uncles house. Worked my ass off but he bought my hungting license and all my tags so that saved me $75.00 so I guess I cant complain. Came home and talked to shelbz about some people for awhile, nothing better to do. Trying to figure out where Brandon is, I think he's at his moms which sucks cuz I have the next two days off with nothing to do, and Ralph moved/is moving so cant go there.

"Is it me? Hello. This is my first time posting here.     So the other day one of my friends texted me, saying I think she's dumb and that she demands respect (this is a month after I just hung out with her; everything seemed fine). She then accused me of insulting her and the school she goes to. I insisted that she took what I said out of context (for example she said I think her major is easy. I never said this, I said it wasn't math focused. Plus she herself said she is having an easy time). She constantly asks me if I think she is intelligent and I always tell her she's smart in her own way like everyone is. Anyway, I said sorry and have a good holiday but she didn't reciprocate and just told me to watch what I say and not to tell anyone she said this.    This isn't the first time this kind of thing happened. One person I know just hates me (quote:""*** hates you and everything about you. He just does."") and I have no idea why. Sometimes he's cool, other times he ignores me (he has pointed out that I'm light skinned black and he's dark so apparently I'm treated better; eveb if that's true I am not responsible for that). Another person hated me for reasons unbeknownst to me (excluded me from group chats and gatherings, made this known to others) and now I'm told they love me (largely made up with this person but I never knew why they hated me to begin with). I'm extremely confused by all of this.     Now I'm a guy who was known as the smart, quiet kid in school with a lot of knowledge. Occasionally I'll let people know my opinions and they'll get a kick out of it. However, I really made it a point to be polite to people even when I disagreed with them or didn't like them. Most people I know say I'm genuinely kind or polite even to the point of being boring.I go out of my way to refrain from cracking mean jokes or speaking bluntly because I know it'll offend people. I try to balance the thoughts in my head and the words I speak (isn't this normal?). Most people at my current school say I'm very nice and friendly. Am I doing something wrong or are people just being bad/weird to me?   TL;DR: I tend to get people who hate me and I don't know why; most people say I'm a kind and logical person.

I'll never be able to work (successfully) with all those things going on. When I went to see an attorney to appeal my disability decision, he said I should find a job with minimal responsibility. What kind of job is that? Don't you have to be responsible enough to at least come to work (and on time)? Don't you have to be responsible to follow the rules of the job? I can't seem to do either one. Each job I get, I think ""maybe this can be the job I can stay at"" and it never happens. The longest I've ever stayed at a job is 1 year. I just feel like such a loser. Everyone I know always says they'll do whatever kind of job for their kids, or I should be lucky to have a job.

"Am I being a bad friend or is she? Hey, I'm kind of new to Reddit but I kinda need an opinion on a situation and I really hope the person I'm talking about never reads this.   I have this close friend, (let's call her P) and lately, P and I have been having some problems.   P is annoyed because she thinks I don't spend enough time with her. She's in one of my classes so I see her every other day for 2 hours but that isn't enough for her and she wants me dedicate my lunch time to her and spend more time texting her. She gets upset about this to the point where she sends me accusatory/passive aggressive texts during lunch about my location. Now keep in mind, I'm an honors student and I usually have club meetings or classwork to do during lunch periods and I barely see my other friends, who I'm much closer to and don't share many classes with, because of this.   I'd be happy to spend time with her in a group of my friends (who she's also friends with) and spend time everyone but she gets mad or upset when I try to talk to my best friends. Also, I don't really like her personality sometimes. She's kind of vain and she flirts with my friends and she likes a lot of guys for simple reasons (i.e. this one guy who's really friendly waves at her every time he sees her in the halls and she had a crush on him for two months because of that even though he wasn't interested). And she always talks about herself and gets jealous of my friendship with the waving guy she liked, to the point where I've stopped talked to him so she doesn't tell me about her dreams in which I make out with the guy in front of her and make her really jealous.  However, she cut off most of her ties with her former friend group because they talked behind her back about how she only talks about herself and the current guy she has a crush on.  I understand her situation and that she feels like she's losing her only friend but I really don't like being controlled and walked on. I also feel bad about her situation and I don't want her to cry, make me look like a bad person and talk behind my back to my friends/twist the situation (which she has done before) and my friends are either telling me to cut it off with her or that I'm overreacting and a bad friend so I'm posting on here for a second, unbiased opinion.

If’s there’s interest I’ll keep posting new episodes as I create them as well as updates (I'll most likely switch media hosts in the future).   Please leave feedback, and share with anyone and everyone who you’d think benefit from hearing it. I was inspired by podcasts such as Death Sex and Money, Dear Sugars, and mainly, This Is Actually Happening. Thanks for listening.

" And so begins the life of my blog, a true understanding of what it is to be bloggish. Okay, so maybe I made that word up. I thought I would begin my disadvantageous interest in blogging for the first time. I have read many and participated in none. Creating this posting off of pure allurement of the idea has been quite interesting and (hopefully) stays that way. Today I create, and juxtapose the ideas of life and wonderment of a being, which whom, has a slightly higher interest in being more than most.

I've been sitting here all morning reading through everyone's posts and have been think that I have no right to hate my life. I have a good family, friends and have had experiences other 20yr olds would only dream of. But there is something in my head telling me that my life sucks and nobody cares if I am here or not. Then the real me kicks back in and I think I am stupid for thinking that. STUPID. Stupid for thinking I have no purpose. So that makes me feel even worse. I fear. I don't know. Being alone and rejected I guess. I don't do I often but when I am having a 'fat week' I have purged and over exercised. I don't know if this is because I really think I am fat or. I don't know why else, but I am not overweight. I have never told any one any of this in person. I can't do it. I hate sympathy. When I am around my friends I am totally the opposite. I am so hyper and half the time it is not even an act sometimes I just can't control. Other times I do have to put it on just so that don't ask me if anything's up but I have never failed to fool them.

"Well, I guess, i mean i know I need help. I lost my husband . he died of a heart attack at 56 on his walk home from a police station from being arrested for soliciting a prostitute., two years ago, can't get over it. It was a bad scene, we were not great lovers or anything like that, more like companions, he cheated on me a lot and i just accepted it, but we did things together, ate out a lot, went to flea markets, he was nice to me, he loved me , he was just stupid, and i wouldn't have sex with him because of his indiscretion, I think he understood that.  After he died, about 6 months or so, I started going to a psychiatrist. He put me on lots of medications, it cost a lot of money, I was still depressed somewhat and really, I don't think he understood me at all. So about 6 months ago, I quit, everything, medications, therapy, etc.  I have a 30 year old son that lives with me and causes me a lot of grief, he has diabetes really bad and no job. Two days ago he was lethargic and his blood sugar was 500, I had to take him to the ER and I know it's going to cost me thousands of dollars. I have no extra money, but what does a person do.

" Hi, I'm Gabe's mom, Chrissi. Gabe [aka, Gabriel, bird, goo, goober] is my six month old son. He is a gorgeous little boy, he likes to eat, play, pull the cats' ears, coo, laugh, and nap with his daddy. Gabe also has spina bifida and hydrocephelus (sp?). It was quite a shock to learn that he had spina bifida. We went in for our 20 week check-up and everything was very normal. We found out he was a little boy and that he was growing well. At 28 weeks, i developed diabetes, that sucked, so we asked the doctor to do another ultrasound to make sure gabe wasn't getting too big, that was when we found out that his spine hadn't closed all of the way and that the ventricles in his brain were a little bit larger than they should be. Talk about overwhelmed, disoriented, and generally confused, we had no clue what the hell spina bifida was, let alone how we were going to deal with it! At 37 weeks, Gabriel was delivered by a wonderful team of doctors and rushed to the NICU to be prepped for surgery. For almost 2 weeks we couldn't hold him, nor could I breast feed, snuggle, or be very close to him. I think that the worst part was going home without him. He stayed in the hospital for 16 days. He had a shunt placed in his head when he was 14 days old. My husband was freaking out over the shunt, after all, they had to put it in his brain! Everything worked out fine, and he came home with us and we have been living pretty happily ever after. Ok, not quite, reality has a funny way of making the whole, ""oh look we have a cute little baby in the house, isn't this fun??"" be a little more like, ""holy shit, i never sleep, i've worn the same clothes for 3 days, and i smell!!!"" on top of this, we are dealing with a child who has to see special doctors, an hour away, i might add, and we are continually worrying about something going wrong.  The special doctors are still a reality, but we don't see them very often now, only about once every 3 weeks. Now at 6 months, gabe is a pretty normal baby. i am back to work at the Montessori school I teach at, and gabe comes with me. He loves all of my kids and they love him back. We are blessed that Gabe has a ""low level"" case of spina bifida, which means, he has bladder and bowel control, he will walk, and most people won't even realize has a birth defect!

"I just need to get this off of my chest. This is my first time posting. I’m not sure if trigger warnings are common place here, but before you read on I would like to say warn that this mentions suicide.  A family member took their life last week and I’m really, really struggling.  I’m absolutely devastated that my children won’t be able to grow up with them around.   I’m struggling to keep it all together.  I just want to cry all day. But I don’t want my kids to see my crying.  Everyone around me is just carrying on like normal.  I have a history of depression, I’m currently in therapy and on medication. I feel like my family is wrapping me in cotton wool.  When I first found out how it happened, I obsessed over articles that described the process they would have went through while dying. I kept wondering what they were feeling in that moment... if during those last moments they had regret. Then I kept tormenting myself with the “what if?”  I’ve been able to stop doing those. But now... I just want to be a sloth. I want to sit on the couch and watch TV all day. All motivation I had prior to last week has just gone.   I’ve never had anyone this close to me die. A friend who I had grown apart from committed suicide last year. I was upset,.. but I wasn’t this upset.  Let me stress this - I am definitely not having any suicidal thoughts.   Due to the unexpected costs we’ve had, I can’t afford to see the psychologist, that’s why I’m posting here.

The fear aspect seems to get worse at night, im not afraid of one specific thing it just turns into an overall consuming dread. I want to cry like 80% of nights but I simply can’t. I also want to sleep more than anything in the world, it’s my favourite thing.

"Am I crazy for wanting to get back with her? So let me give you guys a bit of a timeline first:   - April 2017 we met at work, became really good friends. She still had a boyfriend, but broke up with him about 2 weeks after we started hanging out.   - June 2017 I told her I liked her as more than a friend, she didn't feel this way towards me at the time.   - July 2017 she started dating a guy she already knew, we'll call him Jake.   - August 2017 she broke up with Jake. Jake made her feel terrible for it and cut her off completely, leaving her to say that she hated him and wanted no part of him.  - September/October 2017 she told me she's always been attracted to me, but wasn't ready for a relationship. I was in love with her at this time, after knowing her for a while and her being everything I want in someone. Suggested being FWB, which I took her up on. But whenever I tried to make a move on it, she didn't seem to want to do anything. We hung out just us 2 every day, would always be talking, but for some reason when the time came around to make a move she never seemed to want to do anything.   Mid October 2017 she said how we would be better off being friends since we didn't seem to be going anywhere and that it was hurting her self esteem, and that she started talking to Jake again. She is currently still dating Jake, but from what I hear from her are on the verge of another breakup.  And now I want her more than ever. I was absolutely heartbroken when she cut things off with me, and I'm still not over her. And she knows this. If she cuts things off with Jake, I don't know what to do. I want her back more than anything, but at the same time it's like she put me through such pain and I don't want to chance that happening again. She is everything that I could possibly want in a girl, and I can't imagine myself without her. And we're still friends, which probably isn't helping to be honest. But she's still my best friend.

"Hi all... this is going to be a long post, but I'd really like some feedback on it... I'm kind of young, 17. I'm currently involved in a relationship (long distance) with a boy who's a year older than me, and I love him more than words can say. The thing is, though, I'm a very depressed person sometimes.  I don't know if I'm making this up or if I actually read this somewhere, but I'm what I've heard classified as a ""seasonally"" depressed person: I experience depression more during the winter months (December through February) than I do any other time of the year. I have a lot of family problems that compound to my depression as well. When I was 13, I moved halfway across the country and I never accepted living here. I'm a city-girl, but I moved to the country. I feel isolated and alone out here, and I don't have anyone to talk to. My mother told me to ""buck up"" and ""get over it"" when I went to her about my depression a couple of years ago. She's currently on medication for her own depression. My father has a crippled arm (which he gained when we moved here) and has some addiction problems, so I don't go to him.  I have a very hard time trusting people. My mother and father were both abused as children, and my mother verbally abuses me. Recently, starting in about December, I started wanting to hurt myself physically again. The urge faded, but the depression lingered. For a while I've been emulating my mother on my boyfriend--I keep taking out my own anger and my own depression on him. I'm afraid that if I keep up with this behavior, I'm going to lose my boyfriend to my own selfishness. A lot of the time I wish I could disappear. I don't like being seen by people and I like to be alone, but at the same time I feel isolated in my soul. I tried religion, but I can't bring myself to place my faith in something I can't see. I'm really afraid that my depression is going to cause me to lose the one thing I even care about at all anymore in the world. I don't know what to do. My parents won't help me, my teachers don't know how to deal with it, and I've been to depression forums like this before and they really helped. I guess all I'm looking for is someone to lean on while I get through the winter months. If anyone has any suggestions for a homebody (my parents don't allow me to leave the house after school is over), please let me know. Also keep in mind that I can't call people very easily with eavesdropping people in my house. Thanks.

"I hate my mum I dislike my mum. In fact, I’m disgusted with her and feel rage sometimes. She acts fake towards me, meanwhile behind my back, she complains and gossips about me. She hates when I talk to my dad at all because she thinks we’re rivalling against her which isn’t true. When I confront her with things she’s said, she says, ‘I never said that. Stop pinning me down. You’re lying. I never lie. I’m perfect.’ And she is religious. This one year I asked if I could see a therapist and she refused until I told her my reasons which she was the reason mainly. Then I told her something else and then she would deliberately ignore me and get mad every time I’d ask again. Until like, 1 year went by and she said I have to have a therapist who is the same religion which I’m not even. She went psycho this one year and yelled, slapped my older sister, threw plates at all of us until we’d run outside to our backyard. And I’ve tried being honest with her. I told her I had some serious trouble at school with bullying and she knew who it was and said to me, ‘they’re always nice to me. I don’t believe you.’ And she never talks with me about how I’m doing or even made dinner when I was younger so I’m still underweight. And she gets mad at every honest thing I say because I’m just kinda frank. My oldest sister has rebelled against her and stuff but yet, she still is a heartless person. And when I’m away from ‘home’ she won’t ever text or call me and then when I return ‘home’ she’ll yell at me and accuse and manipulate me. She’ll say, ‘is it really that hard to send a text?!’ Meanwhile she never does. And she manipulated my dad and ever since I was 7, she’s wanted to divorce my dad and it’s sad because my family is so split, all my dad wants is to just have dinner as a family but that’s too hard. And my ‘mum’ blames my dad for the split of the family.

"I (28) did a DNA test on 23andme it told me I had a cousin I didn't know about. My BF and I decided to do DNA tests because they were on sale for black friday. We got our results back last week.

Her bio mom says they she isn't ready to be in contact with her.

I think it was a very traumatic experience for her and she may not want to bring up those memories.   I feel stuck in the middle now and don't know how to deal with the situation. I suffer from social anxiety and this whole situation has caused me panic attacks. I feel bad for my newly found cousin and don't want to break her heart but I can't go around my aunts wishes.   I don't have a lot of information about the family that I could pass on without talking to my aunt or other family members. I am the youngest cousin and my grandparents passed away when I was quite young. I'm not super close with my extended family but that's mostly due to my social anxiety , I care a lot about them and don't want to hurt any of them.   Help please!

"I have a close friend who is problematic, but not towards me A couple of years ago, I had a falling out with one of my friends and during this time, I fell back on this girl in my class, who I will call Blue. We got close in only a few months, and eventually, this will be the only time we will ever be in the same class. It was just the two of us. I'm in one of her classes now and my friends still associate me as her best or one of her closest friends. It's not a particularly good association (doesn't reflect on me though, just her).  A lot of people don't like her, especially the people I'm friends with now. I haven't been around for a while (I moved down to Brighton for a bit of time) and I haven't seen her either, but I know that she doesn't have a lot of friends. I've been hearing stories and past anecdotes about her that really troubled me, so I'd like to have some advice.  This one girl (who would never lie about something like this because she's so sweet, probably still hasn't gone through puberty) said that Blue once pit her up against the teachers and made her cry because she was so stressed and she didn't understand the situation. Blue has a kind of controlling personality and will not be open-minded to other people's ideas and input. An idea of close friend of my close friend, Yellow, was swept by as Blue simply dismissed it, and just wrote what she wanted to do in a group project. Yellow is also quiet, VERY passive and formerly a good friend of Blue and to some point, even I, so when I heard this happening to Yellow, I was really shocked that Blue could even do something like that.  She will also guilt-trip you and self-deprecate herself. She will tell you that everyone hates her and that she's really bad at a subject she does really well in. It's annoying, and sometimes I even hear it, but to others she does it in this really soft, guilt-tripping voice. It's a problem because often, she's the problem and then she guilt-trips to turn it to look like she's saying that the people calling her out are just trying to make her feel bad.   But Blue has never done any of this to me. When I'm around her, we talk about our futures and Star Wars. She jokes and memes a lot, but because we're not as close anymore, they aren't as funny. I avoid confrontation too so I almost never rebutt her points. Recently, she apologized to me about how poor her behaviour was back then, but I didn't understand what she was talking about. Now, I get it. But her behaviour wasn't just 'back then' either, it was also just a couple (maybe about two) years ago. Maybe even now, but everyone has probably already distanced themselves from her.  She also has this fake 'caring' voice that she uses around the people in her music group. She never uses this voice around me, but the music people all generally speak like that. The thing is, the 'caring' side to her is just like a mask, and the people who know her know that she's not usually like that. She has hurt their friends who don't deserve to be hurt, and for no apparent reason either.  I know that most of my friends feel uncomfortable bringing her up around me because it'll be something negative (I've never heard anyone who really knows her say something positive about her), but because of that I've been sheltered to how she treats her classmates. Another girl (Red) once said that while she was consoling a friend who didn't like to be touched, Blue came in, wrapped her arms around the sobbing girl and 'glared' at Red like one of those mean girls. Never have I ever heard something so cliched and dramatised, but unfortunately, I could definitely picture it.  When I'm around her, I definitely don't feel like her personality is weighing down on me, but I'm conscious of the connotations surrounding her. All the girls mentioned are also my friendly mutuals, so they don't associate me with her, as I'm generally polite, quiet and will crack a joke around them. I also know that Blue doesn't like people so when we were walking from our class, I'm worried that we'll bump into someone that doesn't like her or whom she doesn't like. So yes, I am very bothered about how people view her, mostly because there actually is something to dislike.  What should I do? Slowly back out of this friendship? Should I slowly doorslam her until the end of the year when our class is over? Should I just continue being her friend despite her bad behaviours?   Two things: the stories are most definitely true, and I don't want Blue to know that I know about her being a bad classmate. I overheard these stories from reliable people.  Sorry for the long post.

"I dropped an internet friend several months ago and I regret it. I met her like almost 3 years ago. We were very close internet friends and would talk basically every day. She was amazing. In real life i had basically no friends. She was the only friend I had. I'm sure this led me to having unhealthy views on relationships. I still have unhealthy habits and feelings towards relationships. Anyways, the trouble began when on instagram, our main chatting platform, she began to gain friends from just common interests and such. She started posting screenshots of her friends and her dm conversations and how funny they were. She then would post screenshots of her group chat conversations and how funny they were. All of this would happen, and I would still be waiting for a simple reply. I didn't get it. I still don't really get it. I was there for her for so long. She didn't have many friends in real life or online either. But once she had gotten these new internet friends she would ignore me? She would reply up to three or four days later. She also made a whole separate account where she would post as well which she never even told me about and I had to find out myself when she spoke about it on her main account. I finally had enough and sent her a long explanation about my feelings and stuff and didn't speak to her after that. And the funny thing is that she didn't reply to my explanation for two weeks. And suddenly she was like "":( nooo pls :(("" etc Typing all of this, I lowkey am getting annoyed.. I just want someone to smack some sense into me. Like it's been so long and I still think about her. It wasn't like she was a bad friend, but she just fuckin ignored me and basically left me.  I usually think about her when I'm feeling lonely or my irl best friend starts to treat me like shit and ignores me.. but that's a different story... Right now, I'm thinking about dming her and just having small talk. I feel like it's a bad idea, but also it could reunite us and we could be friends again?  It's probably a bad idea and I probably won't do it though..

"Whatever happened to Doctor - patient confidentiality???  I applied for short term disability because depression is affecting my job and I am barely function - able at work. The insurance company made me sign a waiver of privacy to both my therapist and psychiatrist.  Now they can call them up and ask anything they want!!  The insurance company called me yesterday for a telephone ""interview""! They wanted me to explain why I needed the time off, what my symptoms are, how long have I been like this, really personal questions .......  They are going to be the ones who determine whether I can get disability pay or not! Whatever happened to just taking the word of the doctor??  I wonder who the insurance company can tell? I forgot to ask them if this is going to be kept confidential.  They also asked how this is affecting my job, I felt if I gave the ""wrong"" answer, they will decide not to pay me.  I wonder what they are going to ask my shrinks, and how much info the shrinks can give them.  Also, I understand that the shrinks / therapists can break the confidentiality rule if you threaten to hurt yourself or another --- that I can understand, but if you are ever on trial for something they can subpoena the doctors and they have to tell ALL!  That is ridiculous!  What happens if I am just a witness to some crime, but did not do the crime.  What happens if the lawyers want to discredit me so they put my shrink on the stand to ask what a nut I am?  Just ranting, but opinions, feedback would be appreciated.

"My mother died...Left me more the siblings My mother died recently. She had a retirement account and life insurance. I have two siblings. The benefits are being paid and She left me much more then them. I received about 50-60% of her money. I feel guilty and I'm afraid my siblings will forever have animosity towards me and my mother. Both siblings left long ago. One out of state and one out of the country. I was the only one around for my mom for more then 15yrs. She got cancer three years ago along with other illnesses and suffered a great deal. I was the only one here to help. Her last year and a half was very tough and I was her full time caregiver. I gave up a everything. As a business owner I Lost most my clients, compiled a mountain of debt and now I am alone to care for her house ( I gave up my place) and pay the mortgage. One sibling says it's unfair that I got more then twice him. The conversation killed me because I think he is hurt by it and I feel guilty. My mom told them before she died that I got the lions share but he says he didn't think it was this much of a disparity. I don't know what to do or how I should feel. She always told me she had her reasons. Part of me thinks that fair isn't always equal and I want to tell him that. At the same time I don't want to feel entitled or like I deserve something more. I don't know what to do if anything. I don't feel like I should give them some of my inheritance.   I guess I am looking for a little validation and a little advise.   side note: I don't think insurance companies and retirement funds should reveal the total policy or amounts and beneficiaries payout percentage.

"Best guy friend is ignoring me, and I don't understand why My best guy friend ""Jake"" (not his real name) have known each other for 14 years. We are now both 19 years old. Of all the friends I currently have, I've been friends with Jake the longest. We first met in kindergarten. I used to be really chubby and shy when I was much younger, so I got picked on a lot. Jake was my only friend back when I was in elementary school and middle school, and he stood up for me a lot back then. In high school, I started to grow out of my childhood awkwardness, lost a significant amount of weight, and managed to find a small group of friends in my school's anime club. Throughout all this, Jake was a very steady, loyal, and supportive friend, and I'm forever grateful to him for that. We ended up getting into different colleges, both around an hour away from our hometown. Even though things got somewhat busy at times, we kept in regular contact and found time to hang out when we were both in our hometown at the same time. Recently, I met a great guy ""Aaron"" (not his real name) in college. We started dating. I wanted him to meet my friends from back home, so I arranged a time to meet for dinner. During our meetup (I invited 3 friends from high school, including Jake), I noticed that Jake was unusually quiet. He didn't say much of anything during our dinner. I thought it was a bit weird because he is normally really talkative (I'm usually the quieter one in our friendship), so I pulled him aside and asked him what's wrong. He said nothing, so I figured nothing was wrong.   That meetup was two months ago. About two weeks ago, I reached out to Jake on Facebook to ask him how things are going and to try to catch up on life. He completely ignores all my messages. I tried texting him to ask if he's mad at me. No response. I don't understand. I feel completely blindsided by this because Jake has never gone more than one day without responding to my messages. A mutual friend told me that she always suspected that Jake liked me, but I highly doubt that. He never showed any signs of liking me back when we were in high school, and he had a couple of girlfriends in high school. He's not the shy type, so I highly doubt he would be the type of guy to hide his feelings for so many years.

"I'm 15 and have been depressed for about a year. i got over it for a little while but now i am back to all the pain. I cut myself for the first time a couple weeks ago and now i can't stop. I always reach for my knife when I'm alone and hurting.  One of my major problems is that I'm really good at hiding my feelings. No one knows that I'm depressed and no one except my best friend knew that i cut myself. I told my best friend because we tell each other everything when I told her the only thing she could say was ""you're Crazy"" Not exactly the reaction i was expecting especially since she once told me that she cut herself because we got into a huge fight. And even though I knew she was only saying it for attention and she had no scars on her wrist the next day, i still supported her. But now she is turning her back on me. I think she thinks I'm doing it for attention but I'm not. if i were i wouldn't hide the scars under my wrist band and long sleeve shirts. Any way so now i have no one there to talk to. I don't trust anyone anymore and I'm too scared to tell my parents. Even if i did they can't do anything. I have 3 other brothers and my parents don't have the time or money to deal with my problems.  I really scare myself. I have already planned out how I'm going to kill myself if i do and i tempt myself all the time i never have the guts to go through with it all the way but I still try.

"Help...Relationship with my depressed, mentally messed up friend This is my first time posting on reddit, sorry if I have made any mistakes.  This post is gonna be quite long. To start with, my friend and I are both 15 year olds living in Hong Kong and we study in the same school. She is a great person, very special, someone I can never forget. The problem is that she is the kind of person who smiles in front of people but is actually depressed. And I feel like I will just make things worse.  Because of her laughs and near-crazy actions, nobody knows her true feelings. In fact she constantly complains about everything, being unpopular, being immature, the education system here, her online friends, just to mention a few. She is tired and feels like a loser all the time. Games and cosplaying is the only way she escapes from reality. I don't mind listening to rants. It's ok to be sad. But I seriously do not know how to respond when she comes up with questions related to suicide.  During lessons my friend would show me long paragraphs about her self hate and ask for my reply. A typical example of our conversation: ""Why am I so unpopular?"" ""..."" ""WHY AM I SO UNPOPULAR."" ""...maybe you have different hobbies and interests from most people?"" Then she starts to regret her choices, why did she choose to study in this school, if she had been in another school, she would have been happier... etc.  In her letters, she questioned about the meaning of life. She wrote about ""nightmares"", ""thought crimes"" and ""leaving the endless circle of life"". That left me terrified. All I could do is to sit next to her speechless. If I said something wrong she would just jump off from the roof. Not to mention all those confusing philosophical questions. I can never give an answer simply because I don't know how. I once asked the school social workers how to talk to a depressed friend. Her advice was literally trash, and I ended up crying when I talked about her suicidal thoughts. I have no idea what to do. The next day when you see her at the school gates, she puts on that smile again, but she definitely has problems.  Anyone has experience in dealing with such friends? Depressed friends who smiles all the time? It sounds weird to ask what I can do for you, because she normally won't respond (at least I think so).

I'm a 24 year old male and I've had problems with depression for as long as I can remember, though it's become worse over the last year or so. I was pretty heavily involved in music and martial arts for years, but I'm no longer motivated to do either. I'm still going to school, though I have no real direction and I'm afraid that my lack of motivation is going to cause me to screw that up too.  I started having anxiety attacks about a year ago and they've increased in frequency the last few months. They're (not to sound melodramatic) the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with. If I'm in panic-attack mode, any slight pain or discomfort quickly becomes a life-threatening illness that is surely going to kill me in the next few minutes. As ridiculous as that sounds, it's absolutely real when it's happening and I live in almost constant fear it's going to happen again. I have a hard time even driving anymore (especially on the freeway) and increasingly rely on my girlfriend for menial things like going to the store. She is very supportive and is aware that something is wrong, though I don't think she understands to what extent. I've started completely avoiding any situation in which I have to meet new people and have a hard time even talking to people I don't know on the phone. These symptoms have been increasing in intensity over the last 6 months or so and exponentially for the last 3 weeks (I just lost my job). It seems like quite a few of you have been dealing with these sorts of things for much longer and I'm sorry if my posting here so soon seems insensitive, but its already getting to the point where I know I can't handle living like this for years on end. I've suffered from depression for (relative to my age) a long time and the anxiety attacks are absolutely terrifying (a little redundant, I know). It feels like the last year is the beginning of everything completely falling apart. I guess my posting here is a way to get the ball rolling towards getting some help. I don't have health insurance anymore and I'm not sure where to go from here. I've been medicated in the past, but I haven't taken anything in a few years.

"I don’t want to lose friendship of 10 years but I think it’s going that way Hi guys,  I don’t usually do this but I literally feel like I have nowhere else to vent.  Ok. I have been friends with this person for 10 years since we were teenagers. We both clicked over time through going to the same school and I really liked her personality. We ended up going to college in the same city so during that time we sometimes hung out and I let her stay over at my place a few times when she needed to. After graduation she’s spent some time living in other countries teaching and we have kept in contact but not as much, though we have met up when she’s been back.  So the last time I saw her in person was when she was on a break from teaching 3 months ago. Since then we have occasionally talked but it’s been me sending messages more than her. The last time we Skyped was 2 months ago and last time we had a proper conversation was a month and a half ago when I asked her for some advice about a trip I was going on. I then stopped messaging her for a few weeks as I didn’t want to bother her if she was busy. Started messaging again but just sending a few pictures of my trip and seeing if she wanted to talk. She saw my messages but didn’t reply. So I left it another week - I sent her a few messages today but again she was online and reading them and no reply. I have tried not to bother her if she’s busy and have stressed to her that I don’t want to bother her but she has just gone silent on me since late January and it’s basically been me trying to initiate conversation with her and her not responding.  The thing is I am racking my brain and trying to think what I could have done to upset her - if anything, and I can’t think of anything. I have questioned whether I’m getting ahead of myself but then not having her around makes me miss her and feel hurt that she’s suddenly decided to stop talking to me for whatever reason. The thing is I have been considering what loss it would be for me to not be friends with her anymore - It wouldn’t be easy for me as she is one of the only few people I still speak to from my school days and we could relate so much to each other.   But if for some mysterious reason she’s cut me off and no longer wants to be friends then what can I do? I basically sent her a message saying I wouldn’t try contacting her again voluntarily and left it at that. I feel like I may never hear from her again and it really hurts. But what can I do? If something isn’t there anymore then it’s just not there.  - A 20 something year old female who is tired of petty childish bullshit",0,not want lose friendship year think going way hi guy not usually literally feel like vent ok friend person year teenager clicked time going school really liked personality ended going college city time hung let stay place time needed to graduation spent time living country teaching kept contact not much met back time saw person break teaching month ago occasionally talked sending message her time skyped month ago time proper conversation month half ago asked advice trip going on stopped messaging week did not want bother busy started messaging just sending picture trip seeing wanted talk saw message did not reply left week sent message today online reading reply tried not bother busy stressed not want bother just gone silent late january basically trying initiate conversation not responding thing racking brain trying think upset anything think anything questioned getting ahead not having make miss feel hurt suddenly decided stop talking reason thing considering loss not friend anymore not easy people speak school day relate other mysterious reason cut longer want friend do basically sent message saying not try contacting voluntarily left that feel like hear really hurt do not anymore just not there year old female tired petty childish bullshit

She calls me lazy and ungrateful, complains about how I don’t do anything productive and sit around all day, I don’t eat much if anything. She treats me so awfully and if I retaliate in the same way all of a sudden I’m the bad person.

" I cant figure out why some people only give out their opinions only to destroy someone else. What is wrong with people today? I'm sick and tired of hearing views and beliefs on politics, religion, and other stuff. I'm sick of seeing the way people behave when it comes to opposing views. Why can't we just...I don't know...Sit and enjoy the fresh air on a spring day? Sounds corny I know, but isn't that better than bashing a man for what he thinks is right or wrong. What did Jesus do? He ate with people that were wrong and people who reveled in their own beliefs.  He loved them, he didn't care! I'm so sick of us so called Christians seeking out only people who disagree with us only to prove that we are right! What worth is that? Will the glory of the coming Lord be enough for them and us? I guess not because all we care about is making sure that we are right and that they are wrong. Why can't we enjoy life, loving people, enjoying that we are different and loving them to Christ, not proving it to them. Life is so short. How can we make it count if we don't live by example and live with him? When I go out in the world I will try hard not to condemn people but love them, and in the meantime...Sit and enjoy the day, instead of sinking in my own so-called ""righteousness"". God did not create man to argue...But to love, and prosper with him. And...By the way...If you are going to talk with people who don't agree with you, remember this, ""the greatest single cause of atheism in the world today...Is Christians...Who acknowledge him with their lips and walk out the door and lead on with their lifestyle.

"It's been a while since I've written and I decided to start off again with a bit of a bang. I'm going to post my story of beginning recovery, this is to try and cheer some people up and to let them know that they could do it too. Well now, where to start.... About a year and a half ago (the beginning of Grade 8) is when I started to notice the changes. Not physical but emotional. I had been told many times that this was very normal for teenagers so I thought nothing of it. There was an incident with a rather immature and nasty young man, who I just happened to have an ENORMOUS crush on. Anyway we both kind of lead each other on for a while but nothing happened, than he meet this girl at a hockey game. He immediately started talking about her all the time and how he really loved her so much.  I began to feel more and more useless. After that I started rolling down hill like a circle of cheese, and by March of that year I was quite close to suicide at several occasions. This is when I started noticing that this might not be normal and tried many self-help methods, all of which failed. I thought Grade 9 could be a new beginning, it wasn't. My grades were starting to slip and I just couldn't be happy anymore. Finally after a close call in December I told my mum all about my failed attempts and how I was feeling. She agreed to get me a new doctor. I visited her and I got diagnosed with depression and was prescribed Cipralex. Of course that took a while to work too which involved me missing a lot of school, falling really far behind, and having several more close calls. Finally I started feeling a little better and was even stable enough to start going back to school and going to visit my family in the East. Well I just got back from that trip and I have never felt better. I am ready to face the world. That trip was just what I needed. When I get through these next weeks until my birthday all I can see is a varely clear path ahead! For the first time in a year and a half I can concentrate and tolerate less than perfect circumstances. I hope everyone here will feel this way, you can if you just push through! Power to us! Rock on!",1,written decided start bit bang going post story beginning recovery try cheer people let know too now start year half ago the beginning grade started notice change not physical emotional told time normal teenager thought it incident immature nasty young man just happened enormous crush on kind lead happened meet girl hockey game immediately started talking time really loved much began feel useless started rolling hill like circle cheese march year quite close suicide occasion started noticing not normal tried selfhelp method failed thought grade new beginning not grade starting slip just not happy anymore finally close december told mum failed attempt feeling agreed new doctor visited got diagnosed depression prescribed cipralex course took work involved missing lot school falling really far behind having close call finally started feeling little better stable start going school going visit family east just got trip felt better ready face world trip just needed week birthday varely clear path ahead time year half concentrate tolerate perfect circumstance hope feel way just push through power u rock on

"42 year old male newbie, just discovering that I suffer from depression. While there has been evidence all throughout my life, and while I have family members that have suffered from depression (grandmother committed suicide), I for some reason am just figuring out now that I suffer from the disease. My questions for those much more experienced and knowledgeable on the forum. 1. How would you go about your initial steps of diagnosis and treatment? I currently do not have med insurance, so cost is certainly an issue (we should have medical insurance in place in about a month, as part of my wife's new employer package). 2. I take a healthy dose of vitamins daily, including proteins such as L-Tyrosine, which helps me feel really good when I'm not under the effects of depression. Does anyone on the forum have experience with L-Tyrosine and its impact on their feelings of depression? I understand that the amino acids help with the production of dopamine and helps with brain function. Any comments? A little background: I am just coming off a very successful 4 year period where I started a complicated new business and got married again. However, during these last few months I have been unable to work at my previous pace, putting my business in real jeopardy. In fact, there are only a couple of days per week where I seem to be able to work, and typically only a few hours at a time during those days. When I do work I get exhausted quickly. Today, I had a major conference call that required some preparation. I was very up during the call, but then collapsed afterward in complete exhaustion. Seems to be the story for me recently, I can psych myself up for short bursts of performance, then I quickly decline again in an inability to concentrate on anything other than light web surfing. I continue to get up early and exercise daily. I live a healthy lifestyle, eat well, and walk 5+ miles every morning. I sleep regular hours, however, will sleep a few hours during the day during my 'down' days.  Looking back at my past, I am now clearly seeing times in my life where my performance level went down drastically, or where I had problems with relationships. At the time, I didn't realize anything was going on, or I simply didn't understand it. I can now go recall having real problems with my grades during my freshman year of high school. At the time, I recall saying to myself that I couldn't understand why I was performing so badly. It was as it something was holding me back and I could not overcome it. At the time, I just kept studying and working harder, but I was unsuccessful. Eventually, I got through it and my grades went back to normal. But all of these years I never really understood what happened in that freshman year, until now. In summary, there have been many other times in my life where things have fallen apart and I have not understood why. My past is littered by successful businesses that I have created and then have eventually failed, usually by my inability to maintain my performance level. There has obviously been a pattern that I do not yet understand, but at least now I am beginning to see why there was a downturn. Thankfully, I have now met the women of every man's dreams. While she knows I am depressed I have not yet let her know the depths of my despair or of my recent understanding of my past behavior. The good news here is that I have great family support, but I am wrestling with how much to tell my wife about what is going on inside my head. She gets stressed easily and will worry deeply about me. I'm not sure I want to lay that all out on her. Anyone else find themselves in this dilemma?

He then proceded to say that he’s had complaints about mopeds in the area(a motoscooter is classified as a moped here) and he also wanted to warn me about a new law passed a few days ago requiring all moped drivers to carry an ID with Name, Address, and Birthdate.  I said ok and sped off on my merry way.  I wouldn’t have had so much trouble with him if he hadn’t blared his siren at me.  Anyways, on Saturday, I went to Tyson’s Corner Mall(The local really expensive mall) for about half a day.  I went up and was going to go to a few classes at the Apple Store.  I attended half of one and the others never happened.  No real big deal for me, but I really wanted to attend those, and now I will never have the chance *sniff*.  Ah well, such is life.

"Hi everyone. I am a 26 yrold mom of three, 6 and under. My depression started as a teenager, but somehow back then I was able to ""talk myself out of it"" and perhaps had enough going on to keep me distracted. I got married right after high school, and nine months later, (overnight, really) became a mom. I never intended to be a mom at nineteen. I had dreamed of going to college, enjoying years of freedom with my husband, and then, carefully ""planning"" our first child. Well, seven years later, we've planned only one (our last), and strangely enough my only planned child was the hardest to recover from emotionally. After the birth of my first child I struggled with denial over all my crushed dreams, and fought back depression and suicide on a daily basis. I saw a psychiatrist who put me on various medicines over the next few months, to no significant improvement. When my daughter was three months old I was voluntarily committed to a behavioral health facility and stayed there four days. I came out fully charged, and within a matter of days, was right back where I started. So I started seeing a therapist who did me little good, and continued on the latest medicine combination I was prescribed. Shortly after my daughter turned one I finally gave up on the medicines and the therapy and pretended to be better, even though I wasn't, because of the sheer frustration that nothing was ""helping"" so I might as well just get on with life. I continued to battle depression and suicide on a daily basis, and also struggled with behavior that was contrary to what a good mother should be. My husband was military, and it is during times in his absence that I have become ""her"", my alter ego, someone who is intolerant, impatient, selfish, and ugly towards my kids. And blah, blah, blah. Do you guys get tired of telling your life story, because I do. I've lost count of how many times I've told it to various therapists in some vain attempt to help them understand me. So let me tell you where I am now. I am a person who is deeply confused. On the one hand I dearly love my kids, my husband, and I have the desire to live life and see my children grow and strengthen my relationship with them and my husband. On the other hand, I am sapped of every last ounce of purpose, life becomes extremely monotonous, and I strain to see the point of it all. Even now, as I write this, I am wondering, ""why am I wasting my time? These people will never know one tenth of a percent of what is going on inside me."" And that is how I've left every therapy session I've ever gone to, feeling like my time was utterly wasted and like I've made a chicken scratch in an issue solid as ice and twenty feet deep. I balance on a fragile thread of life and death and I'm scared that it is only a matter of time before something tips the balance just far enough that I finally do ""it"". My biggest fear is that by the time I find a way to heal myself, if I make it that far, my kids will have paid the ultimate price and be a product of confusion and sadness too. I am sick and tired of trying to feel human. In talking with others, I feel intangible, fake, this intellect in human form but incapable of human understanding. My emotions are real; love, hate, empathy, grief, anger, happiness, but I still do not feel ""real"". I feel like I am missing some vital component that ties it all together, and without it, I am nothing more than this body walking around, emulating those around me, operating on some kind of autopilot. It goes beyond frustration and confusion, and I feel this pent up rage building inside of me, and I want to scream at the top of my lungs until I turn blue, throw a chair through a window, send dishes crashing to the floor, something through which I can channel the anger and get it as far from me as possible. And then, sorrow. Black as an abyss, tormenting hopelessness, and it is then that I contemplate suicide. Fortunately (or not) I will then remember something, some reason for why I can't do it. The other day was my sisters birthday. I didn't want her to have to remember her birthday as the day her sister killed herself. Then I bawl, because there is no way out. I can't leave, and staying means continued torment for me and the people I love, and for some reason, love me. How long must I endure this cycle? Once again I am off medication. After the birth of my third child I went on the latest wonder drug, Lexapro, and after a year with no improvement I've abandoned that as well. I also made another mental health check in when the baby (now 1 1/2) was a few months old, for six days in duration, and once again came out feeling like a hundred bucks only to crash again. I've examined the perspective that, like the books title, ""Depression is a Choice"", and have even embraced the idea. I've also embraced the idea that it is certainly not a choice, and that medication is the solution, with equally unhelpful results. I grow weary of this fruitless search to ""fix myself"". For those of you who would suggest God, yes I am a believer. I turned to him three years ago, after years of Agnosticism, in utter desperation to fill in the ""missing link"". But for whatever reason, He still isn't enough. Which is the biggest blow of all, because I truly comprehend the sacrifice that was made in my behalf with the Atonement, and yet for some reason fail to utilize it. So here I am. One big mess. And I'm joining the group, lucky you!

Why put yourself through an existence of pain?  How many lives have been lived in pain and died in them? Nobody asks for an existence, it's thrust upon you.

"Desperately want to WANT TO get better Attempted suicide May 1st, wasted a week of my life in “voluntary” inpatient, was put on the one drug that has ever helped me (olanzapine, an antipsychotic) which I then promptly had an allergic reaction to, got off of, and crashed again. Was able to drag myself through some intensive outpatient group therapy for a while and then quit that too. The only good thing I have left in my life is my fiancé. I know it’s not healthy to live for another person but I’m not exactly in a position to nitpick. At this point all I can do for them is try to be as reliable as possible while also isolating myself more often than not so that they don’t have to deal with a constantly suicidal person more frequently than they can handle. But I want more? I want to be able to grow with them and be an active part of a life they enjoy? I want to repay them for all the things they do in vain to try to make me happy? But all of my options in recovery range from extremely corny (literally all talk therapy, individual and group, dbt to cbt to emdr) to actually detrimental to my health (reactions to and side effects from medications).

I'm married, no kids, quit school a couple years ago, just working the same job for five years, going nowhere.  I'm afraid of any kind of change, and I sometimes feel like life is pointless.  I get in these ruts where I'm stuck in this deep, dark pit of anguish and depression and everything feels completely hopeless.  It comes and goes, but these past few weeks have been particularly bad.  I was diagnosed several years ago with ocd, which has a lot to do with it, since I work myself into a frenzy of worry, imaging the worst possible scenarios for every situation, and I just shut down and don't want to think about anything, and it's hard to pull myself together and function like a normal human being.

"My weight is ballooning out of control.  I take daily:  40 MG of Prozac (in the morning);  1 MG Klonopin (same time): 1 MG Klonopin (5 PM) 1 MG Klonopin (bedtime), prescribed by a psychiatrist.  I also take 1000 MG Keppra at bedtime for migraine prevention (prescribed by a neurologist).  I've been on various combinations of these for a couple of years.  The psychiatrist is doggedly insistent that the medications I'm on shouldn't be making me gain weight - but nonetheless they are.  I've had other medications that have given me side effects that I ""shouldn't"" have had - but nonetheless I do.  I have read many, many stories on the internet and through direct conversation with others that say they have had exactly the same things happen with SSRI's.  When I've asked him to change the medication, he keeps preaching ""diet and exercise"".  It hasn't worked.  I'm now down to the point where I eat virtually nothing and today I exercised to the point where I nearly blacked out.  This is causing problems between my wife and I (she also sees the same psychiatrist and takes Klonopin and Effexor), not least because I have no sexual desire.  None.  She sees him (the psychiatrist) tomorrow but I don't see him until April 6.  Yesterday in my therapy session I had an angry outburst that maybe I should just quit taking all the medication (because maybe I'm over medicated) and she didn't like that too much.  Am I going to have to die of obesity or over exercise to get his attention?  What do I have to do to convince them?  This is not helping my depression any when I can't stand to even look at myself in the mirror.

"The Last of Us I just finished my second playthrough, PS3 (im poor, sue me bitch). after the part with the cannibals, ellie sat on a bench and didn't talk much. this, in combination with when she says ""he tried to..."" to joel after she kills david, made me get a bit angry and sad. then i thought about my female friends (few as they may be) and family and how if any ever hurt them in such a way, especially my family, well i think it's better if that's left unsaid. had to pause the game for a min to cry. i never thought i'd be so depressed that a video game could make me cry (and i've played a lot of games, over 1,200 trophies on PSN. only this one made me cry). and in retrospect, i now think i've come to appreciate at least one aspect of my depression: emotion and the appreciation of it. sometimes i can look at someone, there body language, listen to them and feel there pain, suffering and sadness. i now appreciate The Last of Us, life and other people more. although i did feel more alone afterwards (especially since i think it'd be wonderful to find a girl that has a personality like ellie's. never had a gf, had any physical romantic interaction with a girl or even been on a date. i was 12 when the game was released and will probably still be 16 when part 2 comes out, so we ain't dealin with no pedo shit in these christian suburbs) it was definitely worth it.   -just thought i'd share that in the hopes that it would brighten someone's day.

" Hi you, this is me. Me, this is you.  Now that introductions are over, I'm gonna give you a chance to get to know me. Don't screw this up, or yknow, nothing will happen. I think I should point out that this is my first blog ever. and it's something I decided to do on a whim at 8 o clock on a Sunday night after I basically got fired from my job.  Oh, did I pique your interest?  Well if I did, here's what happened. Yesterday, I called in and told them I would be picking up my two weeks notice, this got miscommunicated as ""Hey, I'm quitting right now"" and as I went in today, I was asked ""Didn't you quit."" Anywho, to make a long story short, I ended up in a mixture of quitting/getting fired.   Im fine with it, I have to start school in a couple week anyway.  But that's in the past, and Im sure no-one reading this is interested in my past, only what might future might hold, and exactly where my present lies.  So here's the present: I'm a guy. I have a girl. Me and said girl just got gerbils on Saturday. The gerbils names? Cactus Jack Daniels and Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves. They're outlaws! :)  I am unemployed as of today and going back to school in a couple of weeks. I've never been especially good in school, but not because I'm dumb. It's because I've never decided to go through the effort of doing anything in class, or at home for that matter. I guess that is pretty dumb. For what it's worth though, I ace all my exams.  The girl, y'know, the one I was telling you about before? The on with the gerbils, well, she is my love, and my everything. You'll definantly hear reference to her later in my blogging adventure.    I have just decided that I should change names to protect all of the people involved in my eccentric adventures, y'know, don't want to leave all their things laying about for their mom to find now do we?  I'll decide on names later, but i think the gerbils will get to keep their names as they are. For now however, Jack and Robbie are making a lot of noise, so, I'll post what I have and go attend to them, maybe I'll write something else later.

"Well, a little update then. For those who don't know me that well yet, (which is everybody I suppose) I'm the 20 (almost 21) year old that chose to take a break from school, due to pff what'll it be? Anxiety, depression, health problems regarding sleep/energy. I tried it again at some point, but after 2 weeks found myself to be, not cured yet. I figured it had to end, so I went looking for help. Social worker, well that's all nice and stuff, but not too helpful. Then the official psychiatrists. Well let's pick up from there; the first one, in the Adolescents department directed me to another shrink after the first intake meeting, my help question; not sure. But something was keeping me from being able to fit in the system. I also had concentration problems but she didn't want to dig into that. So this new shrink, on a different department, made me fill in some forms and we had some talks (2) and well, apparently the concentration problem IS a big issue and causing a lot of damage as well as my past (divorced parents, being bullied all my life etc etc.) Okay fine, so I says; maybe I need something to help me sleep? And she suggested I go see my house doctor and ask for sleeping medicines. Which I got, and used for two weeks now and ...nothing. Well, the first 2 days were good, the 2 after that were less good, and I don't even remember the ones after that. I woke up automatically, and sometimes sleep was okay. But after 2 weeks I'm still SO tired everyday, it's killing me. I try and keep up a new rhythm, but it's so exhausting and I feel like doing all sorts of happy things but I just don't have the energy and then I go do it anyway and I end up so hurt and tired. Now, I can't take the medicines for more than two weeks, so today was going to be my last. Well, I sort of should have read the booklet I got with it before use. It said I shouldn't take them EVERY day but every other day, and like I don't know, it says it builds up and stays in your body. Well, I'm fine don't worry. They warned about some side effects, but I seem to have been okay. However, the side effects include ALL the things I already suffered from BEFORE even taking the darn medicines!!! So it's been a complete and utter waste. This one day, I tried sleeping without medicines, and I just couldn't...just, can't fall asleep. So yeah, I had that talk with yet another shrink today, and now he wants me to see some other person. And he thinks I SHOULDN'T take sleeping medicines. So like, ARGH, people keep telling me opposite things, and now they want me to see this person, who'll help me fill in my days and get organized??? That's all cool and well and all, but I got there myself already. I figured it all out before I even started seeing these ""professionals"" and now they're telling me what I already came up with on my own??? It's another 3 week wait. And I don't know anymore. I'm confused about all this, and beginning to think it's been a huge mistake in the first place. And now that it's Spring again, I'm feeling sort of happy. So depression is still here, but, I don't notice it much...or do I? I'm still feeling so alone and my family still doesn't get me...I just want out, I just want to be away from here, which brings us back to the original problem. I'm so annoyed, and after this, today is just going to be another day that I just don't do anything useful... Sure I want to go back to school, but it takes time...I have some time, then again I don't... I had so many plans, and ARGH this sleeping problem, which is going to be my main focus now, is just so darn annoying. I could listen to countless pieces of advice, but in the end, it's just no good to me... Even the stupid sleeping medicines don't work...And every time I go see a shrink about one problem, they point me to someone else, and then another problem bothers me and they send me back but that still didn't fix my first problem. I'm like, fine I'll go fix this darn problem myself then. (I really feel like cursing, but I won't because it's not proper so I'll release some rage when I'm done here, but just know that I'm really upset and annoyed).

" Sometimes I have a crazy notion that runs through my head.  It's actually more like a recurring question that puzzles me at odd times and places but usually when I see some otherwise taken for granted ingenious invention.  For example, it happened this past Sunday as I sat in an Emergency Room waiting area (a friend had been bitten by a dog...) as I watched the automatic sliding glass doors.  What a wonderful and convenient invention.  A sensor detects your presence and opens the door.  Then it hit me...What would Benjamin Franklin think of that?   I think of Ben and what he would think quite often when I hear the telephone ring, see airplanes in the sky or cars on the road.  Just the idea of electricity (that covers lights, the radio, television, motion pictures...The list is endless), the concept of the internal combustion engine, the physics of flight...  Just think of how much fun it would be to tool around with Ben showing him all the things we've manage to create.  Can you imagine explaining how man has walked on the moon?  How would he react to hearing that we have a satellite circling, capturing data, recording it and reporting back to Earth from the planet Saturn?  We have come so far and have so much.  Ben would be very impressed with everything...   That's usually when another of my recurring thoughts hits me.  He'd be impressed with all the gadgets and inventions but eventually he'd see what kind of society we've become.  He'd be appalled by our lack of education in light of all the technological marvels.  Sure, it took a smart person somewhere to figure out the concepts of the new technology...But look what we've given up in return.  For all our efforts we have people that can't read and write...People that don't have or use their imaginations...People that can't think for themselves...People that are happiest doing no more than mindlessly doing nothing.  Our Great Society has become stupid, ill mannered, uncaring and lazy.  It's a shame really.  And I'm certain that Ben wouldn't like it...

" Last night Jerry Douglas came to town and played a free concert. That guy is SO GOOD. He made me want to learn to play the dobro. And the best part was that his fiddle player had a mohawk. It was kind of like the whole band was saying, ""Even though we play bluegrass instruments, we're WAY beyond bluegrass."" They even had the same bass player as Nickel Creek. I wonder if that guy goes around joining bluegrass bands and then turning them into non-bluegrass bands. Or maybe in this case it was Jerry's idea. Maybe he got too sick of bluegrass from playing with Alison Krauss. Well it was a really great concert, nonetheless.

"I'm a 24 year old woman living in Florida with my husband. I have been severely depressed for 6 months, and now looking back I can see that it actually started about a year and a half ago. If only I could go back and warn myself.  Like many of you, I have been suffering depression since I was very young. In fact, I can remember being in first grade, coming home and going to bed for the rest of the night. Of course, back then it felt more like fear. In 7th grade, I asked my mother if I was a manic depressive because I had read about it and I felt I had all the symptoms. She scoffed and said it was just normal teen hormones that made me feel that way.  I love my mother and she has always been there for me. I used to call her at 2 in the morning crying and she would talk to me until I felt better. However, when I call her up today, she still doesn't understand when I tell her I am depressed. She thinks I need to get up and start doing things until I snap out of it. I try to tell her I have bills screaming at me and I still can't get out of the house to find work. I think she is in denial. Now, with all of the information I find on this site, I think I may even be bipolar.  When I found the man I wanted to marry, I warned him that I had experienced many deep depressions in my lifetime and that it was probably likely to happen again someday. He said he would stay by my side no matter what, and he has. Unfortunately, it is painfully apparent that he has no idea at all how to handle it. When he tries to talk to me and cheer me up, I say mean things to him until we are both raising our voices. Let me tell you, when I'm like this, I don't back down either. I usually say something hurtful and then grind my teeth in anger for a while. He gets mad too, but it is also painfully apparent that he forgives me. Then, I feel like a real jerk.  I just started seeing a psychologist, since I haven't had a job since last August and it's clear that I don't know my way out of this. I have only met with her once, but I think I will like her. She has told me to do a few simple things everyday until our next meeting on Wednesday. She wants me to get 1/2 hour of sunlight everyday, 15 minutes of exercise, and try to make a simple daily schedule to follow. I'm a bit worried because I haven't been able to do them because I just don't sleep right anymore. It is 8am and I haven't slept yet. I may fall asleep in a few hours, only to toss and turn and then wake up in the evening feeling like crap. I have tried some medicines but they don't help. Have any of you had this problem? What did you do?

"My mom wants to see me... naked? Whew, so my parents moved to America from Korea and had my sister and I. They still stick to their homeland culture and tradition, but I've become accustomed to how things are done in America. Where kids have privacy and all. My mom has been pestering me to see me naked. She says it's to size me to buy bras, but I don't think so. She invades my personal privacy a lot, like butt slapping and I sometimes catch her staring at my privates. She comments on if I'm wearing a bra or not and I find it kind of creepy. I get that it may be normal in Korean culture, but I've asked her to stop since I feel uncomfortable. She said no, simply because she gave birth to me. Whenever I'm changing, she barges into my room barely even a second after knocking and stares at me when I'm semi naked. I asked her for some privacy, after all, I'm almost 13, but she rejects it. My mom made plans to go to a public bathhouse, but I told her I don't want to. She wants to drag me out and ""rub all the dead skin cells off my back"" but I feel like she only wants to see me naked. She recently got breast implants and keeps bragging about how she increased in size, and how she's regaining her youth. I'm happy that she is, but now I feel like she's shaming me for being flat. Hello? I'm 12. She tells me about how much bigger she was in comparison to other girls back then, then shows my sister her cleavage. I asked my mom if breasts define a woman, you know how she replied? Yes. If you want to fit in, yes. If you want to be able to wear todays modern clothes, yes. If you want to attract men, yes. I honestly LIKE being flat, but my mom says I'll change my mind. I respect the fact that I may, but I'm still sort of annoyed. I think she just wants to see me naked. Not as a parent, but as an inspector. I don't know if it's exactly normal in Asian culture, but I feel extremely uncomfortable. Any advice? Sorry if I sounded sorta whiney.

" I am addicted to blogs!  After reading my friend Beth and Cs's blog, I was intrigued...I had a site on diaryland, but after so much time of not logging in, it was dismanteled, so to say.  Anyway, on Cs's page she has blogs that she reads, and lists as favorites or something like that, so I clicked on a few, and became addicted.  How weird that I can get so excited about logging onto AOL to read about people's lives that I don't even know, and they don't even know that I exist!  Weird, if ya ask me, but nonetheless, I am creating my own in hopes of someone's enjoyment in reading about my somewhat boring, but exciting life, to others...Let us begin shall we?

How exciting...It's for my friend Jamie, a friend that I've known about 20 years...What a great girl she is.  Anyway, went to Wal*Mart afterwards, bought some fun stuff, I love that store, it always has cool little things around there...And of course, they always stare at me saying ""buy me, buy me"".  Well I was a good girl, bought some scrapping stuff, and some other d0-dads, and I was out of there.  I had today off, went and got my haircut and went into the store (work - CVS/Pharmacy) to see what was going on with the girls.  I am a manager there (well, shift supervisor t0 be exact, but in about a year I'll have my own store as the manager).  Anyway, that was about it, came home, ate dinner, talked to a few people, and scrapped for a few hours, I am working on something special, can't tell ya in case someone reads this, I don't want to spoil a surprise...It's getting kinda late, and I have an 11 hour work day tomorrow, so I am off to the bed.

" Labour leaders more often than not tell us how they will ""die in the Party"". Blair said that he wasn't born in to the party but he will die in it. I now know that this is a very useful device for making people rule out the idea of ever leaving Labour and it's a phrase that sounds good, and it's one I've copied and used myself for dramatic effect. But when it came to it, when this War criminal leader decided to throw in his lot with George Bush, stayiong in the Labour was not an option. What should have been the most difficult decision I've ever had to make (after 10 years flogging my guts out for it)  leaving the Labour Party was not only an easy decision but essential. How could anyone stay in a Party that stains itself in the blood of thousands of Iraqi civilians, dropping cluster bombs on them against the will of the UK and International community, against the UN, against the Law and for George W Bush, Rumsfeld, Cheney - Financial and War criminal one and all - and with the Tories, Berlusconi, John Howard, and Aznar.  We couldn't even be bothered to count the bodies. If anyone stayed in the Labour Party after Abu Graihb I wonder what they joined the Labour for in the first place. If it wasn't for justice and for an ideal that may or may not be obtainable, at least it was aspirational for humanity. I can't even begin to list the sheer number of crimes against people, society and democracy that this Labour Party has been responsible for and every single member is to blame. Your money has paid for a montrous, election winning machine that believes in privatisation, War and inequality. All the talk of saving the Labour Party from Blair is to miss the point. When a Party becomes part of the problem it doesn't deserve to survive. The dead children in Iraq will never be brought back. A new leader will not be able to lessen the personal pain I feel knowing that by helping to elect this Labour Government I also have blood on my hands. The Tories would never have got the votes in the Commons to conduct such a filthy War. Only a Labour Party wilting at the feet of it's Leader could have pulled this off. I will never rejoin the Labour Party and stand shoulder to shoulder with people who justify slaughter in such an ignorant detatched manner. My new pledge is that I will die outside the Labour Party.

"hot and cold friend I do quite a bit of online gaming on console the past year and have made some great friendships during the span of time. Some of them have developed into stronger friendships (we bond on more than just gaming). I became close with one guy in particular and I'd say he's become one of my best friends. We met each other through a mutual group but through shared interests and our ease in conversation, we became close enough to add each other on various social platforms and IM. Initially, we texted all the time but I've been noticing very recently, his texts have gotten shorter and less frequent. I get that eventually friendships can go through lulls but I feel like things have changed. I had always thought he was very sweet and affectionate; always asking about my day, initiating conversations, and just being a kind friend in general. If it's been a couple of hours and i haven't replied, he'd message me to check up. I admit it was a bit intense at first but I had gotten used to it and reciprocated. But now that he's kind of dropped off, I feel like I am becoming overbearing and that's the last thing I want to be. I feel like I'm putting in more effort to keep a conversation going these days. I've brought up the change in our interaction but he reassures me nothing is wrong yet things just aren't what they used to be. On top of that, I am starting to feel this tiny annoyance grow inside of me...I don't nearly game as much as he does so when I do come online, we usually play games together. Sometimes we play with other friends but about half the time or more, we game with each other. We don't really play in groups much because he's a bit of an introvert and doesn't feel comfortable in large group settings. The other day, I was invited to play with a friend we made online. Prior to this, my friend and I had some particularly frustrating games so he was signing off early. But me not wanting to play with our new friend alone, i told him i got an invite and got him back online pretty quick to join me...but the whole time he was kind of silently sulking until he texted me he just thought it was weird that this guy would want to play with me and that was what made him feel weird. Eventually he warmed up and started talking like a normal person so I was happy by the time I called it a night and found that all of them were bonding. These incidents have happened a handful of times in the past month and it's left me slightly annoyed and very confused.

" The first dream was that my little brother brought over season three of The Shield on DVD, but it was a poor quality rip from a VCR recording.  The second dream is that I was out on the beach with my brother and he went into the water and pulled out a morray eel and attempted to behead it. He only got down to the last string before he stopped and it was still alive and cleaning it's self like a cat. I was pretty disturbed by this so I begged him to finish the job and just put it out of it's misery. I know this one is in connection to the recent beheadings in the middle east.

" Well, today started off OK, I guess. Since my parents sold their restaraunt, they've been off for a bit, but my mom just started working part time at a green house about a minutes walk from my buddy's place. So I had to get up 6:30, which sucked. She dropped me off at school around 7:00. I was feeling OK, I got to the gym, one of the senior players was there. Talked to him for a minute or two, before I worked on some ball handling and shot around a bit.   I wasn't feeling it today, dunno what happened. Nothing seemed to be fallin'. Foul shot was off, the works. But you know, that happens sometimes. Some of the senior girls showed up, we shot around and talked for a bit. Nothing special. I finished off the morning with a game or twenty-one with this kid from my team named Chance. He's gotta be my favorite Rook' on the team. Seems a lot of the other ones are bitches. I was ice cold. I barely won the damn thing. I wasn't impressed at all.   Yeah, anyway, went to Math, got my test results back. 82%. Meh, I wasn't too excited, I wasn't disappointed, but I feel I could do better. Mark went up to 77%. I'm really underachieving this semester. Parents are riding me a bit. Then I went to English, lunch came, same old, same old. French, doing OK in that. Then I went to Socials, as usual Ms. Brown was a bitch.   Hopped on the bus, went home, wasn't feeling great. Came on the computer did some shit on here. Then I went and watched Sacramento play Minnesota. I was not impressed with that missed lay-up by C-Web. Cost 'em the mother fuckin' game. Garnett was nuts, as usual.   MVP style. MVP class. MVP ability.   He's a sick mother fucker I'll tell ya that much. After the game was done I watched the end of the Calgary, San Jose game. Man, everyone here in Van-City has jumped on the Calgary bandwagon and I'm pissed OFF. They're going to the Cup, everyone couldn't be happier, except me. Bastards.   Anyway, that's today for ya.

"Hi, I have posted a few responses on the forum, but this will be my first thread. I guess I am wondering if I truly suffer from depression or another mental illness. I have not seen a psychologist or a therapist, but I have been reading your threads for the last few weeks. My heart goes out to you and I wish that I could lend more support than I can. I know that my situation is not nearly as dire as many of you, but I still ponder whether I have a iproblemi. For the last couple of years, I have experienced an increase in mood swings. I will be doing fine and then a ilight switchi goes off, and I get a bad case of the blues. These can last for a few of days. In my mind, I know that everything is actually okay, but I can't shake the idowni feeling. I also have frequent bouts of being istressed-outi. By this I mean that all of the tasks that I need to get done seem to be insurmountable and that there will never be enough time to get things done. I sometimes break down in tears during my more manic attacks of frustration and worry. Life seems to have become one long list of stuff to do. Even the fun stuff has become something to get done so that I can move on to the next day. As for itriggersi, as I have been reading about in your posts, I know that I have two major issues. I don't deal well with my emotions when my husband gets angry (not abusive, just normal iguy angryi) or I feel that I have somehow iscrewed-upi and let him down by not doing something right. I turn very inward and the ilight switchi goes off. My second issues deals with embarrassment. I do not take embarrassment well. My stress/anxiety over getting the housework done stems from my concern that people may come over and I will be embarrassed by the state of the house (in fact, the house is always neat and clean, if a bit disheveled by daily life). I often worry about whether I embarrassed myself during social outings or at parties with my friends. My husband reassures me, but that doesn't usually ease my worry. My ObGyn gave me Sarafem (Prozac 20mg) three weeks ago, and I seem to be operating on a more even keel these days. The lows aren't as low and I seem to be able to let more stuff just roll off my back. I am pleased with the results, and my husband has seen a real improvement, but I am still asking myself the basic question as to whether I am indeed ill. Please provide some feedback if you can, as this is the first time that I have tried to really tell folks about how I feel.",1,hi posted response forum thread guess wondering truly suffer depression mental illness not seen psychologist therapist reading thread week heart go wish lend support can know situation not nearly dire you ponder iproblemi couple year experienced increase mood swing doing fine ilight switchi go off bad case blue day mind know actually okay shake idowni feeling frequent bout istressedouti mean task need insurmountable time thing done break tear manic attack frustration worry life long list stuff do fun stuff day itriggersi reading post know major issue not deal emotion husband get angry not abusive just normal iguy angryi feel iscrewedupi let not doing right turn inward ilight switchi go off second issue deal embarrassment not embarrassment well stressanxiety getting housework stem concern people come embarrassed state house in fact house neat clean bit disheveled daily life worry embarrassed social outing party friend husband reassures me doe not usually ease worry obgyn gave sarafem prozac mg week ago operating keel day low not low able let stuff just roll back pleased result husband seen real improvement asking basic question ill provide feedback can time tried really tell folk feel
"Female reasoning Why does it seem most women try to justify or get approval of a friendship with a male by stating knowing then for a lengthy time. Do women truly feel that no platonic boundaries will be broken because they’ve “known each other for 15 years/since freshman year” etc.  I don’t believe it impossible for a platonic opposite sex friendship, but I do feel it is much harder for a male, for several reasons. Men typically seem to misinterpret a female being nice as expressing interest or flirting, that can easily plant the seed for a romantic attraction to develop. A mans “natural desires” and wants, can easily blur the lines, and when in the right environment/setting they feel it is acceptable to attempt something etc etc.  I don’t see how whatever length of time negates the possibility of anything happening.   Do women honestly feel because of a long friendship ensures its innocence? Or just an excuse/reason given in an attempt to “justify” or have that friendship accepted by their significant other.

" Yesterday when I was browsing I found this link. How? I can't even remember, I was looking for something totally different. I started reading some of the blogs and since I've been so lonely lately, I decided to try to write some of things that come to my mind. One of the things that I can start talking about is how my life has change from last year. Now I'm single again. I got a divorce. I can't say all the fault was his but mostly yes, he cheated on me. I think the hardest part has past. Now I need to look forward and try not to think about ...what if? I did everything possible to save my marriage, because I have a little daugther and I wanted her to have a family ...forever. The same way I did when I was single (the first time). I'm so lucky to have the parents I have and the sisters I have. Now I appreciate all the efforts that both my parents did to keep us all together and happy.  (Today is the birthday of one of my sisters, by the way) So, the point is that all the perspectives I had about life changed with this tragic episode in my life. Really, everything I believed before is kind of ...gone. I just hope that divorce is not the same for everyone, because mine has been hard mostly probably because of the relegion beliefs I had. I said I had cause now everything looks so different. I'm so happy for all the people that has found love, true love, now I realize that having someone to share your time and ideas is one of the most imnportant things we can have, more than money. (Of course money always helps). Sometimes I think if I will be able to trust again, you know as a partner and find someone that I can count on. Someone to grow old and have wonderful memories, Do you think is there such a person for me? Last night I was thinking about all the relationships I have had in my life and always end up the same way. Men cheating or maybe is me being to naive.   I'm liseting Rod Stewart an old song, I like to liseting the oldies, well I'm not that young, I'm 43, although I don't feel so old. I like to exercise and do a lot of things with my daugther and her friends. I guess most of the tv shows I know are from Disney channel. An about movies well most of the movies for kids. I have had so many challenges in my life but definetely this one is one of the hardest to pass. I'll let you know how I'm doing later...

" Sputter...sputter..Today TODAYYYY (he!

Shadow them . which meant we would have to observe them going about doing their job. this whole exercise was to be completed in a span of 7 hours and also required us not to spend any money on any form of hired aomutation , which would now mean that we would have to go about the entire city (which means many corporates)..Hitch hiking.  with initial few hitches we all ultimately were off to our vaguely targetted destinations. i chose to go to the office of the Daimler Chrystler india situated at the farthest end off the city.i managed to reach the destination by hitch hiking  snd managing some how.aafrom then it was smooth sailing as i have my brother in law working with D.C. India . upon entering the office of D C India i was interoduced to two of the German executives on deputation from germany i had a 1 hour session with him as far as shadowing is concerned it was a complete no no with DC India as they said it was not a company policy to allow any such activity . all set and done by the end of it all i managed to reach my B school campus on time .    we then had a session with our teacher to discuss the procedings of the day . it was a wonderful learning experience and i would cherish this experience for times to come.

I told my friend not to go to a football game and I still went. I'm a guy who doesn't like having to wait for others. I get things done faster on my own. He was coming an hour away and he's visiting from out of state so he doesn't know the area. Apparently he was gonna borrow a friends car but wasn't sure all before the game started in a few hours. I was like screw it I'm not dealing with this.  I basically convinced him not to go saying it was too expensive and that you'll get lost. I was being honest and he agreed. I wasn't gonna wait for him not knowing when he would arrive. I still went and I don't care. Sometimes you just have to be selfish and look out for yourself.

She basically smokes weed to shut out all the bad stuff and usually only does this when our daughter is in bed. A lot of the time she has threatened to kill herself and this has happened in front of my daughter I'm sure  which is so wrong. Today when I went round she started getting angry and I heard my daughter say to her 'if you don't stop I will run in front of a car when I'm older'. This has broke my heart completely and I don't know what to do. I hope my daughter doesn't mean this and is just copying her mum, but this is only gonna get worse as she gets older.

"Is it bad that I am kind of mad my friend never follows my advice? The friend in question and I have been friends for over 7 years and best friends for the last 3 years and have shared just about every detail of our life. I am a very observant person and have seen many repetitions in her behavior over the last years.  The heading is a bit misleading here. I am not mad at her that she doesn’t follow my advice. Rather, I am somewhat annoyed that she keeps making the same mistakes with the same toxic people in her life. I have been telling her that many of the people she surrounds herself with are very manipulative and are using her in one way of another as she has actually realized that, however she can’t seem to actually do anything about this and keeps sacrificing her own needs to satisfy those of the people around her. This doesn’t just happen once or twice, but it happens almost on a daily basis and I can basically feel her mental stability deteriorating. I have been telling her for forever that she should focus on her personal growth and leave the toxic people in her life behind. I know that that is super hard to do and super easy to says and that you can’t follow that super easily and I have been trying very hard to be as supportive as I can and listen to her and be a shoulder to cry on. But it’s also very hard to see her being hurt over and over again by the same type of people or even the same person when there is a solution to the problem. And it seems like she isn’t learning and instead she is just getting more and more insecure and anxious and her panic attacks are increasing in frequency because of these people. And it also makes me very anxious when I constantly worry about her. But I don’t want to guilt or manipulate her into any decisions. And I don’t know what to do. help pls im desperate.

So i had to go and park half a mile down the road  and run to their house in the flood...and ya i know im dumb but i wore those really cheap old navy sandals and well lemme tell ya... you cant run in themm...especailly if theyre wet...ya basically im saying that i fell on the way there but i eventually got there and it was packed out... but the food was good and the people were cool so i had fun for the most part until i discovered the chips and hot sauce...IT WAS SOOO good...i loved it..it just set ur mouth on FIYYYAA  but not too much and ya it was goodddd.

" Well, last night it stormed something fierce. Thunder, lightning and tons of rain. It sure made a nice evening to crochet. I finished with the 6th square now, and have started the one with the cluster braid. It is not hard at all, and seems to be going fairly quickly. I like this part. I will try to finish this one today. I have a terrible headache, so I don't know how much I will get to do.  I am working on my squares in the order, going down the left, in strips. Once I have 9 squares done, in the first row, I will attach them together and begin to really see some progress. It only has 7 strips, so once you get one done, it will go smoothly from then on out.  Well, until next time - happy crocheting from my hook to yours!

"How to help my mom make friends? My parents have had a rocky relationship since I've known them, some times worse than others. Over the years, my father's caustic conversationalism and other factors has caused my mom's friendships to fade away. She's been quite depressed in the past couple of years, although in a slightly better frame of mind lately.   They're in their 50s and recently had to move 2 hours away from their longtime home for my dad's work, and my mom is rather isolated.   How can I help her make friends? They live in the country and can't really even get internet at their house right now. My dad has mellowed slightly with age, and is *generally* well-intentioned but clueless as to how this affects her and what she needs.   Any tips would be great.",0,help mom make friend parent rocky relationship known them time worse others year father caustic conversationalism factor caused mom friendship fade away quite depressed past couple year slightly better frame mind lately s recently hour away longtime home dad work mom isolated help make friend live country really internet house right now dad mellowed slightly age generally wellintentioned clueless affect need tip great
"Silent friendships SOS Hello good people of Reddit,  My BFF (since like kindergarten) is one of the most important people in my life and I absolutely adore her. We’re different but complimentary personalities and have always gotten along great.   (She’s an INFJ Enneagram 1 and I’m an INFP enneagram 4 for reference if you’re into that kind of thing)  ANYWAY, we’ve always had an issue (or at least I have) with communication. I love and value conversations with friends. She does too, but when we’re together we rarely have conversation. She doesn’t respond to a lot of my attempts to make conversation (which honestly makes me feel like an idiot, and over the top.)  We recently decided to room together and it’s completely exacerbated the silence and my own insecurities. It’s hard for me to continue to update her on my life and ask for updates on hers when the conversation is so strained - and this is my main confidant, best friend in the entire world.  I know she values our friendship and cares about me. She’s just quiet. And I’m insecure about that. I just don’t know how to live with the lack of conversation because I feel like there’s a lack of friendship in our quiet apartment.  I really would appreciate your insights, as I want to either confront the situation - or my own issues - and make things better. I would love to hear your experiences with friends and conversation and introversion. Do you have friendships that are silent? SOS!

" It's the middle of summer and I can't sleep, I haven't talk to my friends in a while I wonder what they been up to. Anyways I've leaned something this summer about me. One thing being why I feel depressed and why I get irritate easily. I've discovered that when I'm not with a crowd of people I don't feel depressed or get irritate easily. Which is like my brother which sucks because all school is a crowd of basically adults acting like 6 year olds.

"Possessive friends Hi there, this is my first post. I became friends with a girl from my new class this year (who i had never met until we came into the same class) and became good friends with each other.She has a big network of friends and is quite different from me(talks to everyone, likes everyone, an extrovert). One day, a boy who happens to be her best friend saw us talking and got angry(for the life of me, i do not know why) and started making fake rumors about me, which she blindly believed. when she came to confront me about these false allegations, i flipped out and got quite angry and i have not talked to her for 3 days. Her friends are determined to hate me for some unknown reason and at the same time the girl has to problem with this, even defending them, saying that they are just very possessive of her. I am in a dilemma on what to do, ignore the hate or to stop caring and ignore her.",0,possessive friend hi there post friend girl new class year who met came class good friend othershe big network friend quite different metalks everyone like everyone extrovert day boy happens best friend saw talking got angryfor life me not know why started making fake rumor me blindly believed came confront false allegation flipped got quite angry not talked day friend determined hate unknown reason time girl problem this defending them saying just possessive her dilemma do ignore hate stop caring ignore her
"This morning M finally confessed and now I know the truth: This IS summer here. I realize I spend a lot of time talking about food, the weather and nudity on this blog, but these seem to be re-occurring themes of my new life and, really -- what's more important than having nice food while naked in excellent weather? Not much, I say. So, despite the long arduous months of patiently awaiting the promised beauty of a Dutch summer, what I'm really getting is this: Virtually constant canopy of gray/black clouds? Check! Scarves and light jackets lest the freezing summer temperatures turn your nipples to stone? Check! Got your umbrella for sudden downpours that may or may not contain hail? Check Check! Surly attitude because you can't wear your pretty sandals (unless you like blue toes) and your boyfriend's been lying to you for months about the upcoming lekker warm weather? Check and check and check! Try to ignore that previous blog entry within which I detailed all the nice things about Holland at this time of year and the fact that the weather was oven-hot. Apparently, that was a freak of nature. Though I do still love the little lambs.",1,morning m finally confessed know truth summer here realize spend lot time talking food weather nudity blog reoccurring theme new life and really important having nice food naked excellent weather not much say so despite long arduous month patiently awaiting promised beauty dutch summer really getting this virtually constant canopy grayblack cloud check scarf light jacket lest freezing summer temperature turn nipple stone check got umbrella sudden downpour not contain hail check check surly attitude wear pretty sandal unless like blue toe boyfriend lying month upcoming lekker warm weather check check check try ignore previous blog entry detailed nice thing holland time year fact weather ovenhot apparently freak nature love little lamb
"Why I always let myself fooled... Why I always think there is something more than there really is... I always think I'm good friends with someone and I act accordingly. I try to be that good friend. Then at some point I always realize that it's not a real friendship. The other one didn't think it that seriously. The other one just talked with me because at that time it was fun. It feels crushing. Realizing every single time that the person you took as a good friend, or even possible friend isn't really thinking same about you. Realizing how stupid, silly and naive you have been thinking that you could be a friend for that person. Realizing how they just are amused that you were so deep involved in it.",1,let fooled think really is think good friend act accordingly try good friend point realize not real friendship did not think seriously just talked time fun feel crushing realizing single time person took good friend possible friend not really thinking you realizing stupid silly naive thinking friend person realizing just amused deep involved it
"I don’t know what I’m doing anymore I feel empty, I feel bored, I feel depressed and I just want to sleep but even the thought of sleeping while there’s so much going on outside this house makes me anxious. Tomorrow I have another test and I’m skipping school again. I already skipped today because I was too lazy to start studying before Sunday and of course I didn’t know shit, so instead of taking responsibility I just skipped school. And I’m skipping again tomorrow because I studied even less for this test. My grandpa, the father of my mother, is risking death in an hospital bed. My mother is with him in the hospital everyday and every night to keep him company in his last moments of his life and she cries everyday. It hurts me so see her suffering so much. And it hurts me to see my grandpa in such critical conditions. I feel like they’re both miserable but I don’t know how to help. I wanna hang out with my friends to get rid of all these bad thoughts but I don’t have many, and if I ask them right now they’ll just answer “sorry, we can’t hang out, we have to study”. Which is true, I know it is because I should study, too. But I don’t. I just spend my days staying at home, listening to music and crying because I’m a pathetic piece of shit. I hate my life. There’s so much monotony in everything. I wanna try new things. I wanna make new friends. I wanna visit new places. I wanna become a new person. But I don’t know how to do it.  Sorry for this mess...
