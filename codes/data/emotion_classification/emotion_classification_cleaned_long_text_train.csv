"My dad says I'm careless but does nothing himself Basically my dad came into my room tonight saying that my mom over heard me and my brothers conversation. (we were talking about how hypocritical he is)  He started to get really mad and started yelling at me because I never do anything the right way or enough.  I usually go out to eat so Im like never in the kitchen, when he comes I to my room and starts  screaming at me because I don't help around the kitchen I'm to scared to tell him that neither does he.... For example he had left his hot dog mess, rice mess, and his dishes in the living room all for us to clean up. Generally my mom would pick  up after him and clean up but she is recovering from an injury that was quite serious. So when he comes into my room and yells at me, exaggerating the problem emmensly, for not helping out, I just want to scream in his face that he doesn't do anything and I'm always picking up after him... Continuing to tell me how careless and irresponsible I am.   I get that I'm not perfect and I do forget some stuff but it just seems like I baby him and I get yelled at if I don't clean up after him.... Someone help me, how can I tell him that he's needs to clean up after himself!

I know he’s been involved with that for a long time, even when he was married with my mom, but he doesn’t know I know all that.   One day I asked him to answer me sincerely what was that, or just say nothing if he didn’t want to. He lied to me but I said nothing.

"My hearing, attentiveness and social awareness has been completely off since dropping into a very low depressive period as of late. Normal? Walking through a busy shopping center today and I feel heavy and zoned out. I ordered food at a bakery and could barely hear my voice as I spoke. I didn't hear the employee very well and unknown to me like 8 high school kids entered as I was browsing and I didn't even notice until I visually saw them.  The sunlight drains me quick. And when crossing a street I often triple take even when absolutely nothing is coming.  Fuck this.

"I've been sleeping with my best friends girlfriend for 3 years?? I'd be lying if I said I don't feel guilty. But on the other hand I still do it. We have been seeing each other behind his back for about 3 or more years every other day. She tells me everything about them. How sex with him is awful. Which I knew already because he asked me what he should do about it. I gave him good advice. I guess it didn't change anything. The sex with her is amazing. I think it's how taboo it is. We're all over each other. She lets me do things to her that She won't let my friend do on her , like anal I was the first one to ever do anal and throat fuck her and STILL do it. She wants a relationship with me and there's no way in hell that's going to happen. She thinks that I'm in love with her and that we will be together. She talks about us running far away together. All I have to do is say the word. I'm a big believer in ""once a cheater, always a cheater"". But she seems to be in love with me. My gut is telling me shes in love with me. My gut is never wrong. I guess I'm doing both of them wrong. I know he uses reddit so I'm not going to give all the details. I also want to add that I still respect the guy a whole lot. I would hate to lose his friendship.

"I guess I’m done with her? Or is there something wrong with my attitude? So, in the Literature class, we did a practice exam paper and we had a peer assessment. One of my friend had my paper and it turns out she graded mine the lowest in the class. The teacher was actually surprised on her harsh mark and said jokingly ‘Hey, he (me) did all right. Isn’t that too harsh?.  Later I approached to her to ask what was it that she gave mine a low grade. Then, she rants out all the things I’ve done wrong, but she spoke so fast that I couldn’t quite catch all of them. And I became a bit angry at her attitude because 1. She spoke so fast (so I couldn’t quite catch 30% of her points) which is likely to be intentional so I’m startled before I can argue back. 2. Majority of her points were about that I lacked explicit points, but the teacher ticked all the points and said they were explicit enough?  So, I said back to her ‘Hey but the teacher said the essay was all right’ She scoffs and says: ‘Yeah, write like that in the real exam and you will totally pass. Who are you kidding?’  Now I wouldn’t really complain if she actually gave me valid constructive criticism, but she spoke so fast (likely to be intentionally) and most of her points came from simply her not reading carefully enough..  BTW, she actually achieves better grades than I do and is clearly smarter than I am. Not trying to be boastful, but in this Literature class, I really think it’s safe to say that I get better grades than her most of the times. And, she’s not a teacher. What the hell does she know better than the teacher to say things like that, especially when she gets lower grades than I do most of the time???  Besides, she really always says rude things in front of someone’s faces (and many many times in front of my face).. and she’s sometimes in her own world and can get really arrogant and cynical.  I guess I’m done with her right? Or is there something wrong with my attitude? I regretted a couple of times being friend with her in the first place, and now I really see that there can be no good staying with her. And, I'm in my final year before graduation... I feel quite embarrassed that I'm complaining about this kind of friendship problem and I know I should be focusing on studying, but thinking about this gets me angry every time.",0,guess her wrong attitude so literature class did practice exam paper peer assessment friend paper turn graded lowest class teacher actually surprised harsh mark said jokingly hey me did right not harsh later approached ask gave low grade then rant thing wrong spoke fast not quite catch them bit angry attitude spoke fast so not quite catch point likely intentional startled argue back majority point lacked explicit point teacher ticked point said explicit enough so said hey teacher said essay right scoff say yeah write like real exam totally pas kidding not really complain actually gave valid constructive criticism spoke fast likely intentionally point came simply not reading carefully enough btw actually achieves better grade clearly smarter am not trying boastful literature class really think safe say better grade time and not teacher hell doe know better teacher say thing like that especially get lower grade time besides really say rude thing face and time face world really arrogant cynical guess right wrong attitude regretted couple time friend place really good staying her and final year graduation feel quite embarrassed complaining kind friendship problem know focusing studying thinking get angry time

"Back pain has brought me to a dark space. I’ve been struggling with back pain for 2 years now and I’m 17.   I play soccer (football), and thats all I know, I’ve played my whole life. I don’t have much friends nor other hobbies besides gaming (very mediocre gamer). However, these pass two years have been terrible. Due to my undying love for the sport, I would try to play through the pain. (regret it) Which has only made me worse. I decided my first Summer with back pain that I would not play for a month. Which I achieved with no real results. I passed the time playing Video games. However, the constant sitting probably made my back worse. I played a tournament that same Summer after the month break. 5 games some sort of international tournament. By the end of the tournament my back had gotten so bad I couldn’t bear to move. Despite all this, I somehow got chosen to go to Spain. Few months later I went to Spain at 16, with back pain, played soccer and such but didn’t get noticed. Fast forward to now and I’ve gone a whole season barley playing and still struggle with back pain. Now I’m 17, I’ve gone this whole Summer without much activity just stretching and ab work outs.   The Summer is almost over and the realization that I haven’t gotten better is  bringing a dark cloud over me. I scream at night out of anger and sadness. I constantly tell myself I want to die(&lt;-Im not sure if this is breaking a rule, sorry in advanced, just tell me and I’ll remove this part), and I cry everyday.   I do most of those things in private, when no one’s home (excluding the random screaming I do at night).  I don’t want my mom to worry about me like she does my diagnosed depressed big brother, and also her dealing with my little brother’s life (He’s 7). On top of all that my mom is a single mom and barley has time for her own life and gets sad easily. (The sight of my mom sad deeply pains me inside) I’ve always been the one kid that could take care of himself. She has even told me personally that she is glad that she doesn’t need to worry too much about me (only deals with my back pain, she takes me to rehab).   I’ve been to the Doctors and have done a MRI, they say its nothing. Just functional.  (Whatever that means...)   Point is, I’m very sad and I feel like I’m getting worse everyday. I don’t know what to do with my life. The one thing I was good at is now gone. I don’t have any other talents or interest.I feel empty without soccer and I don’t know how to feel it.  TL; DR: I’ve played soccer my whole life, got a back injury two years ago and I still haven’t healed. Doctors say its nothing) As a result, I am very sad but I keep it to myself. I’m not good at anything else.

"How much longer can I fake it? I'm 33, had a full-time job for several years and have a young son.  I took a leave from work in 2014 for mental illness, at which point I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, prescribed Zoloft and was back at work when my short term disability ran out.  This was the first time I'd been on anti-depressants.  I felt tired all the time, had no sex drive, and started gaining weight, but at least I was functional.    Over the next year, I received a few verbal warnings and 1 written warning at work about my poor performance.  Eventually, the mask broke and I was on leave again in 2015.  This time I was away for much longer, was diagnosed w/ dysthymia, tried several different medications, found out that just about every SSRI gave me horrible side effects (sweating, nausea, insomnia, no sex drive, I'm actually thinking now that maybe they caused serotonin syndrome) and eventually landed on Remeron and Wellbutrin.  This combo actually started to work, without any side effects (except for weight gain, which I've been managing with a diet now).  This time, I returned to work because I received notice in the mail that my employment was going to be terminated because it was coming up on 2 years without being at work.  I figured if I was going to be fired for not returning, I may as well return, make some money and worst thing that happens is I get fired anyways.  I was not better when I returned to work, I was functional, I was able to smile, but the low mood persisted in a big way.  And so here I am, still working, trying to fake it everyday, feeling like a house of cards thats ready to topple.  I'm afraid because if I go off work again that will have been 3 leaves of absence, and I really don't think I could show my face around here anymore after that.  I remember how horrible my life felt when I was on medical leave.  I remember falling behind on child support, having to borrow money from my parents.  I remember trying to convince my girlfriend that my low sex drive was because of meds and not because of her.  I remember trying to convince an insurance company that I'm sick, while simultaneously trying to convince myself that I can get better.  I remember feeling like a useless waste of skin that drained on the resources of everyone that dared to care about me.  I guess what I'm saying is I know, right now, I'm suffering from depression, and I'm afraid of what might happen if I admit that again.",1,longer fake it fulltime job year young son took leave work mental illness point diagnosed depression anxiety disorder prescribed zoloft work short term disability ran out time antidepressant felt tired time sex drive started gaining weight functional year received verbal warning written warning work poor performance eventually mask broke leave time away longer diagnosed w dysthymia tried different medication just ssri gave horrible effect sweating nausea insomnia sex drive actually thinking maybe caused serotonin syndrome eventually landed remeron wellbutrin combo actually started work effect except weight gain managing diet now time returned work received notice mail employment going terminated coming year work figured going fired not returning return make money worst thing happens fired anyways not better returned work functional able smile low mood persisted big way am working trying fake everyday feeling like house card thats ready topple afraid work leaf absence really not think face anymore that remember horrible life felt medical leave remember falling child support having borrow money parent remember trying convince girlfriend low sex drive med not her remember trying convince insurance company sick simultaneously trying convince better remember feeling like useless waste skin drained resource dared care me guess saying know right now suffering depression afraid happen admit again

" To expand a little on my previous thought.           I spend about 95% of my free time alone.      I am engaged to my childrens father. This is the 3rd time we are engaged.    He wanted to elope, but I feel I deserve a wedding after all that I've been through. We live in different places. I, with the children at my parents house, and him with his mother and family.        His mother had a kidney transplant in December. I understand that he wants to be there for her. But my children and I suffer greatly.  He never comes around. When he does, she (or his sister) calls and he leaves.        Sometimes I think she exaggerates her pain (maybe I sound a little selfish) or maybe exaggerate isn't what I mean. I think she tolerates her pain until she wants attention. I feel bad for her because she suffers alot. But at the same time. I never get to see my ""fiance"" , my kids never get to see their father.     There is a house down the street from her. And the people want around $700    monthly for a 3 bedroom house.  He decided (without me even seeing it) that it wasn't good enough because the house is blue, fiends (drug addicts)   lived   there, and the kitchen is yellow. He can't see taking us from where we are now to move there.        He lives in a 3 bedroom house with about 6 people and a dog. I live in a big 4 bedroom house with my parents, and I am cramped. My son doesn't like to stay here because he thinks my parents don't like him.  My daughter has to stay upstairs with me, because they yell about the house being dirty. She doesn't like it there much either. But he doesn's see moving us from here, because of a freakin yellow kitchen.       I haven't been able to sleep or really eat since he told me this last night.

"My friend wants to use my house, so she can be alone with her boyfriend. Should i let her? So, my friend's got a boyfriend. They're in the ""lovey dovey"" phase right now, and they really want to consummate their relationship, i think they should wait until they're 18, but it's their choice to make.   Anyway, my conflict is this. They want to have sex, but they have nowhere to do it at. They're too poor for a hotel, and both their parents watch them like hawks whenever they're together. Plus, she gets taken too and from school, and her parents chaperone her everywhere else, since she doesn't have a car yet (they are making her work for her vehicle). As for him, his dad never leaves the house, and he has an ""open door"" rule, meaning they have to be where they can be seen and all doors open at all times at his house.   The only time her parents aren't watching her is when she's with me, we hang out a lot on the weekend, so they let her spend the night at my house often, because of my situation on the weekends.   On the weekends, my mother works late evening/nights, and she's gone until almost 6 in the morning.

"My Father and Step-Mother sound like they will be getting a divorce. I have three half siblings whom I'm relatively close to, two of them are teenagers and still under their parents' care. Anyways long story short it's my father's consumption of alcohol that's causing the damage. He does well for awhile then doesn't and it's been going on like this for years. Unfortunately my father and I aren't that close. It almost feels like we're walking acquaintances inside the same home when we have dinner together as a family. He seems distant to everyone in our family as well, it can be hard for him to open up. I think my father is really depressed, but he refuses to see a therapist or anything like that.  He may be going through some sort of (late) midlife crises right now. He still works his job and apparently brings home enough money to support his family. My step-mother took me aside and looked worried about her situation. She expressed that she may need to get legal help, and is concerned about protecting her children. At this point, I'm going to try and open up to my Dad and just point blank ask him what's going on with his life? He's about to lose his wife of 25+ years and hit a hard rock bottom. I hate to see him do this as he's been a pretty good Dad overall, and always provided for his family... at least keeping our heads above water financially. Any thoughts about how to approach alcohol use and possibly getting a stubborn old man to seek help? I know it's gotta be on his terms and everything, but I don't know what else to do.

We have been friends for almost 7 years now. 2 years ago, I (26) started dating my current bf (35). During that time, I was playing hard to get, and I was not really interested in my bf at the time so I would talk about him to my male friend who is in the relationship with my other friend. At one point, my friend told me that my bf is a sucker for love because he was chasing a girl that didn't want him...fastfoward...I accidentally told my bf that my friend called him a sucker and my bf said he doesn't want me being friends with him anymore. When my friend and I spoke about my bf, my bf and I were just dating, we were not bf and gf so I don't think my bf should taken it to the extent that I shouldnt be friends with him.

"I can't stop dreaming about having friends. I don't know why I use this daydreaming technique every single day. I can't trust real people because they always seem selfish to me. I have that weird, twisted image of having a best friend who doesn't judge me and enjoys spending time with me, but it's not real.   People are not perfect and I push them away or worse, I don't and they use me or tease me forever because apparently I'm too kind and I act like a stray animal. What should I do? I'm so lost. How can I escape my dreams? I'm 26 and I don't have any close friends and I end up talking to my cats or my plushy because interacting with humans makes me incredibly tense. I'm on meds.

"Should I support my bestfriends toxic relationship? My bestfriend has been dating a guy for the last 7 years, since they were in high school. She has grown into a gorgeous, and successful woman, while he is still acting like he is 17. She has been in therapy because of trust issues with her boyfriend for 5 years. She continually tells me all the terrible things he does, and how he lies non stop. I obviously want her to feel like she can talk to me about the relationship, but I am getting tired of watching her go through the same thing over and over again, and then the next day they make up. They see each other once a week, (or less). He cant afford a cell phone or a car, he drinks a lot, and he's just a loser in my eyes. He is lazy and waste his money on alcohol and smokes.  She could throw a rock and find a better boyfriend but she's so invested in this relationship its disgusting. She wants to marry this guy eventually, and her excuse is that he just needs to grow up a bit. HES 26! She literally gives him chance after chance, and he continues to screw up, but she is so set on being in the relationship. I know she is more then likely scared of being alone, but after 5 years of him screwing up, you think being alone would be better then being in this one sided relationship. I have no idea what to do, I am scared if I tell her that I don't want to hear anymore about this guy, then ill be a bad friend, but I also cant stand by while this guy continues to treat her like shit, and she continues to take it. What would you do? Would you be honest? Or would you stick by your friend and continue biting your tongue?

"Alright, I've been here before, to this site and this depressed on life.  I have experience that would get any person out of depression and live a pretty well rounded life.  Only to be honest I sometimes choose i think to be down and out all the time.  I was in recovery from a drug problem for 2 years and i developed a relationship with a Higher Power that really really helped with my depression / anxieties / addictions.  So it would be insane for someone who knows the solution to not use it right?  Well i've heard it said before, that once someone who had great faith loses it it makes it  more difficult for that person to find hope or faith, so that's where i've been the past 2 1/2 months, hopeless.      I tried Heroin after 2 years clean.  Looking for something to shut my mind up and find some comfortable peace due to my increasing loneliness and depression.  I only got real sick for about the two weeks i was on it and lost a job and apartment.  Then i moved back with my mom who has deep anger at my dad and life i guess who is with a man that is using her in my opinion, he's in a halfway house and just lays on her couch all day.   And my dad has deep depression / bipolar on every medication you could think of and lives with his mom who only talks about ""the divorce"" and how ""i should have did this different"" So really if i look at it long enough and deep enough they're alive but dead in a healthy emotional, spiritual, mental level, so where's the encouragement or love i so long needed as a younger person, and even most importantly i need some guidance now, instead of being ashamed of who they are.  I just need to vent.  I'm 22 i just started college last week and i am extremely anxious when there, I feel as though i wear a suit, outfit, costume of misery, fear, depression, THE VOID.  So it drives others away, plus i am ashamed of being a depressive / anxious dude so keeping others away is my aim.  I mean i'm 22 i should be getting laid and having fun right?!  Man i feel so old but so immature emotionally.  I talked to a friend of mine that is at Yale in Connecticut last night who has always been a good natured, smart, artistic guy, and a person who experiences depression but doesn't let it get the best of him, and he said to not dwell in the negative like i've always done, find something through out the day that is positive, a girl smiles at you, a song whatever.

"Im a mess and I need to rant. Every so often, I'll find a glimmer of hope and try my hardest to change my life. I'll start exercising and eating healthy, and pushing myself to talk to people, and I'll actually feel pretty good for a few days. Then I just stop. I'll wake up one day and and have absolutely no desire to be healthy anymore and slip right back into feeling like shit and hating myself because I can't commit to the simplest of things. This is probably the fourth time it's happened in the past year. I made some really bad choices today regarding food, which made me feel so much worse because in my eyes, my worth as a human being is directly tied to the shape of my body. Nobody could  ever convince me that it's not.  This past bought of motivation, I tried to convince myself that I was going to exercise and eat right for the sake of my health, but in the back of my mind, I knew the only real reason was because I wanted to lose weight. And now here I am, completely abandoned diet and exercise and right back into the throws of depression. All I want to do anymore is lay in bed and try to fall asleep. I don't have a job (or the desire to have one) and I lost most of my friends because I never talked to them. I live with my mom who I thought I could talk to about anything, but I feel like I can't tell her about how bad it's gotten. It doesn't help that she tells me everyday that I need to get a job. I know she is right, but it makes me feel like an even bigger piece of garbage because I've never held down a job for more than 4 months. If I got a job right now, I'd probably have a breakdown and quit the first week.  I went through cosmetology school and put myself into debt just to wind up hating the field and trying to lie to myself that I didn't. I thought it was all about doing hair, but it turns out it's all about trying to get people to buy some shitty hair product. I know my outlook on the world is fucked up, but I don't know how to change myself. It's like all these negative thoughts are engraved in the back of my skull. I just feel like I'm stuck and any move I make is the wrong one.    Sorry this is all over the place, I'm just really deep into it right now and needed to vent.

"Hi all, I'm new to this forum and am in desperate need for help and advice as I've nowhere else to turn. I'll start at the beginning. I feel that I'm under a lot of stress with my job and the pressures of life. I feel that stress and depression go hand in hand. I'm not sure if I am stressed and depressed or if I have something medically wrong with me. That's where I need advice on what are common symptoms of depression and stress. At first I thought I was anemic as I am pale and don't eat a lot of meat so thought that my dizziness was down to lack of iron in the system. I also get eye strain but put that down to working on computers as a living. I have had blood tests for anemia, diabetes, blood sugar levels and other general tests which all came back fine. I have changed my diet and exercise more. At the moment I suffer from dizziness, eye strain, headaches, lack of concentration, irritability, lethargic and lack of co-ordination. If I'm honest I'm s***ting (Not sure if I can say that) myself as I don't understand what is wrong with me. I have a loving girlfriend and no money problems and a good social life but a stressful (if that's a word) job.

"Was this a true friendship? TL;DR (?) A friend that I have know for 15 years just blocked me on facebook. I have always had feelings for her but I had began to move on. I don't have a lot of friends and I always liked having her as a friend and as someone I could go to. She was willing to do this with me even when she was dating someone else. As she got more serious with the other guy she started to talk to me less and less and she started to not chat with me as much about her life but she always wanted to hear about my problems and woes.  I really started to feel that something was wrong when she recently got married. We had talked about marriage a few times in previous years. She had indicated that she was unsure if she would ever get married then she said she was considering it with her bf. Then one day she moved to a the same city as her husband to be but when I asked her about why or if she was considering marrying him she said she moved because she liked it there more. She hid the fact that she was engaged from me but still allowed a friendship. I know that it shouldn't have mattered that she was getting married but I did want to be supportive of it and I also wanted to know because I felt that it would be unappropriate for us to be the same type of friends that we were. One day I called her to tell her some really bad news about something that had happened in my life. I called several times but she didn't answer because she was busy. She finally returned my call at midnight and got onto me for calling her so much and then said ""I can't do this"". Then she put severe restrictions on it saying that  I could only talk to her in sever circumstances or to tell her things but she would never initiate contact with me or make small talk with me. I got fed up and told her that it wasn't true friendship if she wouldn't reciprocate communication or tell me about major things in her life getting married. I also brought up some things from the past that made me feel the way that I feel towards her. Then she blocked me on facebook and told me that she wanted to discontinue all communication altogether.   I feel like she knew that she had be wrong with me in the past but refused to admit it to me. Was this ever a true friendship? Am I wrong for feeling like my heart was torn out because of what she did? Is what she did OK from her end? Was she wrong or could she have been better about communicating this with me? I just don't know how to process what happened and I feel bad but I still feel that if I am going to call somebody a friend, I should be able to talk to them about life without limitation. I do know there are boundaries but just making small talk shouldn't violate a boundary. I am just looking for validation.  I still do care about her as a person. I don't think she's evil but I do think that she doesn't have much  compassion for me.",0,true friendship tlr friend know year just blocked facebook feeling began on not lot friend liked having friend to willing dating else got guy started talk started not chat life wanted hear problem woe really started feel wrong recently got married talked marriage time previous year indicated unsure married said considering bf day moved city husband asked considering marrying said moved liked more hid fact engaged allowed friendship know not mattered getting married did want supportive wanted know felt unappropriate type friend were day called tell really bad news happened life called time did not answer busy finally returned midnight got calling said i this severe restriction saying talk sever circumstance tell thing initiate contact make small talk me got fed told not true friendship not reciprocate communication tell major thing life getting married brought thing past feel way feel her blocked facebook told wanted discontinue communication altogether feel like knew wrong past refused admit me true friendship wrong feeling like heart torn did did ok end wrong better communicating me just not know process happened feel bad feel going somebody friend able talk life limitation know boundary just making small talk not violate boundary just looking validation care person not think evil think doe not compassion me
" My brother and I were at a mall yesterday with two of our closest friends, Carly and Jessica.  I realized something yesterday, no matter what has happened in our lives they have always been there through good and bad times.  I realized that whenever I need someone to talk to I have always been able to count on the twins to listen and to tell me their opinions.  They have always been at our house growing up, whenever school let out, they'd be over for sure. Its hard for me to think of days when they haven't been over at our house. The four of us have done practically everything together.   They are two of my true friends. I have very few friends that I could say that about.  Not many people know me as well as these gals. Now that we are getting older our lives will most likely be keeping us from seeing each other as much as we have in the past, but I know that no matter where we are we will be friends. They have meant so much to me in my life that I can't even explain to you in this one simple blog. I have tried my best to show you, but this is only a scratch of the surface of what these two mean to me. I just hope that I have been as good a friend to them as they both have been to me.

"The only thing that can happen in such a boring world is terror. Or something. Did you se the footage from Monrovia (that's in Liberia, for any Americans who might be reading this...)? I can't understand how these kids are just walking around firing their AKs as if they are hanging out after school. You don't tend to see the other side but I assume it's the same. There was a shot of a group of kids nonchalantly lounging around on the back of a pickup truck upon which was mounted an old-fashioned looking heavy machine-gun, the kind with an armored shield and mounted on a pivot, maybe a mobile anti-aircraft gun. The truck wasn't moving, the gun was in use. So why were a bunch of kids just sitting there? Don't human beings usually seek to protect themselves from danger? Why do people involved in a fire fight walk around as if they were popping out to the shops for a six pack and a box of 200 B & H? Despite 3 weeks service in the Israeli army, I have yet to experience any sort of hostile activity which goes beyond the emotional... What do you do when everything you were told turned out to be bullshit and you realize that everyone you know is deluded? I have started to experience intense rages which appear to be provoked by my girlfriend, who, it seems, thinks that the purpose of a relationship is to psychoanalyze one's partner destructively, to the point of inducing a breakdown. Or something. I have lashed out at her, hitting and screaming and have, during intense screaming matches, to beat my fists against the wall. This is the best I can do to prevent myself from smashing her to pieces. My right hand still hurts me from a couple of days ago. She closes the windows to try to spare the neighbors any unpleasantness. God knows what they must think. Like I could give a fuck. I am inconsiderate, I am selfish, I am a bastard, I have a cold attitude to others, I am a snob, I have contempt for everyone. I don't know which is my stuff and which is hers. I am thinking more of suicide these days. I used to have the regular teenage fascination with my mortality and the potential termination thereof. We were going to try for a baby but she has a hormonal condition which seems quite serious. I have to go wank in a jar and see if my tadpoles are doing whatever it is they should do. She wants me to consider going off with another woman to procreate if it turns out she is infertile. This fills me with rage. I will not tell you why. If you don't understand this you don't understand. What does anyone understand? Is life ever going to change? I am starting to suffer from a new sort of depression. I am starting to feel like I am 31 and the old passion is really not there anymore. Everything is hopeless but it can't ever change. I want to hurt myself and have a fantasy to kill myself with my Leatherman.

"A letter to a person I let down To The Person I Miss The Most,  Happy birthday man, I miss you and I’m sorry. It feels like so much time has gone by that any attempt at reconciliation would do more harm than anything else at this point. We used to have so much fun, but nostalgia only makes everyone feel worse, and more often than not leads to poor choices. It’s a sweet substance, like sugar, just with a punch in the gut to remind you that you can’t ever go back to something you once valued so highly.  	 It’s been a year and a couple months since we’ve talked, and there’s rarely a day where you don’t cross my mind. I’m not saying that’s healthy, because it sure as hell isn’t, but who cares anyways. 	 I wasn’t good for you, you were too good for me, we crashed and burned and I loved every second of it. Was it worth it? Maybe. Does that matter? Not in the slightest.  Now I just sit alone in the dark writing you letters that I know you’ll never fuckin’ read, pretending in my head that there’s some fucking way that i can salvage the situation. It’s like watching someone stand at the bottom of the pool drowning, when all they have to do is swim to the surface.  I’m cold, and tired, wasting time and throwing away opportunities left and right because i have no idea what I’m doing, and I know that you’re doing well, that makes me happy. You deserve to succeed.  	 You’ve been to hell and back, and I might as well have been the chauffeur for a good portion of it.   I loved you, I don’t think I do anymore, but I know I did. I thought about comparing how I felt about you with a bunch of shitty metaphors but let’s be honest, that isn’t our style. We’d probably laugh at how cheesy it was and how stupid this whole situation is and then we’d pull out our guitars and write a beautiful sad duet and I’d be out of tune while you hit every note perfectly. But you wouldn’t critique me, that’s just the way you are.   Too kind, and sweet, too good to everyone you came across even though you knew there was a pretty good chance that they’d never return the favor. And man I really tried to, all those times we walked around talking about how much we wanted to die and how sad we were, but the whole thing was build on the back of our own loneliness and sadness.   But that’s the past. Nostalgia is bullshit, but I have to indulge once in awhile just to feel something, I’m sure you remember that. Here’s to better times ahead, and a letter left unread. Sincerely, Your Old Best Friend ",1,letter person let person miss most happy birthday man miss sorry feel like time gone attempt reconciliation harm point used fun nostalgia make feel worse not lead poor choice sweet substance like sugar just punch gut remind valued highly year couple month talked rarely day not cross mind not saying healthy sure hell not care anyways not good you good me crashed burned loved second it worth it maybe doe matter not slightest just sit dark writing letter know fuckin read pretending head fucking way salvage situation like watching stand pool drowning swim surface cold tired wasting time throwing away opportunity left right idea doing know doing well make happy deserve succeed hell back chauffeur good portion it loved you not think anymore know did thought comparing felt bunch shitty metaphor let honest not style probably laugh cheesy stupid situation pull guitar write beautiful sad duet tune hit note perfectly not critique me just way are kind sweet good came knew pretty good chance return favor man really tried to time walked talking wanted die sad were thing build loneliness sadness past nostalgia bullshit indulge awhile just feel something sure remember that better time ahead letter left unread sincerely old best friend

"How to cope with disrespectful and lying friend? HI I'm new to reddit so please bear with me  So this is the situation:  My friend and I often interact while playing online games as we're both huge nerds and gamers. I really enjoy spending time with her. However she has this other friend that I really dislike and I would rather play alone than put up with interacting with her friend. I have on multiple occasions expressed my discomfort with her friend and she has acknowledged it but would still invite him anyways without asking me. When that happens I usually just say sorry I don't feel like playing. Sorry for being difficult. She knows her friend will repel me. So anyways after sometime I asked if I can request not to invite him when I'm playing with her and would understand if she said no cause I realize it's a selfish request. She said it's ok no problem. So then we proceed to our routine and there's no issue whatsoever. I told her if it's too difficult to say no or your friend keeps bugging you about it I can go as I didn't want to make it difficult with my own selfishness.   The problem a rise when she invited a mystery friend with different name. I suspected and knew that it was her friend that I disliked so immediately asked who that was and she said it's just a random. Not happy with her lying I went off to calm down and confronted her about it, trying to be as clear and straight to the point as I can. I expressed that what she did was hurtful and disrespectful in my point of view. I told her I'm not pleased at the fact she lied even when I called her out. So I said it's on her to resolve this issue. She replied saying there is no issue and what she did was fine. Saying it wasn't disrespectful and its not a big lie plus it was to see if I would even notice its her friend. Long story short she said if it was her she wouldn't be angry cause she's a grown up and that I'm being immature and childish by blowing things out of proportion over such joke-trivial matter.   So this is more or less the situation and at the moment it's not good. As she thinks I'm in the wrong and she's right. I have considered the fact that I am wrong and have asked for an outside opinion but all my friends are just angry at how she's treating me.   I understand that she can be friends with and spend time with whoever she wants. It's her life afterall. I'm not making her choose cause I know it's selfish and wrong so I'm choosing to remove myself in that situation as it's the only thing to do besides putting up with her friend. My problem is the fact that she attempted to trick me to play together with her friend and continue lying about it upon confrontation. Also by doing so I feel disrespected as she completely disregarded my feelings and opinion in the matter. I would have been perfectly fine if she told me at the start her friend wants to play and she can't really say no or she wants to play with him etc etc. In that case I'll just make myself scarce which I have no issue on doing. Instead she resorted to being deceitful with something so simple and dumb. There's quite a lot more so I'll probably update this but this is in essence more of less the situation.

"I have been on antidepressants for probably 10 years now. I was on Serzone which worked very well. My husband and I decided to get pregnant so I had to stop it. I have now been on Zoloft, Effexor and Celexa. I am currently taking 40mg Celexa (generic) and 75 mg Effexor. What I'm wondering is- are hot flashes normal with antidepressants? I don't remember having them on Serzone but I have had them since I started Zoloft. I'm not sure if this is from the medications or pregnancy and nursing?

"Desperate for advice or input; I lost and am losing everything held dear to me right now due to multiple reasons, and would just like to hear some different recommendations I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DONT KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG OR HOW TO FEEL BETTER!!  I've typed this out way too many times so I'm gonna do my best to sum it up as short as I can:  Last week me and my gf of 10 and a half months broke up, i was devestated. In that little time I have experienced more love, more of life than ever before and it felt like we'd been together forever. I thought, maybe we would work things out on our own and get back together when the time was right, even though i knew it was a stretch, but i was also okay with just being friends if that was what the world had planned. 2 days after the break up im talking to both of my best friends who are also (kinda?) friends with her, and they both tell me that she basically told them she had absolutely no intention of ever getting back with me because she wanted to ho around without the commitment of a relationship. She also openly bragged to one of them that she had cheated on me multiple times during our relationship. This all made me very angry and on top of that hurt. The same night just after finding all of this out I find out from my other friend that she had called her and bragged about hooking up with this one kid who, during our entire relationship, she told me she hated and that we BOTH already had bad history with, and fooled around. Then later (AGAIN) she goes on instagram live with my bestfriend who is kinda being fake just to see how she really is and openly brags about blocking me (which added to the hurt cause i had done nothing but try to respect her wishes since the split in hopes that we could at least part on good terms ya know) , saying that i was 'fucking crazy' and that she never wanted anything to do with me ever again. There's more in terms of details but thats the basic general idea of the past week for me.  I dont know how i feel or what to say. I feel hurt and i feel abandoned and i feel stupid and i feel not good enough and i feel like a complete fuck up i feel so fucking awful its not even funny. Im losing my friends because my stupid brain cant get over this and im constantly going to them to talk about it because that's the way i like to deal with stuff, but they've heard the same thing one too many times and i get that i just dont know what else to do. Im tired of thinking about it, im tired of not being able to confront her but my friends say its not a good idea because its not gonna do anything but make her think even higher of herself for having fucked me up so badly and wont at all make her change her ways. I want to completely forget but at the same time a part of me wants to work everything out just so i can mean something to this person who meant absolutely everything to me at one point again, WHY??  Why does my brain, or heart, or whatever still crave attention from her, or maybe even her herself, even after knowing all of this? Why am i so fucking pathetic? What can I do to move on that doesn't involve just ignoring the problem and moving forward but rather coming to peace with it and myself and blossoming?  Please, all and every opinion or suggestion is welcome. Thank you if you took the time to read this and I wish everybody the best of luck with your own problems no matter what they be.

"Get myself to be more active/alive? So, my depression is getting worse and worse since a few years. I'm in law school and I'm in the last year of preparation - in our country, this is THE BUSIEST TIME ever for those students - like, they start studying at 7 in the morning at stay until 11 in the night at the library. nonstop studying for 1-1,5 years in preparation for the big exams.  I started last october. it's july. I have maybe studied on two or three days, seriously. the other time, I just sit at home, in a kind of weird freeze. I'm BORED out of my mind, my brain is longing for some activity, and I actually really want to be all busy and studying and feel like I have a purpose. It's like I know exactly how important it is now, and my brain is screaming at me to get my books out and start doing what I want to do.  But I just sit here. Heck, if I'm procrastinating so bad, at least I could have fun, party, travel, meet people, see the world, at least not waste my time or waste it in a way that's at least fun! But I'm still sitting here. Like in a shock. It feels like it's too late for the studying thing (exams are in spring and I have no idea about the subjects and skip all classes I'm paying for) and I have no idea what else to do with my time.  It doesn't help that over the last two years, I kinda developed an eating disorder with anorexic, bulimic and binge-eating-tendencies that also made my health decline. I'm constantly thinking about numbers, looking up nutritional infos, reading medical studies, looking at food online - it's taking so much space in my head although I'm quite 'close to my goal', and I shouldn't even worry because if I keep doing what I planned (restrict for another 4-5 weeks, then slowly up my calories until I no longer lose weight, stay at maintenance and start to slowly incorporate exercise to finally be healthy, eating healthy, and exercising to maintain good health), there's no reason to be so occupied with this topic.  Any idea how to get myself to get up and DO SOMETHING? The sitting around is what is probably making me most depressed, because I watch my life burn down and kind of can't do anything about.   PLEASE don't suggest to get professional help. I know, it's the most rational thing, especially for the eating thing, but right now, I just can't, I really can't :(",1,activealive so depression getting worse worse year law school year preparation country busiest time student like start studying morning stay night library nonstop studying year preparation big exam started october july maybe studied day seriously time just sit home kind weird freeze bored mind brain longing activity actually really want busy studying feel like purpose like know exactly important now brain screaming book start doing want do just sit here heck procrastinating bad fun party travel meet people world not waste time waste way fun sitting here like shock feel like late studying thing exam spring idea subject skip class paying for idea time doe not help year kinda developed eating disorder anorexic bulimic bingeeatingtendencies health decline constantly thinking number looking nutritional info reading medical study looking food online taking space head quite close goal not worry doing planned restrict week slowly calorie longer lose weight stay maintenance start slowly incorporate exercise finally healthy eating healthy exercising maintain good health reason occupied topic idea something sitting probably making depressed watch life burn kind about not suggest professional help know rational thing especially eating thing right now just cannot really
"Shoudl I just stop being friends with this guy? I made a post on this subreddit a couple days ago. I thought that all my friends disliked me because I am mean to them, but for a solid 2-3 days I was the nicest I had been to anyone for what I remember, I asked all my friends how their days were, bought them food, listened to them. And it worked, they all are my very good friends now, but there is just one problem, the person who I considered my BEST friend is being a dick. Once I get attached to someone it’s hard for me to let go. For example, in my previous relationship, I hated my gf, and I hated being with her, talking to her, I found her annoying, I never broke up with her, then, one day she decidedI was neglecting her so she said she wanted to break up, I begged her to stay even though I hated everything about her. We still end up breaking up, afterwards I was soo happy. Now, this person who I considered to be my BEST friend makes fun of me all the time for getting dumped by a girl and saying “you got left by an ugly girl for a gay guy.” This sentence aline can tell you about his personality and how bad of a person he is. Today, my scho went to a ski park, I enjoyed my day, had fun, everythkng was fine. On the bus ride back to school, I was talking to my so called “best friend.” He randomly went up to a girl I didn’t know and told her I liked her, she then said “I don’t care.” I don’t know if this was a rejection or just a simple “I don’t care” but I didn’t really care because I didn’t find her attractive at all. I laugh it off and end up saying the word “nigga.” Now, I am what you would call a mulatto. I am bi-racial, half black, half white. After I said this word, a girl sitting behind me called me a racist. I then say that i’m half black and she says “I know.” This was embarrassing, I get made fun of a lot because of the tone of my skin and my ethnicity, it’s one if the things that still get to me. Moving on, he proceeds to point at me and laugh, then, scream at me saying I got rejected by the girl I didn’t even like or ask out. I stood up on the bus and accidentally touched a girl’s tit, she got very mad and I apologized but you could tell she was still mad. We get to school and he starts pushing me into doors and lockers, he is much bigger than me and I couldn’t really push him back easily. The day ends then we take the bus back home, me and this kid are on the same bus and he says, “you’re gross, nobody likes you and you got rejected by the ugliest girl in school. That’s why you got dumped by an ugly bitch.” And he walked away, as i’m walking home, I was talking to some friends and they treat me like a fucking human, they were nice, didn’t insult me, and treated me nicely. I got home and here I an, what should I do, he has managed to get the whole school to believe I am a perv, racist, ugly, nobody. It’s actually funny, he was the first person to ever talk to me, he was nice to me but after a while it just turned out he was a bad person, I wish one of the other guys were first to approach me, i’d have much better friends. What do I do, it’s one one of the hardest things to dispel gossip, everybody thought I was gay when I first came to the school, I got a girlfriend, suspicion gone, but how am I gunna disprove im not racist, not a perv, and how the hell am I supposed to deal with this “friend” if mine?",0,shoudl just stop friend guy post subreddit couple day ago thought friend disliked mean them solid day nicest remember asked friend day were bought food listened them worked good friend now just problem person considered best friend dick attached hard let go example previous relationship hated gf hated her talking her annoying broke her then day decidedi neglecting said wanted break up begged stay hated her end breaking up soo happy now person considered best friend make fun time getting dumped girl saying got left ugly girl gay guy sentence aline tell personality bad person is today scho went ski park enjoyed day fun everythkng fine bus ride school talking called best friend randomly went girl did not know told liked her said not care not know rejection just simple not care did not really care did not attractive all laugh end saying word nigga now mulatto biracial half black half white said word girl sitting called racist say half black say know embarrassing fun lot tone skin ethnicity thing me moving on proceeds point laugh then scream saying got rejected girl did not like ask out stood bus accidentally touched girl tit got mad apologized tell mad school start pushing door locker bigger not really push easily day end bus home kid bus say gross like got rejected ugliest girl school got dumped ugly bitch walked away walking home talking friend treat like fucking human nice did not insult me treated nicely got home an do managed school believe perv racist ugly nobody actually funny person talk me nice just turned bad person wish guy approach me better friend do hardest thing dispel gossip everybody thought gay came school got girlfriend suspicion gone gunna disprove im not racist not perv hell supposed deal friend mine

"Best moment to have anxiety It's 3:30am, I'm tired, want to get up early, and guess what ? My brain decided this : Instead of sleeping, why don't you become half crazy, thinking about your future (should I say the ""lack"" of future ?). Here, have some cravings for cigarettes, my pleasure, and of course i know you don't have cigarettes, do you think I'm stupid ? The middle of the night is the best moment for thinking of smoking when you can't smoke.  Think of your loneliness. Think of you inexistant social life. You are 25 and you have no job. You are living with your boring mother, with whom you literally quarel with every day. She probably think you are a piece of shit. You never had any girlfriend, and you probably won't. Almost 26, don't count on me to congratulate you...  Your only sunbeam will be at New year's Eve, when you will travel to see your best friends. But guess what, since you have no money at all, you probably will have to work to sell fu***ng pastries, and because of that you won't be able to see your friends.  Then you'll continue to argue with your mother. Living on the couch. Selling pastries. In entire loneliness. God only knows how long.  The funny thing (say my brain) is this : ""you are a loser, you lived and worked on your own not so long ago. But you are a child, you have the power to do what you want, where you want. You're 25, for God's sake, so why don't you move your ass ?""  Leave me alone brain, I already know all that. I would be a king if I could. But I won't. Funny how despair can suck the marrow of your life, how even when you are ready to fall in the deepest pit, you have absolutely no will to catch the rope.  TL ; DR : FML.  Have a good day/night everyone !

" France and the Allies celebrated last week end one of the most fantastic military operations ever made in the world. Never so much depended on so few courageous soldiers wo sacrified to free a continent they didn't know. I'm 26 and i knom i'm living in a free land thanks to brave young men who fought for what they believe to be right. I will always love this America but i can help thinking that today America is on the wrong way. America's grief is justified, America is right to launch attacks against a faceless ennemy who wants to burn the whole world but this fight can be boiled down to a fight between evil and good, to a crusade against barbarians, it will be dangerous and counterproductive. Europe knows how complex is the world, europe knows how high is the price of blood and Europe doesn't want to be part of the wrong war. The United States are our closest friends and friends don't have to agree on everything. On the contrary, i will be happy if my friends tell me that i'm about to make a huge mistakes, that i act like a fool.

" This weekend went by fast, even though it was lacking in things to do. Despite the budsmoke it was a kinda sucky weekend. I dunno...I haven't been going out with Sarah long and I don't know her very well, but I feel like its always gonna stay that way. We never seem to spend more than a half an hour--tops together and theres never any conversation. I wish we could talk or see each other but maybe shes just too busy...Guess I'll just have to wait for that one day when I call shes home or she calls me to see her...that one day...somewhere down the road. I came home early tonight to do some make-up work and Im glad to say I at least got some done so hopefully I can pass grammer, I don't know about ICA though those essays seem to be amongst the missing.

"Might have gotten my friend fired at work First of all: hello!   I’m just gonna jump right in. So I (23/f) have been best friends with this girl (let’s call her maya) for about 3 1/2 Years now. Another girl (we will go with Ashley) became part of our group about a year later and maya asked us to start working at the restaurant she served at part time.  Eventually, maya started a thing with this guy who was in a relationship at the time, so we obviously didn’t really put a lot of hope into the whole thing. But eventually he broke up with the other girl to be with maya. Now she started really getting into weed (like 3 blunts a day all by herself) and then dropping pills on the weekends. Ashley and I are not into it so we stayed away but tried to still hang out but it got more and more difficult being with her because she either a) fell asleep b) throw up all the time c) was just super uncomfortable to be around.  Also work got fucking disastrous because she asked us to pick her up and every single time she either overslept or just forgot about it... so we were always late with her.  Last week it really excalated: she left Ashley hanging for over an hour, didn’t pick up her phone, I cancelled all my plans to go to work instead of maya and or coworker was all by himself with a huge group of guests. And all she did was send us a voice mail telling us what we should tell our boss. (Not even a reason why all of it happened) Obviously, we were both really pissed and I just told our superior what had happened and why I was there instead of her. Needless to say he was mad and said that our boss has to talk to her about this because it obviously just a big no go.  The issue is, she kind of expected us to lie for her and I don’t think I can deal with that anymore. She has become so enstranged lately and I don’t want to support her selfish and self-destructive behaviour. But now I guess I might have made her lose her job and i don’t know if I should apologise and try to talk our boss into letting her stay or just accept that she’ll hate me forever and go on with my life.  I’ve told her that I don’t like the whole drug thing but she laughed it off, called me a coward and sheltered. But she also treats me (and Ashley to an extend) like her servants and all my other friends can’t stand to be around her.  So really, i don’t know how to approach her with the whole situation because in the end I’m going to be the horrible friend that ruined her life. Should I apologise or/and try to damage control the whole thing at work?   TLDR: friend has drug problem and left all of us hanging at work again so i didn’t play along with the hundredth shitty excuse She wanted us to tell ",0,gotten friend fired work all hello just gonna jump right in f best friend girl let maya year now girl we ashley group year later maya asked start working restaurant served time eventually maya started thing guy relationship time obviously did not really lot hope thing eventually broke girl maya started really getting weed like blunts day herself dropping pill weekend ashley not stayed away tried hang got difficult a fell asleep b throw time c just super uncomfortable around work got fucking disastrous asked pick single time overslept just forgot it late her week really excalated left ashley hanging hour did not pick phone cancelled plan work instead maya coworker huge group guest did send voice mail telling tell bos not reason happened obviously really pissed just told superior happened instead her needle say mad said bos talk obviously just big go issue is kind expected lie not think deal anymore enstranged lately not want support selfish selfdestructive behaviour guess lose job not know apologise try talk bos letting stay just accept hate forever life told not like drug thing laughed off called coward sheltered treat and ashley extend like servant friend stand her really not know approach situation end going horrible friend ruined life apologise orand try damage control thing work tldr friend drug problem left hanging work did not play hundredth shitty excuse wanted tell

"It feels like my friend doesn't care about me and is rubbing it in my face So the only best friend I had planned out for weeks how she was going to do something behind my back then brag about it to me and make up stuff about what happened to make me jealous. I immediately found out that she was making stuff about it up but that kinda just made it worse. It still bothers me a lot even though it happened in July and it's still making me depressed. I sort of stopped talking to her for a few weeks but then when I felt like I could I refollowed her posts on facebook and nearly every single post is like ""I love my new best friend more than anyone else"" not even exaggerating. I tried to ignore it but there were just constant posts like that I just can't look at anything she posts anymore because some how it makes me more depressed and lowers my self image even more though it's already at zero. Should I just completely move on? I feel like never talking to her again is my only option.

"I just really need to vent... For a start, I understand everyone in life are at different levels and that depression and anxiety is different for everyone and I am in no way stating who has it worst or better. I’ve taken hours and hours of training in it and I’m not here to speak or preach about how to help.. In a rare occasion in my life I’m asking for help, guidance, I don’t know the correct word but maybe if I explain myself a bit it may help. This maybe long and I do apologize but I just need to say all of this SOMEWHERE...   I’m gay guy that recently moved from a conservative town in Montana to the amazing city of Portland, OR. I came out of the closet the summer going into my freshman year of high school, dealt with a (simply put) shitty childhood while growing up in the Bible Belt of northern Florida, with an abusive father and worrying, even at the age of 7/8 about how my future would play out in this. My mom divorced and remarried a man that doesn’t accept my sexuality personally but supports my life decision  and says he loves me. We moved to Montana (my mom, me and him) and I began to feel like I did have a purpose when I was introduced to acting onstage at a local theatre that I fell in love with. Life, for a few years, was amazing but my high school at the time was having a crisis. Unfortunately four students had committed suicide between my freshman and junior year and, with the help of many, started a suicide awareness program in the city and lead that for a year or so. My senior year, literally three days before it started, my military brother committed suicide on base, it was suspected it was also his sexuality. But also in my senior year, near the end of it, I met a man whom I fell in love with (which is what I am getting too, just bare with me). We were able to spend a lot of time together for a month or two before he had to leave to Portland (before I had gone) for a work internship where he would go back home to Brazil once completed. He treats me like gold, and I really mean that, he has been nothing but amazing to me. He flew me out to Portland so I could visit him for two weeks where we fell even more in love. Everything was shattered when he left for home and I also left for an adventure.   After I graduated, I had the amazing opportunity to go to the BEAUTIFUL island of Taiwan, where I spent an amazing year learning Chinese (Mandarin), meeting people all around the world, experiencing a new culture for the first time, it was indeed a life changing time for me. But it wasn’t easy for my boyfriend and I. We fought in occasion, texting makes it really hard to communicate emotions, and we only had about two hours out of our days to talk due to the harsh time zone differences. The year went by quite quickly and he surprised me with yet another plane ticket to Portland where he would also land only two hours after I did and we would be together again. It was only for two weeks again but I felt complete... He even proposed on the Fourth of July. He was yanked away from me again soon after and it tore me down. My heart crumbled.  My next chapter in life had started once I arrived back from Taiwan and had seen my boyfriend again. I had decided I wanted to move to a Portland permanently, found a decent student housing apartment, enrolled for school, I was excited... now this is where things become a bit much for me and why I’m here today.   My, now fiancé, was able to stay with me for a full month this time. Now at this point I’m sure you wonder (if you are still reading), “why doesn’t he move here?,” or “why don’t you move there?”  Here’s why: He was on an exchange program when I met him that the Brazilian government paid for. The requirement for that visa is that he must stay in Brazil for two years before he can legally move back into the USA. In other words, he is stuck there while I’m stuck here both separated and both in fear of him being rejected. We applied for the fiancé visa and now we are waiting for the approval. I refuse to move where he lives because of how high the crime rate is and due to Brazil’s economic status, we both agreed it would not be good for a white American target to live in a high crime area.   I know I have talked a lot about my fiancé but here is also what is going on on my hands as well that I just was not ready for. Before I moved to Portland, I had to go to urgent care because I had no primary doctor and no money, only Medicaid, which they took. I went three times for small bumps on my hands that turned out to be stressed induced and all three times I went the doctors said “I have no idea! Try using lotions and see what happens!” Nodded their heads and left. Very pointless but when I got the bill I was shocked and confused. I thought my Medicaid had covered it, which it did not because while I was out of country my Medicaid had expired and no one told me about it, therefore I was left with a $600 bill. I heard it off for a while because I had other things to deal with than the bullshit that the hospital was giving me about it. Around this time as well, I moved in with my best friend due to a dispute I had with my parents, which really crumbled me, but they still don’t know how upset I am about it.   I moved to Portland... and now I believe I’m regretting it...   I moved with that same best friend where we would also share the space with two others, a couple from Hawaii. We had Skyped then ahead of time in our excitement of moving and we were all excited to meet each other. I had a job lined up for me as a barista, I had a savings plan lined up for what I could and couldn’t spend for money, school would be starting soon, things were looking pretty nice!   Well... it’s not nice. Not nice at all.   The Hawaiian couple does not like my friend and I. They stop our oven mittens and tried to say they were there’s and hid them from us, refused to let us use the garbage can in the kitchen, and held little meetings about what it is we were doing wrong and how we could fix it.. I was so thrown back I ignore them at any chance and even had to take time out of my life to tell them how upsetting it is we had reached a level where they had to actually put sticky notes on things we could touch and could not touch. I find myself to be quite tidy and clean and fair but I guess there are two sides of the story always.   That’s the first thing.   That job I had lined up as a barista? Big joke... I met with the boss who said the store isn’t open yet and asked if I wanted to be a cashier for the university instead. I said why not, the pay was amazing at $12.75 an hour and had benefits. I did my on-boarding and was quite interested. First day on the job however they lied and put me in food service where I was demanded around by two chefs and four managers who didn’t know what the fuck they were doing. One of the chef’s actually spilt boiling grease on my foot and didn’t even apologize. The other chef was racist and talked bad about the Indian workers so much I had to leave his presence. It was a toxic environment. Income tax in Oregon was so high I wasn’t able to afford my apartment and realized I need to be working minimum wage to sincerely support myself here. I left after a month and am now struggling on finding a full time again. On a side note, because of costs and issues with finding a co-signed for a loan, I had to pull my enrollment for school as well.  That’s the second..   When my fiancé came to visit me for a month, my best friend/roommate was very difficult... it’s a harsh word to use but she has a lot of learning to do. I have been on my own since I was 16 in doing things myself (with the exception of paying my phone bill and buying a car). Taxes, jobs, appointments, etc., were all me. She needs some help getting there and she has done and amazing job to get there but... every opportunity I hand her to take one more step of becoming independent she rejects and shuts down completely. The whole month was very hard for my fiancé and I over how jealous and upset she got and it was too much. Currently she is back home for Christmas and I am alone and quite frankly I needed it. I just don’t know how to handle that situation. It was as if she was using her emotions against me and it was poisonous. It go so bad my fiancé and Igor an Airbnb our last two nights together so it could just be me and him.   That’s the third..  I had to go to the emergency room as well when my fiancé was here due to yet another kidney stone. I got one in the 7th grade, near the end of my exchange program and one in a restaurant where the pain was so bad I needed to call an ambulance... more money on shit I can’t afford.   I can go on and on with these stories but I need to get to this... it’s my anxiety. I was diagnosed with depression in high school but was taken off of medication. I was doing actually quite well! But most recently, with everything that’s been going on, it’s gotten really really bad. I am constantly anxed about everything.. when I walk down the street, I fear what people look at me as. Now I’m not fat, I’d say I’m average but my cheeks are so puffy and it really embarrasses me to even look in a mirror. I am constantly wondering why my fiancé wants to be with me, if he is cheating on me, lied to me, etc. I over stress about the smallest smallest things. Example: I cried and broke down because I failed my drivers test for the Oregon license. I physically felt like I was going to die or the end of the world was happening... why? Why was that happening to me? Why is this ALL happening to me? I miss my fiancé, I can’t get stable, I now starting out as an adult isn’t supposed to be easy but guys... this is really hard. I spend any day I have off in bed and I have only had one meal within two days. I know I need help but I don’t have the money for it or the time. I have never felt this insecure about my life, future, body, everything. I feel like I’m climbing up an escalator that’s going the wrong way, and no amount of running will get me to the top.   I don’t know where else to go or who to talk to. I feel like I’ve annoyed everyone already enough about me that I no longer want to talk to literally anyone. My fiancé sometimes even.   Well if you’ve made it this far I thank you sincerely... I just really needed to vent.

"School failure I think I'm doing something wrong. I found myself in a situation where I was lucky to move to prosperous country. Except I'm 27 with no degree, no proper work experience, just some odd jobs. I'm an embarrassment compared to other immigrants. Last year I began studying for the first time since high school , just to realize the field does not interest me. I barely even understand the language. My GPA is horrible. And I can't change schools for at least another 2 years due to family. I can't even get a job because my town has almost none, and the ones it does have are given to the natives (I'm foreign). The welfare covers my expenses for now but this is not a life I want to live.  I'm also anti-social and seem to fit the symptoms of ADHD, but my therapist claims it's just anxiety disorder and doesn't wanna prescribe any meds yet.  I do have a serious learning struggle even when language is not an issue, I can't seem to grasp the concepts unless teachers spell it out for me. Basically I'm unable to learn anything the moment it goes past the basics and it's rather depressing.",1,school failure think doing wrong situation lucky prosperous country degree proper work experience just odd job embarrassment compared immigrant year began studying time high school just realize field doe not me barely understand language gpa horrible change school year family job town none one doe given native i foreign welfare cover expense not life want live antisocial fit symptom adhd therapist claim just anxiety disorder doe not wanna prescribe med yet learning struggle language not issue grasp concept unless teacher spell me basically unable learn moment go past basic depressing
"Doing things that I like reminds me why I don't enjoy doing them anymore. Playing your favorite game? You shouldn't. Remember the time you shut yourself in just to play it endlessly? When nothing else mattered but your game?  Finished reading a cool book? Are you going to pick up another one and get sucked in again? Don't forget your friends.  Why would you hang out with your friends when they are tired of your negative attitude? Faking a positive attitude is worse. If you're going to be yourself just stay home.  Oh you got selected for a great job opportunity? Wait until they realize you're garbage at your job.   You have time to relax now? Think again. There's always someone needing something or things that need to be done.   Trying to treat yourself? Wait until you see the consequences from buying too many things or eating too much or wasting time.  You're actually being responsible and starting work early? Wait until you feel like nothing is worth it anymore.   Why does it matter to do things you like if you're just going to feel bad anyways?

"Whats the point anymore with love After nearly a year of struggling to stay happy from what happened between my ex and I and trying not to do relationships anymore, i let myself slip and gave myself a chance with this one girl who is amazing and nice and kind and such just to be thrown away after one fucken week. We work together and she liked me alot but since im a manager and shes an employee, we had to keep it a secret but people were already starting to spread rumors about us and my GM who wasntnearly as suspicious about it cut her hours and days for this week and i asked why. His response was that she was flirting with alot of other guys and it was becoming a problem so he cut her days to just 1 this week. When she saw the schedule she thought about us and how it was a bad idea to date and it wouldnt be a good idea anymore since she doesnt want to lose her job. Exactly one week of dating and I already lost someone that i didnt want to go away just like that. Like yeah im a bit sad but not enough to cry or anything but it just like, i was so fucken happy again i started to smile, something i havent done in months and it just felt nice but now im back to my depressed state of being lonely as usual and just play games, work and goto sleep and repeat that day after day until i end it all. This is why i try my best not to date or get attached to anyone because if i try to date, it will just end badly for me.

"Need advice on a friendship! Need advice on a friendship!So I’ve written on here a few times about this crush I had on this straight guy I worked with at work for a little over 6 months or so. To summarize it, in those short months or so we became friends I guess u can say. We both are a year apart, he likes sports, music, and video games, etc. Anyways I developed a crush on him and I couldn’t handle the fact it would never happen, so I said to myself to try and make this friendship something memorable. We hung out 3 times outside of work, the third time was kind of quick but it was still outside of work and it happened last Friday, which I loved not only was I trying to catch up with him since we hadn’t hung out since December and it’s already March. So to put in perspective, I know it’s long but bear with me, it seems like our friendship is awkward at time, there’s long silences in between, don’t really have much to say. I mean for me it’s hard already hard enough for me to engage in a long convo, I’m sort of shy but I’m trying to break out of it, and don’t really have much to say, it sucks because I feel like I’m ruining a friendship that could be great. He kind of has the same personality when I’m with him. I don’t really have many friends well because they’ve all have been assholes to me, so I really don’t have many people to talk to when I want to. So what do u guys of my friendship with this guy? Is it me or do u think it’s complicacted? Just another one I don’t I ever receive text messages from him saying what’s up or checking up on me. Now take for granted he might have a lot of friends so idk.

Most likely I'm reading too much into things but idk how to change my way of thinking. I dwell on them. I can't let them go. I can sulk for weeks on what a regular person would forget in an hour.

Well I bought the TENS machine. got it set up earlier and decided I was in SO much pain across my shoulders that I would set it at the neck shoulder setting and on the MOST intense setting due to the pain and the desperation I was feeling. Well that was a mistake it's like being stabbed with a pointy stick - so I reset it to the minimum setting. it has helped a little perhaps I should use it more often to a) get used to the feeling b) get rid of the pain as I am in LESS pain now but it hasn't gone altogether would I recommend one let's just say I need a few more days to decide but for now I am in slightly less pain than I was,1,bought ten machine got set earlier decided pain shoulder set neck shoulder setting intense setting pain desperation feeling mistake like stabbed pointy stick reset minimum setting helped little use a used feeling b rid pain pain not gone altogether recommend let just say need day decide slightly pain
"I don't particularly want to go into details about how I've been feeling the past couple of years, only because it's too much for me to go into, and I don't want to leave out important details or anything. In September 2005, I voluntarily admitted myself to the hospital's psych ward through my psychiatrist, the reason being because my depression had grown so severe that my muscles gave out and I couldn't move anymore, and my will to live had vanished entirely, I stopped eating, I was dehydrated, I stopped going to school, all I did was lay in bed all day, it's the only thing I could do. The decision to go to the hospital turned out to be a very, very big mistake, and I regret making that choice. I felt no connection with the other kids there, especially because I was a week away from turning eighteen, and most of them were thirteen, fourteen, and maybe one or two sixteen year olds. We were similar in an emotional aspect, but otherwise I couldn't relate to any of them. I just bored them, and the way they talked and the things they talked about just confused me. I did get involved with them to an extent during the last couple of days there, but I regret that now. This is a story in itself, but I also got involved with a girl there. She fell in love with me, and so did I fall in love with her, briefly. Only because a girl had never shown any attraction to me before, nor did a girl ever show any interest in me like she did. My feelings for her quickly faded after talking to her a couple of times outside the hospital. She turned out to be a real mess of a person. I did not suffer from the relationship, though. I do not talk to her anymore, and I actually became a better person because of it - I was enlightened. My depression practically disappeared following my discharge from the hospital. I don't know if it was because of the Zoloft that I had begun taking, or because I was finally free from that prison. By the way, I do have a form of claustrophobia. I am not particularly afraid of being in narrow or tight spaces... I am afraid of being locked in narrow or tight spaces. And the hospital was very small, and they did not let you leave or go where you wanted. You were confined to your room, the main recreation room, and the hallway connecting those two places. The day before I was discharged, I was constantly shaking, sweating, and going to the bathroom. I couldn't sleep, and I was afraid to move. I had to stay in my room most of the time and skip out on the group sessions. So anyway, even though I felt better right after getting out of the hospital, that quickly, VERY quickly changed. By mid-late October, I was on home-schooling (and will be until I graduate in June this year, I am a Senior in High School), and attending group therapy several days a week, as well as seeing a psychologist once a week and a psychiatrist every several weeks. All of this therapy did NOT help me. I was feeling extremely depressed and suicidal one night, after a brief fight with my dad (I accidentally bumped the curb while parking, he yelled at me to watch the curb, and I got very upset, pulled the parking break, and walked off while screaming about slitting my throat...), and called one of the therapists at my group therapy to help me. I'd locked myself in a room in my grandmother's basement, and I had called her so she could talk with me and help me to relax. Instead, she threatened to call the police if I didn't open the door and let my dad in. So I opened it, but after that I completely lost my trust in her and couldn't stand being around her anymore. Another counselor at the group therapy also lost my trust. I felt a connection with him, and trusted him a lot, so I told him about my girlfriend (whom I had met online - another story) and he kept on accusing me of things... like using her for sex, or not really being in love, and etcetera. So after having lost trust in two therapists, and then all sorts of insurance problems came up. I stopped going. A few weeks ago, I stopped going to my psychologist as well. I felt like I was being lectured by him instead of actually helped... On top of that, he was taking weekly co-pay from me while he knew my insurance did not require co-pay for anything psychological! (i.e. Counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc.) And he still owes me a couple hundred bucks. He also charged my insurance for appointments I had cancelled. Basically, I took two steps forward, and then three steps back. My depression is not as bad as it was in September 2004, but I am pretty much tired of living. I am constantly thinking of suicide, and have even written brief suicide notes and made plans (which I never carried out). My Zoloft has been at 150mg for the past couple of months. It's helped my social anxiety slightly, but my depression - no. I am aware of the state that I am in, and I am simply tired of it. My future is all dark, I don't see things getting better. When I spoke with my girlfriend this weekend, I cried the entire night...  I just couldn't take everything anymore. I saw a new psychologist last week, but again, I feel like I'm being lectured. I am eighteen years old, and being talked to as if I were twelve. It's insulting and makes me feel even more left out of things than I already do. I don't know.

"I feel really bad for not coming to the forum much last week. i have been in turmoil. Things at home are not going well at all. My husband got his new house and is moving in the next few weeks ... incidentally that is not the problem. I am happy that he is leaving. He has been a real jerk lately. He says mean things to me and he is angry all of the time. He has been working on the road for the past month so we only have to tolerate each other on the weekends  - thank goodness. When he comes home the first thing that he does is go up to the computer room and say hi to his buddies ... not to me and not to our son (in fact he only spend a total of one hour with our son on the weekends). When he finally graces us with his presence he just complains. I did SO much work around the house last week - I cut the grass, weeded the garden, watered the lawn everyday, vacuumed the house from top to bottom, washed the floors on the main floor of the house, did all of the laundry, patched some dents in the walls and painted them, cleaned out our son's room .... and still he managed to find things that were 'wrong'. He even had the audacity to tell me that I am a pig and nothing gets done around here. I just can't take it anymore. All he does is get angry and complain. I finally realized this weekend that I am not his problem. He is just using me as an excuse. I have tried to talk to him and all he wants to do is play the blame game. We have agreed to not see each other for the month of august so that each of us can decide what it is that we want to do regarding our relationship. Even that ticked him off. When I asked him if he would like me to send our son with his parents when they come to visit him he got mad that I wasn't going to come see him. The 'no seeing each other in August' was entirely his idea. I have no clue what is going on in his head. I have tried and tried to talk to him and the only reply I get is defensive or aggressive. I am at my wits' end and am about to give up. I care very much for him and I know that there is something wrong but I cannot help him. I am so afraid of giving up on us though because I am riddled with the 'what ifs'. I want a family so bad. am I settling though? I hate saying that because my husband is not a terrible man. He has his finer qualities it is just that lately they are few and far between. He has even told me that he would cheat on me if given the chance. And that he might have while drunk one night and that the girl has told other people that the baby she is carrying might be his. You know the more that I write the more I feel like an idiot. What a fucking doormat. What the hell am I doing? i am putting my happiness and wellbeing on the back burner for someone who has told me repeatedly that he no longer loves me and thinks that he has had an affair (or at the least would like to). How pathetic can you get. What a glutton for punishment I am. Why is it that I feel that he is more important than me? You know I thought that I was doing better on the medication - I might not be having the emotional outbursts but I still have the low - or should I say non-existent self esteem. If only all of this could be over. If only he could either WAKE up and figure out what he wants to do or just fuck off and never see me or our son again. That would make my life so much easier. I fear for my son. I do not want my husband's anger to hurt our son. I don't want husband to take out his frustrations on a two year old. I worry about sending our son to visit him. Without me there or the dogs, xxxx is the only one there to take the abuse. Anyway that is what I have been dealing with the past week. As a result of all of this I have been on a self destruct mode. I have not been sleeping, i have been late for work and I have been unprepared many times. I am glad that the last day is this Thursday. i will have a month to 'detox'. I need it.

"Lately i have been having some very vivid story - like dreams, normally i can't follow my dreams because they switch too quickly. i had a dream where i took my grandmother's large knife and a permanent marker and wrote my signature on it. Then later my mother found out about what i had done and became so angry with what i had done, that she made me cry, and i actually woke up crying. Then later that day i took a nap and i dreamt that i was being seduced by Tom Cruise, (who had gained a lot of weight), and when things began to heat up i rejected him, and he became very angry at me. He then later came to the house where i was, and began trying to hurt me and the people around me (which was an older lady, a young boy and teenage girl). i could hear him saying ""just kill them"" and talking about how he was really embarrassed when i rejected him, and he could do so much better than me. i then proceeded to take the young boy into hiding, and while hiding we were found and the boy hurt Tom defensively, but in a very graphic manor. I can't understand why i'm having such negative dreams, why they are so vivid, and what they all mean!",1,lately having vivid story like dream normally follow dream switch quickly dream took grandmother large knife permanent marker wrote signature it later mother angry done cry actually woke cry later day took nap dreamt seduced tom cruise who gained lot weight thing began heat rejected him angry me later came house wa began trying hurt people which older lady young boy teenage girl hear saying just kill them talking really embarrassed rejected him better me proceeded young boy hiding hiding boy hurt tom defensively graphic manor understand having negative dream vivid mean
"I feel like nothing works or will work out, can someone relate? It‘s always like I try something and want to better myself, have high expectations and then life comes, uppercuts me, spits on me and just screams „You thought, bitch“.   I had a really good therapist but she suddenly quit due to illness.    I had to wait several months until I got the final answer. Had no therapy in that time between and also we only had like 6 sessions.   Now I have a therapist who is ok but I just don‘t vibe with her that much. And I can‘t change because of insurance. Nor do I have the money to pay for one myself since I‘m a broke ass student.    I told her once that I don‘t want solutions. I want someone to genuienly understand me. At first she tried and now it’s all solutions again. „Try this, try that, we need to experiment“. I get the thought but I feel like my deep down feelings are just irrelevant once again.   My first therapist really understood me and listened. I could cry my heart out and afterwards I felt so much lighter.    I really miss that feeling.   Now it‘s just an obligation I have to do. Back then I never used to come late to my therapy sessions because I really looked forward to it.   But now I am constantly running late because deep down, I just don‘t want to go anymore and give up. I don‘t have energy for that.   I also took anti depressants (Tianeurax if anyone knows that one). At first it helped me, especially with processing feelings.   But then I turned super suicidal and had mental breakdowns over mental breakdowns.    I completly stopped and now I feel numb again. I want to feel suicidal and emotional again, to be honest. At least I processed something. Now I feel empty and dead inside once again, like how I used to be all the years before I started therapy and taking anti depressants.   My „new“ therapist asked me what I can bear more. My suicidal state or this passive suicidal state. I told her the last one. But honestly, I want it to be the first one.   At least I felt like a human. At least some people cared because they were afraid I‘d do something to myself.   Now no one cares. I‘m alone. I don‘t go outside anymore. I‘m just isolating myself again. No one really talks to me and I‘m just a bother to everyone.    I honestly think about taking my anti depressants again, just to get suicidal and off myself.   Despite often being a bad actor, I am just so well at playing this role of „Of course, I will try! I will do my best“.   I‘m good at pretending nothing bother‘s me and everything‘s fine. I‘m good at pretending to say „Wow, your advice helped me so much, thank you for listening!“.   But I‘m just a fraud. Nothing helps. Afterwards I just want to die more.    Sometimes I ask myself, why the hell do I even put up with all of this. The only reason why I haven‘t killed myself yet is because it‘d financially ruin my family.   I don‘t even care about emotions, I doubt it‘d be that bad. No one likes me anyway. Just so they don‘t get into debt with my death or sth.    I often find myself also thinking that I will never leave a goodbye letter or tell them goodbye. Because no one cares anyway. I told them many times before why I want to die.   I don‘t feel like anyone deserves that anyway because they don‘t put as much energy into me as I put into them.    Whenever I feel like it goes up, it just crumbles down. I really don‘t know how much of this I can take.   I‘ve been like this since 6 years old. I‘m 21 now. I don‘t know why I got thrown into this world when I‘m ridden and infested with mental illnesses.

"My friends fall out with the rest of the group as we don’t agree with them on genders. I’m just going to get straight to the point, I have these two friends ( I’ll call them Ava and Chloe) who fall out with me and the rest of my friends as they believe there’s more that two genders and the rest of us don’t believe that (I’m not saying they can’t believe that but I’m just saying the way that they act when we say we don’t is bad). They usually talk to us the day after and act like nothing happened, but it bothers me. So here’s a summary of what happens. Someone brings up the topic of genders, and then will say how they think there’s two, then either Ava or chole will get mad and will storm of or start shouting at us. Ava once called my boyfriend a “close minded cunt” simply because he said he didn’t agree with her. If they believe that there’s more than two genders, I am totally ok with that, it’s just that they try and make the rest of us believe it too and then put the blame onto us and it’s starting to bug me. So if anyone knows what I can do about this, I’d be really glad if you could help me out.

"it don't get no better than this Last night was a success. I was in truly rare form. My last non-fuzzy memory is of chugging beers at a friend's around 10:30, but highlights of the night include: making out with two of my girl friends; flashing one of my more reserved friends (reaction: ""Did she just flash me??""); waking up this morning with a stranger's cell phone on my desk (a peek through the phone book, and I was pretty sure he's not a law student), but thankfully no owner of the cell phone in my bed; doing way too many shots when, after being asked if I wanted to do shots, I responded, ""I really shouldn't do whiskey shots... Bring me the tequila!"" and apparently a solid effort at drunk dialing, if the outgoing call log on my cell is any indication. We had a really fun night, but then getting shitty with friends is always a good time. I think I was still drunk when I went to Civ Pro this morning, hmm. The bar we went to is dead on Thursday nights (though really packed on Friday and Saturday nights). It was nice, though -- we had the bar to ourselves. About 40 people showed up, and after talking to us for awhile, the owner said he'd give us drink specials on Thursday nights if we came back. He even comped a lot of our drinks, which was cool. We'll definitely be back. I liked this place already, but this is true incentive. A couple people are out tonight, but I lost my steam after Happy Hour. I just felt too exhausted to even think about going out. I made macaroni & cheese, sat on the couch, and watched TV.

"Conservative republican parents &amp; liberal arts educated democrat child...what could go wrong? I grew up in a poor household, but was able to use this to my advantage to get scholarships to private school and an elite liberal arts college. After graduating from school and coming back home, I realized that I have absolutely nothing in common with my parents anymore. They do not understand the concept of privilege, think everyone on welfare is lazy, voted for Trump and defend him and every time I get legitimately pissed off at them, they say that the school I went to brainwashed me and made me crazy and in doing so they completely invalidate all the hard work and effort I had to put in not only to get into this school, but working two jobs while there and still maintaining a 3.5 GPA. I was a sociology major, too, so these issues are literally what I spent most of my four years studying. It's now at the point where I cannot have a conversation with my father without it blowing up. It gets worse by the issue and the WORST part is that they are decent and loving people. Is there anyone else on here who is in a similar situation? What do you do? I'm slowly losing my mind trying to argue at this point.

" Super Smash Bros. Melee is my most favorite game in the world. It is a four-player fighting game that has super simple moves compared to other fighting games. However, don't think that it is an easy game to beat and no fun to play. You still must master moves for a character just like you would for any other fighting game. You have to know when to sidestep dodge, jump, and attack your opponent. You have to know when to roll behind and when to retreat. Only true master can beat Giga Bowser and the Master and Crazy hand!  Not only do you have to beat Classic, Adventure, and All-Star mode, you also have to beat all the event matches and get all 290 trophies! This is a must have for any Gamecube owner, and that means YOU! Buy it now! I am saying this out of my own love towards the game, and I am not a walking advertiser :)  Recently, there was a Melee Tournament in our area, and out of two and a half pages worth of people, guess who came out first...ME! I got hoards of stuff! I love being the best at Melee! Surprisingly, they never got me down to one life! It consisted of many three life stock battles. I brought my memory card and they let me use it because they had NO characters. I have 100 percent beaten that game.  Also, I have kept a profile name. It has over 1000 wins and around fifty losses. No, I play my brothers and Level 9 CPUs. I stopped the playing timer at 9,999:59! That's around 163 hours, and I know that I played more than that! I am a freak of this game and have emailed Nintendo multiple times on when the next Super Smash will come, but they said there has been none announced. If you know PLEASE TELL ME. I hope the DS will have the game. Just think... PORTABLE SUPER SMASH!!!  If you think you can beat me in Melee, I think I can beat you. You may not be easy, but I'm trying to become the best in the world! Come talk to me If YOU LOVE SUPER SMASH BROS. MELEE!!!!  I also have the original Super Smash Bros., but I think it's nothing compared to Melee. All you have to do in that game is throw. It's fake, but I still like it. You can talk to me about that too.

"I made it so much worse Hey guys, haven’t been on reddit long, or this subreddit either. Never intended to post something, but recent events have changed that. So, I’ll start with some background,  I’m a 17 year old high school student. My best friend is 17 too, (Who will be referred to as Golf from now on) We didn’t even know each other before the school year started, but we had a couple mutual friends and we just... connected. It’s one of those friendships where it doesn’t really make sense, to anyone, let alone either of us, it’s like we’re family. It’s the only way I can describe it.   Anyway, we’re dipshit high schoolers, so we joke about depression and suicide in our friend group. The group knows Golf has depression, they have no clue about mine though. Anyway, when I started hanging out with him I did what I’ve been doing for a year and a half. Joking about my depression and making jokes about offing myself. I didn’t know Golf had it until a couple months ago, but soon after we started hanging out he started joking about it too. Well he got reported to the counseling center, a couple of times in fact. But they’re honestly useless, so it didn’t help. It came to a head last night when the group basically kidnapped him and forced him to go to a hospital. They didn’t tell me for whatever reason. I still haven’t figured out why. But eventually I got there. The night is a blur from there, I didn’t eat anything since breakfast, and that was noodles. As I’m just now typing this I realize that I’m at around 30 hours without food now. But that’s not important. I did my best to be there for Golf. He went home safe with his parents and is going to go to therapy/counseling. It was an awful day yesterday, a couple of events made Golf’s depression way worse for him. I’m glad we got him to the hospital before he hurt himself.  But it’s my fault, I know it is. I don’t need you guys telling me how it isn’t either. You wont change my mind. It is my fault, I taught him that suicide and depression could be treated as a joke. I made it worse. I hate myself for it. I don’t know what to do. Hell, I don’t know why I made this post at all. I don’t know if I want advice, or vent, or see if there’s someone else out there who has gone through something like this. Right now he’s on a trip with his mom and dad golfing.  Golf (the activity) is one of the few things he enjoys. All I want to do is lay in my bed and not exist in the outside world for the rest of spring break. I don’t want to take any attention away from Golf. He deserves it more than I do. I just don’t know what to do anymore.  (I’m sorry for the rambling and any punctuation/grammar errors).

"Not good enough. Greetings, everyone. I am currently in need of venting my thoughts. Reddit seems like the perfect environment for fucked up people, like myself. I've come for the wisdom and maybe even the charming assholes. So, here's the scoop:  Growing up, I was always compared to a specific relative. I won't say which, because I'm a paranoid fucker. But we shared the same gender, were of similar ages, and were always very different from each other. Still, we were extremely close. The biggest difference was our weight. Yes, I was always the ""larger"" one. People enjoyed to point it out, but what really stung was that our own family would as well. Fast forward to years later, when we were in our teenage years. It became so much more than our weight. Our family started comparing our physical appearances. They were always the more ""attractive"" one. The more ""successful"" one. We are both adults now. Our grandmother speaks wonders of this person, and only has negative things to say about me. Despite all of this, I was always deemed the ""nicer"" one. That hasn't mattered a single bit. I constantly beat myself for picking up the phone when our grandmother calls, because I give her personal details of my life only for her to turn around and use it as juicy gossip material. She is very sick, and I assume quite close to death. I pick up because I feel massive guilt when I ignore her calls, while my ever-so-""better"" relative ignores them with no problem, and is still worshipped. I've considered cutting ties with my entire family. I don't believe they genuinely care about me. Yeah, I'm struggling. Bad. I'm basically at rock bottom right now. Still, I highly doubt my wellbeing is in their best interest at all. I don't think I'll ever be the picture perfect grandchild, child, sibling, whatever. It drowns me deep in self-loathing every day.",0,not good enough greeting everyone currently need venting thought reddit like perfect environment fucked people like myself come wisdom maybe charming asshole so scoop growing up compared specific relative not say which paranoid fucker shared gender similar age different other still extremely close biggest difference weight yes larger one people enjoyed point out really stung family well fast forward year later teenage year weight family started comparing physical appearance attractive one successful one adult now grandmother speaks wonder person negative thing say me despite this deemed nicer one not mattered single bit constantly beat picking phone grandmother call personal detail life turn use juicy gossip material sick assume quite close death pick feel massive guilt ignore call eversobetter relative ignores problem worshipped considered cutting tie entire family not believe genuinely care me yeah struggling bad basically rock right now still highly doubt wellbeing best all not think picture perfect grandchild child sibling whatever drowns deep selfloathing day
"I'm actually feeling a little bit like a fraud at the moment, because I've read so many different topics today and realized that there are people who have suffered far more than I have. I've joined this site, to start to try and get some help for myself and to talk about the things that have caused me to feel like this over the last few years. My doctor has told me that I'm depressed and prescribed tablets, but I refuse to believe this and have not taken them. I know that this is wrong, but I hate the idea of being labeled depressed. Before I went to university, I was happy, adventurous, nothing could keep me down. I was in a fantastic relationship, but then I moved into halls, in a flat with six others, who I absolutely adored. One of them in particular, who I fell in love with. Little did I know that he had also fallen for me in the same way, but we were both so shy and I was in a relationship, that neither of us did anything about it ...... until we moved into a house together in our second year with 3 others. This is when everything went wrong. We were always close, really close in fact, and I admitted to him that I kept getting urges to kiss him, hold him and never let him go. He felt the same way as I did, but still nothing was done by either of us. Then one evening we were both out, getting drunk with friends, we found ourselves alone when we got back to the house and kissed. I've never felt like I did that night since. I didn't care about anything around me. We were the only 2 people in the world at that moment. The next morning, we were both a bit bemused and didn't know what to say / do, so pretended like nothing had happened. The end of term came and we had just moved in to another house with the same people, but were all going home for the summer. I was devastated knowing that we wouldn't see each other until september. I began to resent my boyfriend who I was still with and my family were going through problems because of my father. When september came, I went straight onto my final teaching placement, which meant up at 530 work all day, home, eat ,work and then in bed by 11pm. I was tired all the time and didn't have the energy to go out in the week, but He was always there for me, and yes, we were still pretending like nothing had happened. After the christmas of my final year, I decided to party like never before. It was great, but there was still the issue of him. By now I had been trying to convince myself that I was still in love with my boyfriend, purely because I didn't have the guts to leave him and be on my own. How pathetic was that. Anyway, we went out to the union for a major drinking session, danced like a couple, felt like a couple, got back to the house and one thing led to another. We ended up sleeping together in his room, he initiated it. It was amazing. However the next day we were so confused that we didn't speak for 2 days, until I told him how I really felt. That I had been in love with him since my first year, but couldn't do anything about it, that I was going mad inside because I wanted him so much. He returned my feelings. From then on, we were inseparable, but to anyone who saw us together, we were just 2 very very close friends, who lived in each others' pockets. We were having an affair of sorts and living a lie, but we found comfort in each other and couldn't let it go. I know how wrong it was, believe me I do, and I would be devastated if it ever happened to me. We left university in the june of 2004. It was the worst time of my life. I felt like I was losing part of me, and was never going to get it back. Before we left and before the lie really started, I had agreed to move in with my boyfriend in leeds for his final year. I didn't want to do this anymore, but was too chicken to say no, so this went ahead and for the last year, july 04 until now, I have been living with my boyfriend. Things have not been good and I have still been seeing Him (from university) as often as I can. The most recent one was a couple of days ago. We have both joked about running away, children, marriage, but neither of us has got the guts to do anything. It is so wrong and has made my life so difficult, putting on a brave face for friends and family, pretending that I'm happy all of the time. I don't think I can do it much longer. One last thing, while all of this was going on in my life, my dad was causing mayhem at home. I was being pushed and pulled between the 2 people that I thought could get through anything and that were truly in love. How wrong can you be. I was like a piece of meat being fought over by 2 animals. They constantly bitched about each other to me, leaving me with no - one to talk to. I found myself being dragged further and further down in to a pit which I can't get out of. I'm in love with Him, but will not leave my boyfriend for fear of being alone, I resent my father for what he has done, I resent my mother for being callous, there is no - one that I have told this to over the past 4 years, nobody who I felt that I could really trust. I don't know what to do anymore. I cry at the smallest thing, hate things changing at all, but most of all, I can't see the point of going on anymore. I just want these feelings to end. My one savior has been my work, teaching children. caring for others and helping them make the most of their lives makes me feel like I'm doing something worthwhile. I'm not expecting any replies, I just needed someone / thing to listen.

"I feel like a useless member of my family I may not help as much as the perfect husband would around the house. But, I’d like to think I do a decent share of what traditionally a husband should be doing. My wife is not the most organized person in the world so me and her butt heads a lot when it come to finding things around the house. Car keys, laundry, tools, you name it, they will get lost around the house.   I have tried taking my own copies of keys with me in my backpack to work or where ever I go. This way I don’t have to be asking her all the time where to find X item. This was working til she lost her copy of the truck keys and had to call me to bring my copy to her one day. Since then, I only bring the key of the car that I bring with me. Well,.... didn’t take too long til that one got lost too.... I needed to use the truck and was not able to find any key anywhere. I asked her where it was and she responded with “you have hands and eyes, you find it”. I blew my top off. I yelled at her that the fact that I have to hide things for them to not get lost in the house is ridiculous!   She brought up the fact that I could do more around the house like organize the laundry or help her keep the home tidy. I told her I would if she wasn’t so damn unorganized. Every time i do end up helping her organize and clean she ends up messing everything up the next day anyway!   She is type A personality and I would like to think I am type A-. I yield to her way of living most of the time til it gets to be too much. Maybe the reason I don’t do more around the house is because it will yield the same results anyway, an unorganized mess.... I at least do the basics. I pickup after dinner. I take out the trash, (this job now goes to my son). Handyman work, I fix plumbing, appliances, broken doors, tv’s, computers, iPhones.  I would like to think that I play my role as a dad as perfect as I can. I help with homework, I play with my kids all the time. I feed them when mom works early or wants to sleep in/go to bed early.  She’s mad at me and I feel like I am trying my best but my best is not good enough. Also, says I have become obese because of my laziness...... that one really hurt..... I try to walk/jog a good 30-40 minutes 2-3 times a week if I have time.   I broke down in my car today after seeing some old photos of my kids when they were babies.....

"I’m trying to get communication back with my best friend. I have an idea, it won’t be easy and it may never work, but it’s worth a shot? Long story short: I’ve been depressed and I have a friend. I could make a 5 paragraph story about my friend and my depression. But I want to get to the point. I don’t want to make this post too long otherwise no one will read it.  My friend made the decision to stop communication with me until I go to a residential psychiatric program or somewhere similar. The thing is I’ve been in one already, it was a pretty flexible place, cell phones were allowed, doors were never locked, etc. Long story short I became “too high risk” and am not allowed back. And I don’t want to go back. I don’t believe in happiness by mental health, I believe in natural happiness. I believe that all humans deserve to feel happy without being told “your life sucks so you need pills and mental health treatment to be happy.”  So anyways, I can’t fulfill his wish. But getting communication back with him is all I want. There are no exceptions.  So here’s my idea. Just for fun I livestream games on YouTube. I do it for fun, not for fame, I don’t play those popular games, I play the ones that no one plays. It’s unlikely for a video to get more than 100 views. But I’ve considered starting a new channel. I will livestream games, post videos about my custom Guitar Hero songs (I do that for fun too) and just pretty much show that I’m having fun. But the big goal of the channel will be to “get my friend back”. That’ll be the whole idea. That will be written on every video. That’s what the channel art will say. Think of it as a gofundme, only I’m not asking for money, I’m asking for support from the public to hear my story, hear what I’m doing, and to be there with me when my friend does deliver.  Here’s the catch. For obvious reasons, his name will never be revealed. No one will have any idea who my friend is. But little by little, I will try to reveal the channel to him. It’ll start with the channel being named “Ian”, then sooner or later add my last name. As time goes on I’ll try and find ways to give him clues about the channel without actually telling him anything.  The big dream is that he eventually discovers the channel, and with whatever support there is, he will see how much I’ve mentally improved over however long it takes.  This all may sound totally silly, totally bogus, yeah, maybe this will never work in a million years. Just a wild thought that I’m going to attempt anyways. I might edit this post with a link to the channel depending on the response here.",1,trying communication best friend idea not easy work worth shot long story short depressed friend make paragraph story friend depression want point not want make post long read it friend decision stop communication residential psychiatric program similar thing already pretty flexible place cell phone allowed door locked etc long story short high risk not allowed back not want back not believe happiness mental health believe natural happiness believe human deserve feel happy told life suck need pill mental health treatment happy anyways fulfill wish getting communication want exception idea just fun livestream game youtube fun not fame not play popular game play one play unlikely video view considered starting new channel livestream game post video custom guitar hero song i fun too just pretty having fun big goal channel friend back idea written video channel art say think gofundme not asking money asking support public hear story hear doing friend doe deliver catch obvious reason revealed idea friend is little little try reveal channel him start channel named ian sooner later add name time go try way clue channel actually telling anything big dream eventually discovers channel support is mentally improved long take sound totally silly totally bogus yeah maybe work million year just wild thought going attempt anyways edit post link channel depending response here

"I Just Want to Feel Normal I’ll try to make this as short as possible, I swear.... And please bear with me. I know this is overwhelming and a lot is jumbled, but I have no other outlet....  I’m so tired of living. I’m not suicidal by any means, and I’m not talking about ending my life or anything, but I’m so TIRED of living in the mental state that I’m in.  I can’t afford a therapist, and the ones that have been recommended because they work with your income are awful....  My depression didn’t hit until after my first child was born almost three years ago. Since then, I have been a WRECK, but have gotten much MUCH better over the course of the years. I’ve been on Celexa (60mg) for about a year which helped tremendously, but had to do away wth it once I hit my third trimester of this pregnancy (I’m currently 21 weeks).  ALL OF THESE SYMPTOMS happened before I got pregnant a second time, and have been intensified since becoming pregnant...  —I’m constantly moody. My emotions change with the drop of a hat. —I’m constantly wondering why my husband stays with me (he is a GREAT GREAT supporting, caring lover) and am always thinking he deserves better —I hate waking up on the weekends because I feel like I have no purpose (my almost-three year old is pretty easy to manage despite being rambunctious) —I am too self conscious to even get out and do something if I know the place I want to go to will be crowded —I have NO motivation to do anything. Walking to get some fresh air? Nope. Getting out of the house just for a moment to change scenery? Not a chance. —Everything that I try to do I have NO attention span to continue.  Ive tried reading, cross stitching, writing, adult coloring books, ANYTHING to make my life seem more interesting and pleasurable....and I just can’t stick to anything.   I’m sorry.

" Today? Is a word, which means the present day, time, or age? So today would be  June 17, 2004, the time 2:00AM, and the age not sure yet. How about I rewind back to this morning and then tell a little about what got me here today……  (Place here the most annoying sound in the world) that would be my alarm. It’s 10:30 in the morning (I just went to bed 5 hours ago) so what do I do? I hit the snooze button. Six thousand beeps and an hour later I finally decide to wake up but not by choice. My sister Whitney runs into my room and tells me something don’t know what she said because my mind was still on weather or not I was wearing cloths. By time I got up and took a shower puts some cloths on. I figured out that she was telling me that the food was ready my Step-Dad had made lunch. So I eat then walk back to my cave (my room) to continue my computing experiences. Which doesn’t ever end.  From there on I just sat and sat watched some movies and listened to some music. Talk on the devil I mean AIM. 8 hours later I go to the best place to eat SUBWAY. Then I retreated back home to continue my online enjoyment. This went on till about a hour ago when I remembered a Tech TV show called “Call for Help” (use to watch it a lot till the show got canceled a few weeks ago)  Where a guy said something about blogger.com. So I was like what the heck, and checked it out. So here I am now setting here in the dark, except the glow from my monitor writing about the most boringness day in the world, or just close to it.

"I'm 29, female and i live in the UK. My background with depression is that i started suffering from it significantly when i was 18 and have been on various antidepressants since. I've recently come off Effexor (venlafaxine) after about 5 years of being on it, at mostly the 150 mg dose, and this has been the only antidepressant that's properly helped me. Two months ago i decided to come off it, as id been wanting to at least lower the dose i was taking, for some time. Also my doctors surgery are now ""funnier"" about prescribing it to new patients because of the reports of heart murmurs among some patients. I've been taking citalopram, at either 20 mg or 40 mg but i don't really like these medications and after this month is up I'm hoping to come off them, either to go on something else or to stop taking antidepressants altogether, those are my options. But the truth is ..... and my doctor is wondering as well .... what medications would i go on next? I've felt pretty rotten lately and the citalopram has done little for me except negative stuff, it makes me want to just take the venlafaxine again!

" So...this is my first entry in my blog.  I've had blogs before, but I seem to never update them...and then I forget what the website is to my blog.  Hopefully I'll update this one.  So, my name is Tiffany, I live in Virginia Beach, and I'm going to be a sophomore at Princess Anne High School in September.  I am a Madrigal in my school's chorus, which is supposed to be an honor, but it really isn't.  My best friend is Keeley.  She is so awesome and is just like me; we met at the beginning of the school year, when she moved here from San Diego.  Which is kind of funny because that is where I was born.  We were very lucky this year to go traveling together with our school.  We are both drama geeks and got to go to a thespian conference at Longwood University and we also got to go to New York City, which was absolutely amazing.  After going to New York I decided that I am going to move there when I get out of high school.     Anyways... I am currently in a production of the play Twelfth Night by Shakespeare.  It has been such an amazing experience and I have made some great friends.  First there's Matt... he is so sexy, talented, and fun to be around, but unfortunately he is gay.  Then there's Sam... he is also sexy, talented, and fun to be with, but he has a girlfriend who he is absolutely in love with.  Rebekkah, who is almost exactly like me, is so much fun to be with...""She kills me!""  Unfortunately, we only have three more performances and then it's all over.    Well that's all I really have to say right now.... but I'll right more later.

" I'm new here - left an introductory ramble in the appropriate section.  I've been depressed (both clinically recognized or otherwise) for around 15 years (I'm 20 for the record).  After 3 - 4 months of a ""good"" period I'm finding that I'm slipping back into that ""black hole"".  I'm looking for support and very happy to offer everyone all I have to help, even if it's little.

"How do I befriend my crush? So there's this girl (21/f) that I (21/f) really, really like. I live in a super homophobic country. I've accepted the fact that nothing can happen between us. However, she's just such, such an amazing person, that even if we weren't romantically involved, I would want her in my life, as a friend, because she's just so great - no joke. I'm not sure what her impression of me is. My crush and I actually have a ton of mutual acquaintances and friends. We've even worked together on an event before, but it was a large scale event with a large team, so I didn't really feel much. She once even smiled at me when she saw me!  I have a friend who once had a guy give her chocolate that he “couldn’t finish” when we were in the library. The next day, he messaged her on Facebook, saying she probably felt weirded out by what he did – she responded to him, and they started talking to each other. They’ve now been dating for over a year. The bottom line is, with all this information in mind, how do I approach my crush to hopefully start a friendship with her? I've been warned that I should draw a mental boundary between feelings of friendship and romantic feelings, which I’m set on doing. I would do what my friend’s boyfriend did, but with these chocolate chip cookies I baked, though I'm not sure if it'd be a good idea. It would seem a little weird, wouldn’t it?  Even with my friend’s boyfriend, we knew his intentions from the start. My crush and I are both girls, however, so I suppose that changes things a little (we do live in a heteronormative society). With all that said, I’m pretty desperate, as she’s graduating soon, and I really don’t want to miss my chance. She's completed all her subjects and is currently only working on her dissertation. She's often in the student lounge, doing work - though I'm not sure what her schedule is like and what days she's in campus. Please help with creative ways to approach my crush (like my friend's boyfriend did)!

Today is the second day I'm missing classes. My first one starts in an hour and I live too far away to get there in time at this point. I couldn't get out of bed, and had the same problem yesterday. I just get this feeling of dread when I think about getting ready and actually leaving, and all I feel like I can do is lie in bed thinking about different ways I could kill myself (I'm not going to, it's just something I seem to always end up thinking about in bed, I know it's toxic but it's comforting).  I really can't miss any more classes after today, this semester is really important for my grades.

"Hi, I am Ellen a.k.a. Froggie girl62, a 43-year-old female who has been depressed for life. I have been labeled as having dysthymia in the past. Although it was never officially shared with me, I believe from what I have read that I was depressed even as a child. I graduated college the first time in 1985 with a BA in Sociology with Medical Emphasis and have worked in the medical transcription field for 19 years. I have become bored with the job and dissatisfied with being forced to work from home. (Majorly boring!) Last year I started going back to school to pursue a Masters in Fine Arts in Graphic Design. This has been a huge challenge since I am brand new in the art field and most of the other students are already artists. In addition, I MUST work 40 hours a week to maintain my health insurance benefits. My mom has been my best friend and support person forever and now she has been diagnosed with lung cancer. She had surgery 2 months ago and just began chemotherapy last week. I have had an awful time dealing with this. Although she has been given a fairly decent prognosis, I am scared that she is going to leave me and would trade places with her in flash if I could. Truthfully I am disappointed every day when I wake up. I save lots of money on products to remove mascara, as the tears usually do the job. I had been on Zoloft 25 mg since the late 1990s and my family doctor increased it first to 50 and now to 100 mg. I have also started seeing a psychiatrist, only 2 sessions so far, so hard to say much about that. In the past when I went for counseling, they just gave me silly assignments and told me to go out and meet people. With my school work, I have enough assignments already. I found this forum from a post on another support forum.",1,hi ellen aka froggie girl yearold female depressed life labeled having dysthymia past officially shared me believe read depressed child graduated college time ba sociology medical emphasis worked medical transcription field year bored job dissatisfied forced work home majorly boring year started going school pursue master fine art graphic design huge challenge brand new art field student artist addition work hour week maintain health insurance benefit mom best friend support person forever diagnosed lung cancer surgery month ago just began chemotherapy week awful time dealing this given fairly decent prognosis scared going leave trade place flash could truthfully disappointed day wake up save lot money product remove mascara tear usually job zoloft mg late s family doctor increased mg started seeing psychiatrist session far hard say that past went counseling just gave silly assignment told meet people school work assignment already forum post support forum

"For the first time in my life i liked this girl and when she left life around me doesn't make sense. Why does this pain happen to people This is my first time and please i need some answers on what to do, why does life work this way, i fucking hate that things had to go wrong this fucking way. My depression is taking over me and my family is worried about me.  For the first time in high school i liked this girl for about 7 months and during that time we became best friends and i always thought she would like me if i cared for her and treated her right. i always acted the same way as her and found out we thought the same sometimes. We always talked to each other including late night till 2 or 3 am and we knew everything about each other and we always were with each other but instead she liked some asshole who didn't like me and always kept lying about me to her. She never believed what he said about me but chose to love him and be with him more and they always were with each other after class and it made me jealous and angry on why she would do this. One day i invited her to some place with her and my friends but she decided to also want to take the asshole and i got frustrated and ended our friendship. she got angry at me and decided to leave too. but one day the asshole decided to leave her because of a fight they had and she starts crying to me on the phone and i try to help her get over him but it hurts me when she says she loves this person who kept lying to her about me and other things and he was known to be a bad person and she only dated one guy before but he was super nice and i didn't understand why she liked him and she said she didn't either, it was only that she felt happy around him. She is such a pretty girl and most of the guys in the school agree and thought me and her were dating but they never knew she really liked this asshole and during the time they hanged out she kept asking me if they were right for each other and she said she would separate from him but she didn't listen to me. Instead they got closer and me and this asshole got into more fights with each other but she would rather not say anything and still be with him. Now she is actually separating from him after all this time. Why did she do this to me after everything we've been through because i treated her way better but she did this to me and i dont know should i go back to her after what she did. Its been 2 weeks and i haven't talked to her since then and my mind has been thinking of ways to beat myself up because of this problem.

"Failure to trust ‘’those on my side’’. [possible trigger Warning] I find myself incapable of trusting my spouse. I’ve been with my SO for nearly 15 years, 7 married this year, we have 3 children. Before I hit my mid-teens I’d been through nearly a decade of sexual abuse within the already dysfunctional household I grew up one, with an alcoholic father and a narcissistic mother.  I met my now spouse when I was 17. He had been in a two year relationship with a girl a few years his senior, which left him broken after her infidelity. And I… well I lived day to day, carrying what I could. I’ll never forgot how I coldly and factually told him with a mere two sentences what I had to endure, telling him that if he did chose me, he would be settling for a lifetime shared with a woman with severe ups and downs due to her limited mental strength. He convinced me to go for it and I wept in his arms. That was probably the first time in my life someone did not look the other way and I allowed myself to be vulnerable, instead of distant and cold. I opened myself up to him.  Few years later my home situation imploded. I ran. His mother took me under her wing, I think she was the first parental figure I could lean on in my life. His father loathed me as the girl from the slums, threatening me in private to never marry his son. Reminding me of my lowly descent when he could. He would never come to accept me fully but at least fully respects me in public, which to me is commendable enough.  Afterwards I started living with my now SO, still during our teens in a studio. The idea was triggered and pushed for by me as a solution after a bout of infidelity on his side after he moved to study in a city a couple hours away. He partook in intimate relations with a girl he knew from another country over webcam due to ‘’loneliness’’ and held the act in the same regards as watching porn whereas I didn’t. We tried to work things out.  As we did my view of him started to crumble, but was rebuilt after living together surprisingly worked remarkably well. We grew more towards each other and were best friends on top of lovers. In between this life changing chapter and where I am now, he has had a few strikes I simply can not forget. While I was once open to share my ups and downs and sadness with him, now I’d rather not. Because where I once trusted him to hold me, I now trust him to ridicule me and tell me to man the fuck up. And the stubborn ass I am, I do, but this comes with resentment. But to explain the strikes:  - One is where I was crying after having particularly bad and involuntary memories. Annoyed by my state and stressed by upcoming finals he asked me: When is this going to end? You’re always spinning the same old tales, you’re driving yourself insane.  - Another was when he screamed out while we had visitors: How would you like it if I told everyone you were raped? He believed I had done something utterly despicable, blame was pinned upon me by one of his siblings. In that moment something broke, the attack was 100% unwarranted. So much trust lost. When he figured out I had done nothing to him the apologies came swift and numerous.  - One was when I asked him for a letter. He will always buy flowers on special occasions, which I hate. They wither and die. I just hate the sentiment, I dislike it and I have communicated this. I wanted something which lasts. A reminder. All I wanted was a letter. Years I secretly yearned for one but received flowers instead, which I still tended to. Finally… I asked for a letter. He refused and told me point blank to my face he would not. That it was silly I needed something to hold onto, and that this item would become something of an unhealthy obsession.  - The latest strike was after I endured a panic attack while I was on my own, which I managed myself before he returned home. He was upset when I confided in him and he stated: I will not be on your side if you are mentally ill. I will choose our children and make sure they grow up with stability. (Later he corrected himself and stated that if I was to turn schizophrenic or manic, he would have me committed and divorce me, but would support me through depression and anxiety).  Now to me a panic attack is something manageable if you are equipped to deal with it. Through the years I have learned to be aware of my surroundings and triggers and to be prepared to deal with anything since I am responsible for my children. I have no history of hysterical or erratic behavior, so I found his reaction to my first ever panic attack very… crude.  I have my pride even through my depression for what I have survived and what I have accomplished. But I hate that I can not find it in myself again to open up towards my spouse and more than often find myself crying when I am capable to, so I can put up my smile and brave face when I NEED to. I’ve successfully faked it till I made it. And of the 15 years that we have been together the good by far outweighs the bad, something which can not be conveyed well enough in this post. But what has been said can be never taken back. Even though recently he said: Don't you understand after 15 years I am on your side?   I understand. I hate that I can’t be vulnerable anymore. I hate that the trust is gone, and the resentment grows. If anyone has advice or a similar story of lost trust, I’d just love to hear and talk about it, if only to gain some perspective.

"My mother and her tragically unlucky family Hey, guys, I thought this was worth posting because I'm still totally gobsmacked at how unlucky and dysfunctional my mother's side of the family was, and it interests me because it sounds like a curse, when it was likely all just chance.  My mother was born in the late 50's, and it was my grandparents' third child, although she eventually had six siblings in the end (only two brothers are still alive). The way my auntie and uncles died, and how one turned out, creeps me out. So here we go;  So my mother used to have younger twin siblings - one boy and one girl - and my mother when she was four got into a serious car accident (grandfather was driving) so this would be 1962. She and my grandfather survived but her twin siblings didn't survive and both were tragically killed at the age of two.  But it gets unluckier.  So, a few years go by, my mother has two new little brothers at the time (let's call them George, born in 1963, and Alan, born a couple of years later)  1975, and again a tragic loss. My grandparents and family go through the loss of George, who, if you do the simple math, was only twelve when he died in a boat accident during a school trip. Apparently he jumped in the water to impress his friends while kayaking, and a boat later came speeding, didn't see him, and the front of it struck George's head. He drowned while unconscious because the teacher wasn't present (and apparently, he got in alot of shit for that).  But again, it gets unluckier.  Four years later, 1979, my grandfather, who was one of the bosses of a distribution warehouse, got into an accident during work. Wasn't told how, but it was fatal.  So during the late 70's leading up to my grandfather's death, my mother's two older brothers (let's name them Johnny and Frank, both in their twenties) end up doing drugs, although my uncle Frank apparently handled his habit better than Johnny. Uncle Johnny eventually moved onto injecting heroin, was stealing off family and friends until he got kicked out of my grandma's. He eventually disappeared from the family.  So 1983, after a couple years from last hearing of Johnny, my mother and her family receive news that a body found overdosed in a park four months prior, belonged to Johnny. Died at twenty-seven and wasn't identified for months by forensics. He was homeless and had nothing in possession to identify who he was.  So my grandma, who is now nearing ninety, is still going strong. Mentally and physically great besides just a walking stick. She lost four children at the ages of two, twelve, and twenty-seven. And a husband.  I never met any of them because this, of course, all happened before I was born.  The ones who are still here is Alan, Frank, and my mother. My uncle Alan turned out to be okay. Frank, on the other hand, now in his sixties, is an abusive alcoholic who lives in a crummy apartment with whoknows and has two kids he never sees. He turned down rehab many times but my grandma once told me that he drinks because he blames himself for what happened to Johnny, since he was the one who introduced him to drugs. But he hates us and wants nothing to do with the rest of his family anymore. I've only seen him four times in my life, and he was abusive on two occasions. One time when we went for a family meal when I was six, he ruined the night by abusing the resterant staff.  So my mother and uncle Alan are the only people out of seven kids who turned out to have positive lives. Depressing as fuck, isn't it?

"I feel trapped in a life I don't want to live. It took a lot of time for me to consider posting here but I'm gonna be alone for the whole day and can't deal with it. So, hi, I'm just your typical British kid dealing with the stresses of College but the problem is that I'm not stressed because of college (I don't really care much for it but it's better then work), I'm stressed because of this constant cycle of: wake up, spend an hour trying to get up, be 20 minutes late to everything every day, eat, browse the Internet and sleep.   All around me there's people who have clear career paths and know what they're passionate about, but I look at myself and realise that I don't have that. I have no interest in working in a job for the next 45 years of my life because there's nothing that I'd like doing. I'm doing fine in all of my classes (As in History and Cs in Maths, Distinctions in BTEC Engineering, everything just feels too simple) but I just still get these weeks where I feel worthless and pointless. I get brain fog, I end up teary eyed and can't talk to anybody for fear of looking stupid (I have speech problems). But then when I end up actually talking to others I apparently look happy.  I have spoken to people at my school about it, but it's the same thing every time. 'Oh you're struggling? We'll have a five minute conversation about your feelings and wait months to make sure you're not still sad'. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I stopped taking medication in July 2017 and haven't seen a doctor or therapist since. They didn't help, the medication I was on turned me into a god damn zombie and my therapist got exceptionally pissy at me for not telling the truth about my lack of improvement. I felt like I had to lie so I didn't waste their time and mine, I worry that's why I end up wearing a mask 90% of the time. Even around my family, who believe more in self-help then actually getting an actually decent therapist to try and help me. I'm ashamed to talk to them about it, no matter what anyone says, trust me when I say that they will NOT understand. I have been incredibly clear about it all and got mocked for it, some people just don't want to learn.  I had a pretty bad childhood that I try to justify my problems with (dealt with a lot of sexual abuse and my mother died in 2013) but when I'm having these 'days' I'm not thinking about anything in particular that would make me flighty. I ended up admitting a lot of my past to one teacher last week who I admire greatly and whom pretty much just saved my life and I am still cringing today. I know I have no reason to cringe either, I just get so nervous of social interaction.  I just don't get why the universe picked me to be its miserable little experiment. I never asked for anything bad to happen, I never asked to constantly feel tired and under the weather, I know that life isn't gonna be perfect but why is it that day after dull ass day I have to feel worse and worse? I try to take responsibility for my health, I feel like dirt, I have other people have some part in it and they take it for granted and hardly any of them actually make a big effort on me.   Sorry if my words are jumbled and rambled, I just needed a place to vent whilst I still can.",1,feel trapped life not want live took lot time consider posting gonna day deal it so hi just typical british kid dealing stress college problem not stressed college i not really care better work stressed constant cycle of wake up spend hour trying up minute late day eat browse internet sleep people clear career path know passionate about look realise not that working job year life like doing doing fine class a history c math distinction btec engineering just feel simple just week feel worthless pointless brain fog end teary eyed talk anybody fear looking stupid i speech problem end actually talking apparently look happy spoken people school it thing time oh struggling minute conversation feeling wait month make sure not sad diagnosed depression anxiety stopped taking medication july not seen doctor therapist since did not help medication turned god damn zombie therapist got exceptionally pissy not telling truth lack improvement felt like lie did not waste time mine worry end wearing mask time family believe selfhelp actually getting actually decent therapist try help me ashamed talk it matter say trust say not understand incredibly clear got mocked it people just not want learn pretty bad childhood try justify problem dealt lot sexual abuse mother died having wouldays not thinking particular make flighty ended admitting lot past teacher week admire greatly pretty just saved life cringing today know reason cringe either just nervous social interaction just not universe picked miserable little experiment asked bad happen asked constantly feel tired weather know life not gonna perfect day dull as day feel worse worse try responsibility health feel like dirt people granted hardly actually make big effort me sorry word jumbled rambled just needed place vent whilst can
" Cameron woke up at 4:00 a.m. from a strange noise coming from the kitchen. She thought it must have been Mrs. Chives from upstairs doing something. Cameron is a cautious girl, so she got up to check it out, just in case. She grabbed her pepper spray from the drawer of her bedside table and slowly walked towards the kitchen door. She pushed the door half way open, quietly, and stuck her head inside. She looked around the kitchen, but didn't see anything. Being annoyed by the whole ordeal, she dragged herself back to bed. She almost fell asleep again, untill she heard someone humming at the end of the hallway, with a woman's voice. Cameron is also a very down-to-earth girl, so she tried to find a reasonable explenation for it... it's like a reflex. ""Maybe someone is lost or something..."" she said to herself in a trembling voice. The humming sound kept getting louder and more intence, and the room got a bit cold. Her bedroom door was half open, and the only thing that lit up the room a bit was the moonlight, shining through the window. She kept staring at the hallway and breathing heavily, listening to the humming sound. She thought of asking who it is, but she wasn't that bold. Out of the darkness from the hallway, she could see two bright red eyes... she just sat up on her bed and had her eyes wide open. She didn't know what to do, so she panicked. She closed her eyes tight and tried to convince herself that it was just a dream. As soon as she opened them, she saw a shadowy figure standing at the foot of her bed, with the bright red eyes. It whispered something to her, but she couldn't understand it, mostly because she was terrified and extremely anxious. It reached over to Cameron's face, and she could see it's hand in the moonlight, it was as white as snow. Before she could do anything, her window opened and someone jumped inside! The figure with the red eyes turned, facing the other person. It started hissing, and it vanished in thin air. Cameron couldn't believe her eyes!      Who is that someone who saved her?   Did you like my story so far??? If you want to find out who that person is and what that creature was doing there, read my next post!!! ;) ",0,cameron woke am strange noise coming kitchen thought mr chive upstairs doing something cameron cautious girl got check out just case grabbed pepper spray drawer bedside table slowly walked kitchen door pushed door half way open quietly stuck head inside looked kitchen did not anything annoyed ordeal dragged bed fell asleep again untill heard humming end hallway woman voice cameron downtoearth girl tried reasonable explenation it like reflex maybe lost something said trembling voice humming sound kept getting louder intence room got bit cold bedroom door half open thing lit room bit moonlight shining window kept staring hallway breathing heavily listening humming sound thought asking is not bold darkness hallway bright red eye just sat bed eye wide open did not know do panicked closed eye tight tried convince just dream soon opened them saw shadowy figure standing foot bed bright red eye whispered her not understand it terrified extremely anxious reached cameron face hand moonlight white snow anything window opened jumped inside figure red eye turned facing person started hissing vanished air cameron not believe eye saved her did like story far want person creature doing there read post

"Cousin cutting off family. So my cousin has stopped talking to any of our family including his mother and brother. I just assumed it was just life getting in the way, but recently my dad tried to contact this cousin about some money he loaned him to buy my old car (which I sold to him well under half of market value), because my dad needed the money to pay for a surgery (he has stage 4 liver cirrhosis). My cousin never replied and money aside I can tell this really hurt my dad (he's bottling it, but I can tell) considering this is my Dad's favorite nephew. I feel like this is my cousin throwing a bit of a tantrum over having to be an adult (he just barely turned 19) and I texted him to call me when got off work to explain how serious my fathers illness is (our grandma died of the same condition) and how he shouldn't cut off his uncle who has done a lot for him, but it's been 3days already. My main motivation for this is that I know stage 4 cirrhosis can move to end stage very suddenly and I want my dad to have as few regrets and worries during what may be God forbid his last few years. I just wanted to talk about this. Advice is very welcome and before anyone suggests he doesn't have the money, he does, he just sold the car we sold him for above market value and has a very good paying job as a mechanic at a car dealership.",0,cousin cutting family cousin stopped talking family including mother brother just assumed just life getting way recently dad tried contact cousin money loaned buy old car which sold half market value dad needed money pay surgery he stage liver cirrhosis cousin replied money aside tell really hurt dad he bottling it tell considering dad favorite nephew feel like cousin throwing bit tantrum having adult he just barely turned texted got work explain father illness our grandma died condition not cut uncle lot him day already main motivation know stage cirrhosis end stage suddenly want dad regret worry god forbid year just wanted talk this advice welcome suggests doe not money doe just sold car sold market value good paying job mechanic car dealership

" I had nothing to say about this writing. It comes suddenly in my mind but it also because something has happens during that day.  I know what I am, who am I. I can’t be myself even it’s me somehow. Confused rite?? I want changing. I want to change my life.  This day something happens. For the moment I want to screammm.. and cry but I can’t. Why?? I forget how to cry anymore. What’s wrong with me?? Why I can’t overcome myself. It’s that fear that I scared. You asked me what the hell do I want?? I don’t know anymore. I just like normally people, want everything. But why I can’t?? Is that my fault?? Am I that boring?? But I supposed I also have that kind of chances right??  Flash back. We just met a few months ago. I thought we could be a good friend. But now I realize that just a dream, sweet dream. I am just realizing that there is no chemistry between you and me. I never enjoyed when I with you. Is that because of the chemistry?? I think yes because no matter what I say, what I do it’s wrong in your eyes. Am I really that clumsy?? I wonder do I really look like that?? Why I can’t overcome myself. It’s that fear that I scared. Can I let go my fear?? Oh God, I never asked you anything. I just want to be loved. Is that wrong?? Am I asking too much??  Oh please someone tell me what am I supposed to do. I am also a human too. I need love and loved someone. Do I have any options left behind?? I think answer of all this question is giving me a time to change. Change into what?? Do not ever dream that I would ever beg you to come back or kneel on my knee. Tell you I have my pride and I won’t let you pity on me. No matter what, I will survive. I am not asking you to come back I just wonder.. Have I done something wrong??  You once said that I am too kind. Is that wrong to be kind?? What’s wrong with that?? I don’t understand. Is that making you sick?? And I want to know what’s wrong to wear mask and to be somebody else who is better than me. Even it’s not me but now its parts of me now. I thought what the most important is just do whatever you think is right. I don’t care what people say about me. Let them say anything they like. Makes them happy. Or are they jealous with me?? I wonder.. Outside I might seem perfect and happy but don’t judge the book by its cover. No body’s perfect so am I. So what do you think of me now??

" I'm mentally preparing myself for my journy into Western Psyche. I told myself that Monday, one week from the last time I went, I would return.  So I now wonder what this will be like now.  Seeing her again.  I did blow her off. But I have just given myself the time I needed to get my mind back in order. This one week crawled by.  Seemed like an eternity.  I woke up this morning.  A gagging noise, then a forced heave as I stared blankly at the ceiling.  Too scared to move.  Then a surryingoff and the patter of  little kitten feet.  I knew that my cat threw up on my damn bed. I slid my feet up, and boldly looked down.  Yes indeed, but not just a small pile, a stream across the whole quilt.  At least four feet long.  That was it.  I just got up. 6:30 AM.  Went downstairs and watched All in the Family recordings.  Damn funny show at times.    I am falling deeper and deeper in love with Sarah Vowell.  I learned a few days ago that she is an Athiest.

"My bestfriend ruined my life. So, I am a 21 year old girl. I go to college, it's my third year and it all started two, almost three years. This girl, my ""best friend"" told me that her old friends from primary school came to see her and she invited me. I rejected it. I am very shy and anxious around people and she knew it. They were both boys, one of them being her old love interest and one of them... well. My future love interest, the man I thought my future. I've never been in a relationship, like I've said my depression and anxiety made me believe that I am not worth it and nobody is going to love me. So she asked that he wants to meet with me and how he can do that etc. I wanted to give my number to him, I told her that I would love to talk with him because she told me a lot about him. A basketball player -my favorite sports-, goes to San Francisco State University, loves motorcycles -like me- and wears all black -like me- and has blue eyes, dark hair etc. She told me that he doesn't use any social media, even his phone because he hated them as a kid too. I was like okay it's a oersonal preference. Like, at this point I wasn't serious. Because I didn't think he would like me. So I said let's try to talk with him because someone like him wouldn't like me anyway.   On my 19th birthday I got an e-mail.  It was from him.   He was telling me happy birthday, how he wanted to write me and meet me. I was stupid, I flew with his message and we started talking. It was so beautiful. He was so sweet and kind. He was everything I wanted. Times go by, we decide to try ""us"" in a relationship. Mind you, until then I haven't seen him once, even though I asked to see his face. Not because I only care about physical stuff, because it was too good to be true. My mind, my mind wasn't accepting the fact that someone like him would like me.   We started dating, talking each other 24/7 but without any Skype or calling. I haven't heard his voice once. One year passed, I totally fell in love, he told me he was in love and because of his family problems he couldn't open himself.   Few things ruined me after our magical but almost ""it's nothing but a dream"" year.  First he lied to me about visiting me 3 times. He told me that he gor the ticket and he was on the way to the airport. He never came.  Second time I cried my heart out because of an accident. We were talking with my ""bestie"" the girl who met us, and she send me a conversation quotes. Her argument with one of her friends. When he sent an e-mail... The exact conversation she sent me was on the bottom of his mail. We used to send tons of hearts with each mail, I guess she forgot copying the hearts again. And sent me the conversation.  Third time he decided to talk on Kik. You know after almost 1.5 years I wanted to speak normally, not with e-mails. I was so happy, I forgot everything he did to me, especially the mental abuse and fights about my male friends,  I said yes  open yourself to me, let me be with you etc. I was happy. A message came to me from an account with his initials. However without me having a chance to look at the message a notification about my bestie appeared on my phone, let's name her ""Aurora"" about opening a Kik account with his initials. I asked her what the fuck was going on and she told me it was a joke.  He never send a message from Kik.   Over time, my mental position got worse and worse. I'd hurt myself regularly, I'd cry at nights and I'd walk around without any emotions.  Our friendship whit my ""bestie"" did end before me and he ended. When she got a new phone, her e-mail app gave an error. Until she fixed it he didn't mail me even once. Fourteen days. When her phone got fixed, he started writing me immediately.   I knew it was her. I knew it was her from the beginning but I was too hopeful to believe that someone would love me. Now I'm here, with tons ıf new friends, friends I've made after her i, because her rude actions and poisonous words left us alone in the class. However I cannot deal with it. I still hope that he was real. I cannot stand the idea about a HUMAN BEING can do such a thing to a person she called as friend. I cannot deal with it. I would love to have some advice. It's been 2 weeks since my second semester has started but I cannot go to school because she will be there. And I am afraid I may hurt myself or worse, I may hurt her at some point.

"Did I do the right thing? Hello,reddit.First of all,I want to begin this by saying that English isn't my first language,so please do forgive me if I make mistakes here and there. Let's get straight to the point: I'm in highschool,10th grade.I've known my ''best friend'' since 1st grade.Y'know,it was that kind of nice,pleasant friendship,I was always there for her,she was always there for me,even travelling togheter,laughing with tears,told me many times that I'm her only ''true friend'' etc etc... and everything seemed to be alright...until she got a boyfriend.  She started to ignore,even get mad me me as to why I don't text it first..well,why does it matter so much who texts first? Seems like a childish thinking in my opinion.I told her that I can't be the only person that talks in this friendship,so she told me she'll text me first.She never did,but I saw it coming anyway. I realized that for her, it did not matter whether I am next to her or not.She is  so apathetic,almost to the point where it hurted me.But I decided to let go,focus more on myself,study more,read more,invest in my own hobbies and so on,so forth.As I was doing these,I started learning more things about myself,discovering things I didn't know about until now.And all of these happened,because I decided to leave her.She noticed this behaviour of mine and actually started talking to me,but it wouldn't matter anyway because it was an endless cycle.All she sees now is her boyfriend,I think the only reason she goes to school is just to see him,nothing else. As I look back at our past [which is,kind of,sorta tragic and I don't want to into detail],I realized that I was the only one who truly cared.I always cried for her,I wonder if she cried for me,at least once?She blocked on me on our social medias for the stupidest reasons [She thought I was annoyed because she was talking too much about her boyfriend] and somehow I was but I didn't want to show it..but what did she accomplish by blocking me for almost a month,anyway? Couldn't she talk to me about it,at least? I told her in the most sincere way that I missed her very much through that period of time and even started worrying,crying in the middle of the night.Her response was short and dry,as usual. I got fed up,starting to blame myself because I always accepted all of her bullshit.I broke our friendship,leaving her confused and perhaps angry at me. [I just started ignoring her and she noticed this]. Did I do the right thing?

"An Open Letter Dear you,  It's been three years since we decided to go our separate ways. We both had different goals, desires and aspirations. We were perfect together, but just at the wrong time.  I'm sorry things ended badly. I'm sorry that for months after they spiraled out of control. I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I let you down, your family down. I'm sorry I buckled. I'm sorry I didn't have the experience or the know-how to react to certain situations.  I'm sorry that I made mountains out of molehills. I'm sorry at times I treated you badly, that at times I held you back.  Three years later, we live totally different lives than back then. I got that job. I traveled the world. I went to Italy - twice. I've been to Times Square at midnight, and so have you. I did it all, but by myself. It's not what I wanted. It's not what I envisioned.   You can't just replace somebody special with another person, and that you were. Special.   It's been three years. Despite some triumphs and successes, it still feels like I lost a war. An immense failure that didn't personify my persona, it personified myself.   On the surface, I'm told I seem ambitious, fully ready to attack each day. On the inside, I feel defeated.   In the end, you found somebody new, which is fine. I chose, whether consciously or unconsciously to stay on a different path. I've tried new women. Many beautiful on the outside, but they aren't you. Oh no, no, no. They all don't have what you had.   Not even close.  Maybe one day I will end this crusade against myself, against the past. I can't change it, I can't alter the story, I can't lie to myself.  I wish I could tell you I'm sorry. But it wouldn't change anything. For you it's a battle that was fought long ago. For me, I relive it more times than I'd care to admit.  I'm emotionally crippled, distraught, defeated. It's been a long three years.   I'm ready for it to be over.  I'm sorry.  Yours truly,  Me.

" Stuff goes nuts as soon one gets mad.  As if somehow civility is erased from our brains and mindless matter comes out of our mouths.  Blows thrown at breakable things as if relief of someones frustration is inevitable.  Things twist as a tale changes and turns from moderate to worse.  My wife begged me to let her go her parents house,  while I shaked my head in disapproval.  So I said ""ill make you a deal, I let you go but you clean the house tomorrow.  And get everything ready to go...and I mean everything! including me! get my clothes ready."" As time progressed somehow my wife lost track of time.  Then the time came for me to get ready to go to work.  My stuff wasnt ready as we agreed.  I let my wife know that im about to leave and im not taking her to her moms house.  She gets mad and storms out of the room while screaming  "" I have RIGHTS!!""  me thinking to myself.. ""Fuck man... I have the right to enforce what we had agreed on.""  The arguments got worse as she decided to resolve to threats of what she wasnt gonna do anymore. Of course that incensed me beyond borders of sanity as I thought on my head ""hey its not my fault you took forever in getting ready!!"" We went off to work and she dropped me off.  When the time came for me to come out of work she wasnt outside waiting for me.  I asked around if anybody had a cell phone to call my wife, and apparently nobody did.  So I waited 20 minutes till the next batch of employees came out, and asked them for a cellphone.  My wife answered to my dismay! I asked ""why are you not picking me up!""  She said ""You usually dont come early home so I figured you were gonna take a long time to get out.""  That got me so angry that I almost hit the windshield of my car.  She said ""I have RIGHTS!"" Infuriated as I was I struck the windshield and cracked it."" I was disappointed, but oh well its my wifes fault!!.  Of course I left alot of details out since im so angry right now that its consuming me from within.  It burns me inside as my spirit of goodwill fades into unusefullness.  What a shitty day.

I have just discovered that my best friend spent many months telling my coworkers that my relationship was illegitimate, that I was only dating him because I pitied him for his looks, and that my fiance and I were really just platonic friends but that I agreed to get married out of desperation. (To be clear, none of this is true - although others do find him to be unattractive in a conventional sense, I did not. She was projecting.) As a result, as I have now learned, my LEGITIMATE relationship became a workplace joke, and everyone has been mocking me and my fiance behind our backs for a year, including my bosses. This also includes people who I excitedly called after getting engaged and people that I had offered positions in my wedding party to. To make things worse, the fact that the relationship ended is being blamed on me being shallow about his appearance and is being used as vindication for these rumors. Not that it matters, but it ended for a plethora of deeply ingrained and painful issues, none of which were in any way related to appearance.  I feel so betrayed by this friend that I can't imagine ever reconciling. I am preparing to completely cut her from my life and just want to know if others would do the same, or if I'm overreacting to average workplace drama.",0,ending friendship overreacting looking advice impartial people little background information recently went nasty split fiance year relationship him dividing issue solid just discovered best friend spent month telling coworkers relationship illegitimate dating pitied look fiance really just platonic friend agreed married desperation to clear true unattractive conventional sense did not projecting result learned legitimate relationship workplace joke mocking fiance back year including boss includes people excitedly called getting engaged people offered position wedding party to make thing worse fact relationship ended blamed shallow appearance used vindication rumor not matter ended plethora deeply ingrained painful issue way related appearance feel betrayed friend imagine reconciling preparing completely cut life just want know same overreacting average workplace drama

"I think I'm in an abusive friendship and I don't know what to do. One of my close friends with borderline has been constantly reinforcing and triggering my social anxiety. Everything is apparently all my fault, always, Apparently everyone (whatever that means) says I'm nuts, Im controlling, blah blah. She tried to rediagonse my depression as a narcissistic personality disorder. There's a laundry list of things that have been said to me. It's making me feel useless and sad and reinforcing the notion that no matter how hard I try I will never be good enough, that maybe I deserve to be alone, etc.  I feel like I'm going to have to either let her continue to talk to me like this or stand up for myself and lose her as a friend. While the latter option gives me the peace of mind to think it's not me, that I had enough self worth to stand up for myself and not cave to my friends abusive reinforcement, I really don't want to lose her as a friend. I just don't know what to do, she usually doesn't listen to me anyways. I don't know, maybe I am just a dirtbag.  Does anyone have any thoughts as to how to get out of this cycle?",1,think abusive friendship not know do close friend borderline constantly reinforcing triggering social anxiety apparently fault always apparently whatever mean say nut im controlling blah blah tried rediagonse depression narcissistic personality disorder laundry list thing said me making feel useless sad reinforcing notion matter hard try good enough maybe deserve alone etc feel like going let continue talk like stand lose friend option give peace mind think not me self worth stand not cave friend abusive reinforcement really not want lose friend just not know do usually doe not listen anyways not know maybe just dirtbag doe thought cycle
" So I didn't get around to posting more earlier as I expected....I'll get better.  I'm now over halfway done with my marathon summer semester.  I never took Physics in high school.  Not sure how I passed Chemistry my junior year.  But, for now, I'm doing well in Physiology.  I'm loving it!  Science is cool.  I spent the last 20+ years fearing references to science and now I want to go out of my way to read or watch them.    Admittedly I have changed over the past year or so.  A life crisis (as opposed to a mid-life crisis which I am not old enough to have yet) let me to decide I want to go into nursing.  To do that I have to plunge into science.  Now I find its not bad.  Where did I get the impression it was?  The larger question in my mind is what happens in our schools that so many children and teens like myself end up hating science?  Can something be done to change that.  Everyone has different interests; be they theater, media, science, athletic or something else.  However, shouldn't our schools foster at least an interest or respect for all areas?  With obesity increasingly an issue athletics are important.  Science technology is equally important.  What would life be without music or theater?  In the rush to standardize test I think we are missing the large point problem.  It is that kids should enjoy school.  We have all had good teachers who make learning fun.  As a society we need to study those teachers and start pushing for more like them.

"My Mom shot herself. Hi forum, I am going through alot right now and have no idea what to do. I will tell you the story, its a long one.. I hope you are willing to read.  I am 32 years old, I was very close to my mother.. We had a bond that was as strong as steel. My dad whom she was with since the age of 15 left her 11 years ago for another woman and found happiness. She had never been with any other man. I have an older sister that is 42 and we had different relationships. My mother was angry and could never get over my dad, year after year we would hear how much she hated him but still loved him, she would wish they could be one again. It never happened, she had been with no one and remained lonley for 11 years. Her depression became her life, it was so bad we would stop talking to her because all she would talk about is killing herself and how she hated my dad. 10 years of it, She had little money and was very sick, She went from healthy to brittle in a matter of 10 years. Back surgery's, aching bones, depression, pain pain and more pain. It became up to me and my sister to take care of her, she couldn't drive so we always had to drive over to take her to the dr, groceries or to get things she needed, it became stressfull and we would somtimes bicker over it..even after the divorce my dad helped when he wanted to or could.  She started thinking she was a burden.. then started lashing out on us at times, I went a whole year not speaking to her until she called me to apologize for her horrible words with me. I forgave her and we began a relationship again...this time it was amazing again, we got along and finally after 10 years she accepted my partner. Long story short drama hit the fan again in early Nov this year. Things were said between her and my sister and they got me involved, I got upset with my mom and she was so hurt and thought that I thought she was a liar. My sister told me she said something about my son that she claimed she didn't. I didn't care after a while, I had plans with her on the day before thanksgiving to go see her.. on the 19th of NOV. She asked on the 19th if i could come hook up her VCR so she could watch A Christmas Story, I told her next weekend, then she later that night got upset again, she texted all of us the usual suicide talk. I had told her the day before that I didn't want anymore drama, if i went over with my family I didn't want to hear about my dad and sister. I just wanted to have a good time. She then texted me and a lot of other family that she loved me. that it wasn't my fault, she bought the gun... (I took her to get that gun for protection so I always told her if she did that I would feel to blame) She would say "" SON I bought it! Dont feel to blame"" I hated that! Still I never belived she would do it.. I was so bitter about her not wanting to be possitive I hadent called her. I ignored her suicide text and just decided to let her cool off.. 20th, 21st-29th we hadnt spoken.. I had a bad feeling but didnt know why.. she hadnt called.. so i figured she was angry with me.. I get a call from my aunt on my dads side who she was very close with.. ""Is it true? The rumors about your mom?"" I was picking up my kids from school.. I said ""huh? what she say about me this time hahaha?"" ""Call your sister"" she said.. I called and she told me to go home right away.. Then she said when getting home "" Mom... mom... *cries*... Moms dead.. she killed herself"" I said ""dont say that"" about 12 times breaking down more and more each time I repeated it.. I fell apart crying for who know how long... day one was hard, day two was harder, day 3 was numb and empty and I couldn't cry or sleep, day 4 I then hit a new horrible moment.. I found out she had been in her apartment dead since the 20th.. the complex lied and said no one heard anything and thats another story.. they are being sued soon.. her body was in there so long that we will not have an open casket this week in her funeral.. Then i went into her apartment to start gathering her things.. i smelled the death and decay.. I have never felt so sick and horrified in my life. I will never forget it.. i went to where she did it and saw the carpet cut out and her bed gone.. her place was left just like I last saw it.. it killed me.. I am now on day 6 and her ceremony is tomorrow in her home town.. Idk what to think or feel anymore.. my wife is trying to support me cause her mom died when she was 17 but i am changing.. She can see it, I dont want to run my company, I dont sleep, I have this numb feeling.. I cry out of no where.. I can not stop picturing her lifeless body, I cant stop thinking ""was she in pain?"" picturing her bleed out her exit wound for over a week.. I cry and can not stop.. I feel like dying.. I feel so empty and full of rage.. I wounder why she left me here..  I wish I could of took it back, I feel its my fault I should have went over or called.. My phone had got disconnected on the 19th but I had a home phone, she said ""I wish you could talk to me on the phone I love you""... I hate myself so much I hate myself!! I just can only think how I could have saved her.. I miss my mom.. I miss her so much! I dont feel I can cope.. Im sorry for your loss... im so sorry... welp.. shes in a better place.. STFU!!! Im so angry.. I wish I was a better person I wish I would of took her serious .. I can only listen to her voice mails ranting and raving how much she loves me.. I can read her text after all the times we hung out and had fun... I got my mom back after a year of not talking for only 2 and a half months... 2 and a half months of my mom loving my partner, getting along with me and having positive moments..

" this title is more of what i am looking for than what i am offering. i was looking for a way to start some good conversations on this topic but was unsure as to where i should go to do so....until now. so, that is what i am wondering. personally, i think that for the most part, the church has missed the point over the last 500 years or so but this has become more evident in recent years, as illustrated by this excerpt from ""Blue Like Jazz"":       ""In a recent radio interview I was sternly asked by the host, who did not consider himself a Christian, to defend Christianity. I told him that I couldn’t do it, and moreover, that I didn’t want to do defend the term. He asked me if I was a Christian and I told him yes. “Then why don’t you want to defend Christianity?” he asked, confused. I told him I no longer knew what the term meant. Of the hundreds of thousands of people listening to his show that day, some of them had terrible experiences with Christianity, they may have been yelled at by a teacher in a Christian school, abused by a minister, or browbeaten by a Christian parent. To them, the term Christianity meant something that no Christian I know would defend. By fortifying the term, I am only making them more and more angry. I won’t do it. Stop ten people on the street and ask them what they think of when they hear the word Christianity and they will give you ten different answers. How can I defend a term that means ten different things to ten different people? I told the radio show host that I would rather talk about Jesus and how I came to believe that Jesus exists and that he likes me. The host looked back at me with tears in his eyes. When we were done, he asked me if we could go get lunch together. He told me how much he didn’t like Christianity but how he had always wanted to believe Jesus was the son of God.""    i am not saying that i disagree with the teaching of Jesus nor with that of the Bible but rather with the fundamental ring-wing Christianity of the 20th century. what are your thoughts on christian spirituality?

"I think i might be depressed , even when i'm having an ok life , is it possible? I'll try to keep this as short as possible , no one likes a wall of text .   Just as the tittle said , is it possible or i'm just seeing it all wrong?  Summary : I'm a 19 years old dude , NEET at the moment , life was never hard or cruel to me . Don't have many friends but all the friends i have are delightful to me , also my family puts no pressure on me and they are pretty positive overall . The only trauma i experienced so far was the breakup with my ex , but i moved on totally forgot about her . Just an ordinary life in general   But yet , i can't help but notice the subtle changes of my outlook , and in how i feel about life . I was 100% happy-go-lucky my entire life until the end phase of 2015 , but then something happened . Not sure when or why , because looking back nothing real bad happened to me , yet i started to feel more and more indifferent as each day passes . At one point i even stopped contacting people around me because i was like ""talk is ok but no talk is ok too"" , and even today i still feel that way .   I still feel joy and moods in life , like eating good food , cry from very sob movies , but at the end of the day there's always something , it isn't feeling the same like how i had felt my entire life . I think it might be because i have no dreams or passions like other folks in my life , but i was always like that and i was always fully content with it .  On a positive note , good thing is i don't have any suicidal thoughts .",1,think depressed having ok life possible try short possible like wall text just tittle said possible just seeing wrong summary year old dude neet moment life hard cruel not friend friend delightful family put pressure pretty positive overall trauma experienced far breakup ex moved totally forgot just ordinary life general help notice subtle change outlook feel life happygolucky entire life end phase happened not sure looking real bad happened started feel indifferent day pass point stopped contacting people like talk ok talk ok too today feel way feel joy mood life like eating good food sob movie end day not feeling like felt entire life think dream passion like folk life like fully content positive note good thing not suicidal thought
"Hello All, I'm a 27 year old female from PA. I've been dealing with severe depression since my early 20's. I recently had two friends tell me that they think I may be bipolar. Hmm I'll have to disagree. I don't really have ""highs."" At least not anymore. Mostly just feel like blah. Sometimes it's so bad I think things would be better if I wasn't around. I would never commit suicide, but it doesn't stop the thoughts from clouding my head. I've had the therapy and been on medicines... celexa, paxil, combo of celexa and lamictal, lexapro, wellbutrin. NOTHING. I'm not taking anything right now, but am in the process of looking for a new therapist as my insurance recently changed. This sucks. Most of the time I feel nothing. Empty. I find it easier to get emotional and cry over a stupid TV show than over something in real life. Well, it's good to be here. Hopefully it'll help.",1,hello all year old female pa dealing severe depression early is recently friend tell think bipolar hmm disagree not really high not anymore just feel like blah bad think thing better not around commit suicide doe not stop thought clouding head therapy medicine celexa paxil combo celexa lamictal lexapro wellbutrin nothing not taking right now process looking new therapist insurance recently changed suck time feel nothing empty easier emotional stupid tv real life well good here hopefully help
"Sick and tired of my family and my sister's fiance So what I'm about to share is a very, very long story so I'll try to shorten it without leaving out too much info for better context of the situation.   My fiance, we've been together for 3 years, is currently in basic training. There were a few rough patches before he left, partly due to the fact that he wanted to get married before leaving. I love him to death and I know he wanted to get married to get the benefits started but I didn't want to base our marriage off of benefits. I know it won't be and I know he wants to do his best to help us. When I asked why he joined, he said one of the main reasons is to provide more for us and to take care of me, which I'm grateful for but I never wanted him to feel like it was all on his shoulders. That's why we planned to move out towards the end of the year and why I'm on college, to be independent, have stability and create my identity.  Now for background info, my fiance and I have been living with my sister and her fiance along with our younger brother; our brother has Autism.  Our mother lost the house due to her opioid addiction and we found a place for us to rent together. Our dad left the state the summer before my senior year of high school. So as always my sister and i pick up the pieces and make sure our brother is taken care of. We all have been living together for almost 3 years. Since we've moved into our most recent house, it has been a shit show. 100% of the drama that occurs in the house is due to her fiances family and they don't even live or pay any bills here! Surprisingly after a year of being here they've calmed down but my fiance and I are tired of it. Also I need the ability to live my life and grow as an individual. Having to hold back and set aside my needs and wants is getting tiresome. I barely even want to have children of my own because ive been a parent to my own brother. I don't feel comfortable where I'm at now, I feel like I'm only here because it is convenient, I don't feel appreciated at all. I know my sister wants to keep the family together, or what little we have left but I need room to breathe. Also when I was 16 her fiance offered oral sex to me, I know I should have told her but I also knew she wouldn't have believed me especially given that he is her first everything. I still feel uncomfortable  around him at times.   My sister cares and trys her best. She wants to buy a house and move down to Texas, that's where we used to live before pcsing to Washington state. I understand the position she was put in, we both had to endure the chaos that was our family these last few years, well since I was in the 8th grade really. However, her goals and mine don't align and I don't feel like compromising those for anyone else anymore.   My fiance and I just want some peace and the ability to deal with our own problems, in peace without hearing people argue in the next room. We had a plan to move out towards the end of the year but he didn't want to wait. He was even going to school, he had started his first quarter. I asked him to consider the reserves because he could go to school and when he's done move on to active duty but with him being so stubborn he went active.   It's not that I never wanted him to join, my father served 22 years and I want to join as well. I'll support him for however long his career will be but now I'm trying to figure out how do I move on and start my own family. Not that it'll  include children right away, but just my fiance and I.   When we get married he will be my priority and my family as well, I just don't want my sister thinking I've chosen him over them. But also I need to make decisions for myself. Just about every decision I've made has always needed me to make sure I'm available for other people. I'm tired of always being available. My sister sometimes acts as if she takes care of our brother on her own but that is far from the truth. We've both had to do the same and yet I don't think she really appreciates it, at least she won't until I move with my fiance.   I'm not sure if many of you are familiar with this term but enmeshment is the term I'd use to describe my family. There is no boundaries and if you deviate from their mean then you're an oddball.   I know I said I'd try to keep it short and this isn't even half of it. I want and going to move with my fiance after I've graduated and we are married. He's getting deployed after OSUT, so I'm thinking it'll be best to get married after and itll keep some stress away from having to worry about doing before he leaves.   I appreciate anyone that takes the time to read this, advice is greatly appreciated.",0,sick tired family sister fiance share very long story try shorten leaving info better context situation fiance year currently basic training rough patch left partly fact wanted married leaving love death know wanted married benefit started did not want base marriage benefit know not know want best help u asked joined said main reason provide care me grateful wanted feel like shoulder planned end year college independent stability create identity background info fiance living sister fiance younger brother brother autism mother lost house opioid addiction place rent together dad left state summer senior year high school sister pick piece make sure brother taken care of living year moved recent house shit show drama occurs house fiance family not live pay bill here surprisingly year calmed fiance tired it need ability live life grow individual having hold set aside need want getting tiresome barely want child ive parent brother not feel comfortable now feel like convenient not feel appreciated all know sister want family together little left need room breathe fiance offered oral sex me know told knew not believed especially given everything feel uncomfortable time sister care try best want buy house texas used live pcsing washington state understand position in endure chaos family year th grade really however goal not align not feel like compromising anymore fiance just want peace ability deal problem peace hearing people argue room plan end year did not want wait going school started quarter asked consider reserve school active duty stubborn went active not wanted join father served year want join well support long career trying figure start family not include child right away just fiance i married priority family well just not want sister thinking chosen them need make decision myself just decision needed make sure available people tired available sister act take care brother far truth not think really appreciates it not fiance not sure familiar term enmeshment term use family boundary deviate mean oddball know said try short not half it want going fiance graduated married getting deployed osut thinking best married itll stress away having worry doing leaf appreciate take time read this advice greatly appreciated
" Well this will be my first entry. Here goes.... I'm 27 and I feel like I'm going on 80. I have a huge cat and an amazing boyfriend and we all live happily together. The only imperfect thing about my Prince Charming is, He has not asked ""the"" question yet. Officially we have lived together for 1 year and including that time we have been together 1 year and 9 months. I really want to be married to him. More than anything ever. We have never fought and he doesn't annoy me. Even when he doesn't load the dishwasher correctly. I want to have a baby or two and live happily ever after. I'm not really that naive, but that is what I want. Before this one I was in a relationship that, although I'm glad it ended, was supposed to be a marriage. And when My current boyfriend (lets call him ""JB"") JB and I decided to move in together he was aware of my desire for marriage and told me he wouldn't move in if that's not where he thought we were headed. I made a deal with myself that if he did ask within a year then he is OUT. Well, I know it's hard to believe but he really is practically perfect. When I hear friends discuss the stupid, thoughtless, even rude crap their boyfriends do it just makes JB's halo shine brighter. It takes time right? There is no time limit on love....Right??? No, really, I want someone to tell me to relax. It's hard to decide whether or not to stick around and wait for a proposal or find someone who is less who I want and just get married so I can start a family. I feel like I have to choose between a GREAT guy or having kids (the bio-clock is a tickn' and I ain't gettin' younger).

"Little sister has depression, what do I do? As the title says my baby sister has depression and I heard from my boyfriend this subreddit gives him support. I just discover the past summer that my little sister (14) has depression and is now cutting her self with razor blades. I warned my mother that I read her diary and she was counting calories first in September. Earlier this week I told her to keep an eye on her cause I think she is depressed, btw I live in another continent at home and thus have limited access on how much I see them. My mom said she will keep an eye to see if she is cutting herself or not. We recently discovered that she does in deed and her circle of friends have depression too. She is being bullied as well by one guy at school and confidant has depression and is cutting himself as well.   She opened up to my parents and one of close friends who is a professional who works with children a lot, isn’t a psychologist.  My mom is very supportive as well as the rest of my family and we just want to help my little sister. My mom is not sure what to do, and neither am I. I suggested to look for professional help for her, as she is harming herself. However, we are not sure what to do about her surroundings. Most of her friends have depression and she is doing badly in school on top of that she is being bullied. What do you guys think? Change her of school and remove her from the toxic environment or leave her there and get her a psychologist?

"A Long Story So here’s the situation I was and still sort of am in a group of four friends (friends for about 3 years). One of our four was a new girl who we added to the group about half of a year ago. But a few weeks ago three of us pranked the new girl’s best friend, it did not go well and suddenly the NG stopped hanging out with our group (we hangout but mostly play games online).  But what I wouldn’t learn till the following week was that she wasn’t hanging out with me and rest of the group was hanging out her behind my back. They lied about having things to do, or saying the were simply to busy to spend time together. When we did hangout the other two and I they both acted odd and withdrawn, I attempted to dig into why and even asked if it specifically related to NG but I got backlash for doing so so I let up. However later I learned about her not wanting/being to hangout with me was a “intervention” where the three of them sat me down and told me that NG’s BF old her that She couldn’t be friends with me anymore because her BF told her that it was all my fault and she had to choose between me and her BF in addition I learned that why my friends had been harsh and avoided me earlier in the week, they had lied to me about the whole situation. They knew about the ultimatum that NG’s BF gave her the whole week and decided not to tell me till now, they claim it was to save my feelings but it didn’t come off that way. The “Intervention” ended with her leaving and me leaving as well.  The next couple of weeks are bad not only is our group divided, I am the odd man out they spend the bulk of their time with NG and ignore me for the most part. So I confront my two friends (one I’ve been friends with for five years and the other three), I tell them it’s unfair that I am getting the short end of this situation when she made the decision to break up the group, I also tell them that the fact that they were willing to lie and go behind my back is wrong and that they justify it by claiming that NG is the victim because she lost a friend (so did I). They have apologized for the lying and going behind my back but I told them that I don’t feel comfortable with them spending time with her and being friends with all the problems she caused me and their easy willingness to lie for her to me. They tell that they will always be friends with her and that I can’t ask them to cut her off because it would divide the group, even though she already divided the group by pushing me out and they did nothing about it as a matter of fact the backed her up and supported her decision. So I told them that I have too walk away from the group then because I don’t feel valued, respected, or able to trust them after what they have done.  Am I in the wrong? What should I do should I walk away? I don’t want to throw away my two closest friends but I feel like they don’t even care about me anymore.

"How to break up with my depressed/suicidal girlfriend? I’m in a tough position... I fell for a girl over 6 months ago and we’ve been dating since. It’s faded for me at least, and I don’t feel the same way I did at all, but from what she’s told me her feelings for me have only gotten stronger and we’ve already hit the “I love you” stage. I still care for her as a person and there’s nothing bad between us nor do we argue, but it’s just not what it was and I feel like I’ve needed to move on for the past 2-3 months. My issue with this is the fact that she’s both depressed and has been suicidal in the past (not things I knew off the bat, but learned towards the beginning). She has 1 real friend and a sibling she’s close to, but aside from that she doesn’t get along with her family. She’s told me before I’m really all she has, but not in a desperate way (although I think it is that too). I don’t really know how to tell her or what to be cautious of because this is the first time I’ve dated someone like this. I know it’s a shitty situation but I need to move on in a way that leaves her the least impacted or in the best way I can.

"Trying to start a dialogue with a friend and seeing it blow up in my face Hi Everyone,  First off, thank you to everyone here. I've been a long time reader but never posted. This is yet another post regarding a friend and the problems associated.  Basically, me and this guy have been friends since college, we're both in our mid-30s and entering into the next phase of our respective lives. We've always had a contentious friendship, many fights, many core disagreements, and often general dislike for one another. The solution to dealing with this has always been along the line of this: it's R, and he's an asshole, so what can you expect!  So the story in question goes like this... we're at a mutual friends wedding and he goes out of his way to ignore me and my gf, now my fiance, coming over to the group we were with and asking a question to a couple people then leaving, also practically walking by us without saying hi. It was only until I said something that he acknowledged us, which set my fiance up in flames. A few weeks later we got engaged and I texted all my friends, including R, individually with a semi copied/pasted message. It was short and sweet, but 100% honest. He doesn't reply, I left the country for vacation, and I never got his text. Turns out he did reply but more on that in a minute.   I was upset, I sent him an email that was part deconstructive to our friendship, partly selfish, but also completely honest. I told him my feelings, how I contemplated why he didn't respond but ultimately decided that i didn't care and that I didn't need someone in my life who was going to treat me that way. By telling him these were my feelings and repeating that I wanted him to realize I was upset and I wanted to open a discussion. I never said directly ""I don't want you as a friend"" or ""you're not invited to my wedding"" but that is what he took from it. I wanted to open a dialogue, but he got really upset and angry. Also turns out he did respond to my text, a week later and said that the original text never sent, but that since his wife is pregnant he wouldn't be able to make the wedding, which is completely fine with me because the wedding is in another country. I just hated his response, it was cold and not something a friend should send to another friend regarding a wedding.  I called him out and wanted to make him see that by my standards he was not acting like a friend, but also neither was I. I had not put much effort into the friendship either. But I did say that I wanted to say these things rather than say nothing with the hopes that we could find common ground and build a foundation for something to grow in the future, which he completely ignored.   I honestly have no idea what to do. I fear he is going to turn all our mutual friends against me, and I don't know how I am able to handle that, or if I can even handle that. My life is in a great place, but my friendships are shit, and that hurts more than I could ever imagine. To put more on top of it, his wife was having issues with a pregnancy, which he said were serious. But I heard from a mutual friend that he said she was fine. So I don't know how to react to that. I honestly don't know where to go from here. My fiance, my rock, my saving grace, is unfortunately traveling for work this month and really crazy busy. She owns her own business so it's important for her to pound the pavement and get sales, so I really don't want her to be burdened by my own bullshit.   I can send anyone the email discussion in a PDF if you want to read it. Hopefully someone can help.",0,trying start dialogue friend seeing blow face hi everyone off thank here long time reader posted post regarding friend problem associated basically guy friend college mids entering phase respective life contentious friendship fight core disagreement general dislike another solution dealing line this r asshole expect story question go like this mutual friend wedding go way ignore gf fiance coming group asking question couple people leaving practically walking saying hi said acknowledged u set fiance flame week later got engaged texted friend including r individually semi copiedpasted message short sweet honest doe not reply left country vacation got text turn did reply minute upset sent email deconstructive friendship partly selfish completely honest told feeling contemplated did not respond ultimately decided did not care did not need life going treat way telling feeling repeating wanted realize upset wanted open discussion said directly i not want friend you not invited wedding took it wanted open dialogue got really upset angry turn did respond text week later said original text sent wife pregnant not able make wedding completely fine wedding country just hated response cold not friend send friend regarding wedding called wanted make standard not acting like friend i not effort friendship either did say wanted say thing say hope common ground build foundation grow future completely ignored honestly idea do fear going turn mutual friend me not know able handle that handle that life great place friendship shit hurt imagine it wife having issue pregnancy said serious heard mutual friend said fine not know react that honestly not know here fiance rock saving grace unfortunately traveling work month really crazy busy owns business important pound pavement sale really not want burdened bullshit send email discussion pdf want read it hopefully help

"I willingly admit that I am a sufferer of depression. But in my case, I think the problem was education more than anything. I recognize that I have been depressed pretty much from as far back as I can remember. I'm not sure where I got the misinformation but I spent most of my life believing that it was just me, just life, you know, the thinking that some people were lucky and happy and I just wasn't. I'm 34 now so it is a wonder that I made it to this point, considering the statistics. I think that I tried to destroy myself in other ways like smoking and minor drugs and not taking care of myself. Basically I was waiting for things to either get better or finish falling apart. About a year ago, my new doctor recognized the symptoms in me and offered me help in the form of Zoloft and some counseling which changed my life. The problem then became that I changed jobs and lost my insurance with no hope of COBRA so I actually went of the drug cold turkey (highly not recommended, believe me) and am now back where I started.

"Driving back home from dropping my cousins off, I began to think about my future actions. I'm fully committed to this. I know that when I start, there's no going back. If I don't succeed, if this becomes a botched suicide attempt, there really will be no life after that. My parents will hate me. My friends will leave me or treat me with kid gloves. Either way, I suffer even more than I suffer now. It doesn't seem possible that my suffering can grow but I know that if I don't continue or succeed, it will. I honest to goodness don't know what's wrong with me. I mean, why do I have to feel like this? Nothing I've done to make things right with myself has helped. Things just keep getting worse for me.

"It's been so long since I've been here doubt anyone would remember me!  Lots has been happening.  My job has become busier so I've become more exhausted when I get home and I just don't want to do anything.  Then on March 4 my brother from my adopted mother died of a heart attack so had to go through that experience with my niece, his only daughter.  Then right after that my husband got really sick with pain in his belly.  We took him into emergency and they did a CT scan and could see only massive infection and couldn't tell where it was coming from.  So he was admitted and given antibiotics and scheduled for a colonoscopy.    He was also very low on potassium so he was given bags of potassium and taking pills on top of that.  His colon was clear so it was determined his gall bladder was diseased and needed to come out.  But right now it was so swollen and infected the surgeon wanted to wait until the infection cleared and swelling went down before he took it out.  So husband is now on a non-fat diet to reduce the swelling and still on antibiotics to clear out the infection.  Fortunately, being vegan, non - fat is not too hard for us to do.  He goes in for a pre - exam on Wednesday and then surgery a week later.  But through all this I haven't been doing my routing of medications and exercise and am suffering for it.  Fibro and migraines have hit me really hard.  I'm still trying to take care of my husband though by preparing his meals.  He lost almost 30 lbs through the last week of this whole episode.  In the meantime, I have an appointment Monday with a neurosurgeon to discuss if something needs to be done with my tethered spinal cord.  I've had it for years and it causes weakness in my legs and pins and needles in my feet.  It could also affect bladder and bowel functions but I haven't had that problem yet.   I've read that sometimes they cut the end of the spinal cord to get it out of the way of the vertebrae.  I'm not sure how serious my case is but my neurologist thought it was serious enough to send me to surgeons.  It's a rare birth defect I guess found in adults.  Usually they catch it in infants.

"Need honest opinions on my living situation. So about 6 months ago, my father had an accident which left him disabled. He lived in a 1 story ranch home. Being the only child that would be able to take care of my Dad, I moved my husband and 2 children to my dads house. Our house needed so much work, we wanted to sell it anyways, his house being 1 level worked so much better for him, allowed him to get around easier. So my father has gotten a little better, can take care of himself in the bathroom, needs helps with cleaning, cooking etc. also can’t drive. We are still living with my dad. The living situation has really worked out for us all. I am a stay at home mom, so taking care of my dad and 2 children is very much manageable. My husband and I do have our own space in the house as well. Sooo can someone please tell me why I’m so embarrassed to tell people of our living situation? Everyone knows what happened to my dad, everyone knows he needs me but I sort of feel like a failure. I guess because we don’t own our own house. We have done so much work and updating to my fathers house to make it our own. We pay almost all of the bills too.

"When people with good intentions say the wrong shit.. How do you deal with it? When someone who is just trying to help you says something that cuts you really deeply, or when they are pushing you when you just need them to back off while. How do you personally deal with it?   Recently I had an Uncle who I was close with get involved trying to help with my depression and anxiety issues. He encouraged me to go see a therapist again for the first time in years and was just there to talk and encourage. Then when he saw progress he started pushing more and more and I started getting really stressed. Then when I had a break down and started slipping back he took said some shit to me which really cut me deep. I stopped talking to him for a while after that. He said things that confirmed what I thought people in my family were thinking abou me.   Now the issue I'm facing. I don't feel justified in being angry at him because he was trying to help and he just got too excited at seeing progress that I had made many times before and then he got frustrated when it came to a halt. So now I just feel guilty at having the feelings and the anger turns inward and eats me up. But the anger and hurt don't go away from what he said either. It's been months and I just don't want to talk to or see him at all. He's reaching out again and I can't find the words to  explain the anger and hurt I feel, because I feel like I shouldn't be angry or hurt. So it's just a big spiral of anger and shame.   The worst part is I don't know of I can ever have the same relationship I had with him before. We were buddies. Even if I get over this I just don't know if the trust will ever be back. This makes me sad. I didn't really want him involved, but good intentions make it hard to tell people their help isn't wanted.

I talked to Luke about Chasen and he says to just tell him the truth about how I feel!  Yeah, well, even if I did tell him the truth he wouldn't believe me or take me back!

"Why is it so hard to just be empathetic? Today, I failed miserably at baking a key lime pie. Filling was way too loose, meringue wouldn't whip, crust cracked, just a terrible time overall. And then my mom comes over and instead of comforting me or something a normal human being would do, says ""Better luck next time,"" with the tone of a carny trying to get a six year old away from his ring toss booth. I got even more upset, and that seemed to genuinely confuse her.  All I wanted in that moment was for her to say ""I'm sorry your pie didn't turn out, it'll be okay."" Or just something a human being with emotions would say to their upset daughter.  This even just kind of exemplified what I get sick of in people. Even if you don't ""get it"" why is it so hard to realize that people have different priorities from you? Especially people who are depressed or have other mental illnesses. It can be a triumph for us to get out of bed some days. If we share an achievement or (more rarely) a failure with you, be with us in that emotion for a moment. Why is that so hard for ""normal"" people?  Oh yeah.

"My friend refuses to pay his 600 dollar lost wager to me. What to do? [Long text] One day, a friend and I started arguing about something. It turned into a heated but friendly discussion, and eventually we were both fed up with each other's differing views, so we both proposed a wager. We then spent the rest of the day simply arguing, but without any real conclusion, we decided to actually follow through with our wager. Before making the wager, we agreed on 600 dollars, and it was 100% agreed on from both sides.  Fast forward to him losing the wager and promising to pay me within a month or so when he would get his next salary. I also felt a bit bad about winning, so I decided to call him and ask him what he would have done in the exact same situation if the roles were reversed. He said he would have taken the money. Right then and there, I decided I would also then take the money, as my friend is (or so I thought) a man of honor. During no time did I ever say I didn't want the money from him.  Some time after I won, I made a little joke on facebook along the lines of: ""When am I getting my juicy money?"" with a little meme, as it would be awkward to simply tell him to pay me. He simply said:   ""I invested the money into [[fucking]] ethereum [[of all things he could have done]], and it rose 16%!   I probably won't pay you the money.""  I thought this was a joke, but later found out he was 100% serious. Of course this made me mad - not only that he wouldn't pay me all of a sudden, but also that he broke the news in such an arrogant way. I then argued with him, saying he owed me the money and we agreed on it as two men who made a very serious wager, both knowing what we would get ourselves into. I know for a fact that I would have paid him the second I would have lost, and I have told him so many times. He now claims that it is too much to pay, that it doesn't feel right (yet he also feels guilt) and that I am being negative and should just move on.  I get very mad at unjustice just like this, as could very well have lost the wager. I basically took a very unnecessary risk with this wager. I've told him I can't trust him anymore, but he seems to just want to move on, typing messages on Facebook like nothing has changed. He said he was sorry, but I don't accept the apology as he can still do what is right: pay me the money.  He tried twisting this on me trying to make me look greedy, when in fact he is the one who fucking scammed his friend. What is your view on this?

" I'm sitting here at 2:30 A.M. wondering . . . is it possible to fall in love with a place?  Is it possible to want to be somewhere so much that you would forsake everything . . . just to have a moment in that place?  I think that is what Chicago is to me, as corny as that may be.  I'm interviewing for jobs at the moment, and I can't sleep.  Part of me really wants the job, but another part wants to fly on a whim.  I know what I   should   do, but there is a great difference between what you should do and what you want to do.  I am so nervous right now--about the job, about the possibility of moving, about everything.  I'm literally at a time in my life when I am in serious upheaval.  It's a transition period, and I don't like it.  I wish I had a crystal ball that would tell me where I will be in five years, ten, twenty even.  Maybe then I would know the path that I am supposed to take.  But no one can tell you that, can they?  You can only do what you feel you should and hope that it is the right decision.

"'I promised I'd post regarding what I perceived to be a meltdown. As previously posted, I told all y'all that I'd been taking Neurontin. Since it wasn't prescribed for seizures but for sleep, insurance would no longer cover it because they said it didn't fit into the category of antidepressants or psychotropics, and so on and so forth. All red tape.  So, the Neurontin was stopped, through no fault of my own. Well, this disturbed my therapist. So, after almost 6 weeks off of the Neurontin, during which each week I seemed to be going more off the deep end. Meaning, I couldn't sleep, eat, had the shakes, horrific mood swings, unable to think positive about myself, and piggyback panic attacks and I subsequently was going off on some crying gig, etc.  So, on the 22nd when I saw my doctor she said with everything I was describing, that indeed I was having withdrawals. Like Duh, I already knew that. It seems the combination of the meds I was on was balancing me out and the mere change in the medicine did in fact change the way the other meds worked, or didn't work. Since I'm so hypersensitive to just about every medication, (it took forever to find the right medications and dosages to keep me on the straight and narrow) the doctor said she'd like for me to go back to the psychiatrist that originally prescribed the medications and see if they'd try another antidepressant. Another one? That didn't set well with me and I guess I was at the end of my rope. I broke down and ended up staying at the doctor's office for almost two hours while they had to give me a pill to calm me down. I felt so vulnerable and of course in my state of mind I perceived this as another crisis. I also felt extremely 'stupid' for breaking down that way. That is why I said I had a ""meltdown.""  There wasn't much I could physically do on Thursday, but, I knew I had to come back to earth. After calming down, thanks to their ""cocktail pill"", which I didn't ask its name. I agreed to see the psychiatrist. What choice did I have. I think the crying episode happened because I remembered all the bad events that happened while they were trying to find the right meds that would balance me out. It's scary. Of course while I was at the doctor's, I kept asking stupid questions like, ""why do I have to be on anything?""  Is that denial or what?  So, to cut this short. I'll be going to the psychiatrist as soon as they can fit me in.  But I need some help. I'm asking any of my friends here to give me any input you want. I've been doing pretty good the last couple of days doing the cognitive thinking and just staying busy. It's the down time that's unsettling. And obviously, if you see the time this is being posted, you know I'm not sleeping much. I am thinking positive. My doctor called me Friday to check on me. That was surprising. A doctor really calling back. So, seeing how she's my 'new' doctor, maybe we'll be compatible after all.  Thanks for taking the time to read this and for anything you'd like to add to help.  I really appreciate all of you and the joy I receive from reading and writing to you all means a lot to me. Your kindness means so much.

I tell myself I’m going to be productive and make strides to complete goals. But then I can’t bring myself to do anything.

" What would you do if an ex came by the house, you are with a new person and that person is SO upset that they might leave you?  So upset at the fact that he doesn't want to talk to you, kiss you, or touch you.  You tell him not to worry about the ex, you wouldn't do anything to destroy your relationship with them. They are your first true love, never find anyone better than them. But still, they are so mad, rub it in your face that you were even with that person. Will make love to you but right in the middle all the heat disappears and cant finish. You say its ok, everything will be ok, but its not. I can understand what he is going through, although not sure I would take it so far. I tell him this, still no help. I tell him that he is my world, my best friend, my everything. I could never want a man as much as I want him...But still no help. The relationship already has a ton of troubles..Kids, work, money, his ways, my ways..Average things. But when you add the fact that he doesn't trust you, to the point that he makes himself sick, what do you do?  Get to the point that they are treating you badly as to block the pain if you do hurt them...Does that really help? Or does it make it worse? You don't like to be treated badly, you where in a relationship that was like that for 6 years, you thought that this person would be different, treat you like a queen. But when they get like this, what do you do? Deal with it until it makes you a bitch? Resentful, hurt, angry.......       They realize that they did you wrong, but the damage is done, the hurt will never go away. How many times can you hear ""Im Sorry"" before you realize that its a easy way out. That ""Im sorry"" doesn't cut it anymore. If they were sorry they would stop doing it repeatedly and change their ways.

"In law family vacation + newborn My husband and I have been married since August 2016. I am now pregnant due in April. We have been going on vacation with his parents for the last 3 yrs with his 2 sisters and last year their husband's too. They assume that we will be going on vacation this year too, the baby would be 4 months old I DONT WANT TO GO. FYI, his dad is great and hands off and his mom is very opinionated and gives too much advice but she means well and has been nothing but good to me.   Reasons I don't want to go  1. We have lived with them for the past 5 months, I need a vacation from THEM. I am used to my own space and being able to retreat, I no longer really have that.  2. It will be a 4 hr car ride with a four month old. It may not be that big a deal but other than the car ride, I just rather be home and comfortable and not in another state staring at a beach for 7 days that I don't even want to be at.  3. My husband's older sister has gone out of her way to make me feel excluded in the past and said borderline mean comments. We made some headway last year but I barely tolerate her and avoid her and really don't want to be stressed out for 7 days because of it plus taking care of My baby.

"What's wrong with my dad and what should I do about him? (sorry for the long post) I wasn't sure where to post this, so I just put it under r/family. A bit of background info: My parents have been divorced since I was 4. For as long as I can remember, my dad's been threatening the things I like to keep me in line. When I was 5 or 6, I had a pet bird that he often threatened to kill or release into the wild if I didn't play the piano. These days, he threatens to sell my phone and my computer (which he knows I need for homework) when I don't attend swim practice at a club I've been going to for years. He's also tried to use me to threaten my mom by refusing to pay for my braces (which cost about $5000) because her arthritis has been preventing her from taking me to swim practice. Not to mention she's unemployed. He's also said some pretty hurtful things about both of us when he's gotten mad. He called me egotistic and has told me a couple of times that he no longer looks forward to picking me up from my mom's house, and he's called my mom negative and accused her of not putting in the effort to give me a good childhood. He often tries to guilt-trip me when I piss him off, usually by telling me about how much effort he puts into raising me and how he does everything while I waste my time on my computer. There was a point back in 6th and 7th grade when he was pretty much a textbook case of emotional abuse, but he's improved since then and it gave me hope that he'd stop the threats and angry rants. Also, he rarely goes through with his threats, although that doesn't make them any less hurtful. Besides the threats and somewhat frequent outbursts, he's a generally normal parent. I can get my mom to file for a full transfer of custody, but I'm afraid she can't handle the financial burden of having me full-time. I'm also a little suspicious of her because I remember her hitting me before my parents divorced, even though she denies it. However, she's a much better parent than my dad right now.

Should I take action?",0,wrong dad him sorry long post not sure post this just rfamily bit background info parent divorced long remember dad threatening thing like line pet bird threatened kill release wild did not play piano day threatens sell phone computer which know need homework not attend swim practice club going year tried use threaten mom refusing pay brace which cost arthritis preventing taking swim practice not mention unemployed said pretty hurtful thing gotten mad called egotistic told couple time longer look forward picking mom house called mom negative accused not putting effort good childhood try guilttrip piss off usually telling effort put raising doe waste time computer point th th grade pretty textbook case emotional abuse improved gave hope stop threat angry rant also rarely go threat doe not make hurtful threat somewhat frequent outburst generally normal parent mom file transfer custody afraid handle financial burden having fulltime little suspicious remember hitting parent divorced denies it however better parent dad right now question are consider dad abusive action

I can show emotions, but feel nothing inside.  I can smile if someone makes joke, but it's made up smile.  I don't think friends know more than i told them, but i know there is something they hide from me.  I go to school, but it ""feels"" like everything just passes around me, like i don't exist.  I don't want anything, just go to sleep and never wake up, but it won't happen to me...  I can't control anything.  When i eat, food doesnt have any difference, it just fills void called hunger.  I can't remember anything happened to me last 4 days. Is it bad memory or nothing really happened to me?  Days ago i had thoughts, good thoughts, bad thoughts, suicidal thoughts, but they are gone now. Same with feelings. All i have now is emptiness.

"What’s the worst thing a friend has ever said to you?  I have two stories.   1. This was a few years ago. It was near Christmas time. I had gotten my friend a $300 iPod. I was planning on giving it to her the week before Christmas. So a week prior to me giving her the present, I take her to the movies. I worked at the movie theater so the ticket was free. But I got her a few pins we sell, we got a photo at the photo booth, and we got concessions. The total was probably around $50. When I got to paying for the popcorn and candy, my coworker said it was nice of me to pay for all of it. I jokingly said “this is her Christmas present.” My friend said that it was the cheapest present. Should have taken the iPod back after that, just to be petty. But she had been in a serious car accident that year so I reconsidered that.   2. This one was recent. We live in different countries. She texted me, after not speaking for three days due to busy schedules, about how I’m lucky to not have a health issue. I thought she was just upset with her life. But she was evidently mad at me. She made it seem like I don’t deserve my Masters degree because I didn’t work as hard for mine since I didn’t have to overcome any health issues. The worst thing she said was that I keep bragging about my life, but “nobody cares about you.” She tried apologizing maybe five minutes later but I ignored it. She somehow assumed I wouldn’t be angry. After many texts, I told her that I was upset and that I needed space. She got upset that I was upset about what she said. Just because you are sick and your life feels like shit, that doesn’t give you the right to say something like that to someone and still expect to be friends. Two weeks later she told me how my happy posts were annoying her and she hated it. Blocked her without replying.   Sometimes we need to let things go. The people who are your friends will never say stuff like this.

"Hi all, I am in hell of major depression. After being for over 8 years on Elavil and Valium(small dosage), with good results for most of the time, I tapered down because of the side effects and have been drug free for 1 year. During this year the depression slowly settled in making my life unbearable lately. I don't know what to do. I saw 2 psychiatrists within last month. One of them wanted me on Paxil and the second one on Effexor. Problem is I am so afraid of side effects that I can't begin taking any of them, meantime my life is falling to pieces. My nervous system was completely messed up by these medicines. I had severe fasciculation of muscles for over 4 months after being medicine free (sign of tardive dyskinesia, untreatable neurological condition) and get them back whenever I try any supplement that would increase serotonin level (SAMe, St. John's Wort, Rhodiola). My memory got better after I stopped the medication but now it's falling apart because of the depression I get de-realized I mean if depression won't kill me these medicines will. What are my alternatives (if any)? Shall I take these medicines, for the time being, endure side effects and expose myself to degenerative damage? Shall I stay away from medicines and get incapacitated by depression? Is there any alternative treatment for major depression? I would appreciate any advice.

"How To Befriend Someone I Had An Awkward Past With? I had this female friend that I met almost two years ago. Both of us were really nice with each other and we were pretty good friends at first, but my introverted mind did not help with that. After a while I started to have feelings for her and I started bringing up topics that did not concern her and was too awkward. I used to always text her almost every single day of every single hour to the point that she told my friend that I was annoying her (I knew that a couple of months later). I knew that something was up and that I made her upset but I never really knew what it was. I tried many different approaches to become her friend again but it all lead back to her thinking that I want to date her (she is not the type of person who would want to date at this age). After a year or so is when I figured out that I made her uncomfortable and gave her the notion that I wanted to talk to her only to date her and nothing else. I had an idea to confront her and apologize to her and tell her the truth of what I wanted from her but I keep having panic attacks and anxiety every time I think about doing it. What do you guys think I should do? Some might say that I should leave it behind, but I did such a horrible thing to such a great person and in all my life I have never met someone so true, genuine and wholesome in my life so I cannot give her up and make her feel this way about me. Would appreciate hearing from you people by assisting me.

"I feel like I’m spiraling downwards. I’m losing people and can’t do anything about it or do the wrong things. I’m just searching desperately for someone to care before it’s too late. This summer has just flown by. I work so much and made the mistake of taking multiple summer classes. I spend every moment I can trying to do fun things with my friends but many times it’s not as much as I’d like.  My best friend is stationed overseas, and while I have a close group of friends I’ve known for years, literally all of them are doing something this fall that takes them elsewhere. When they are gone, I’m going to be all by myself.   I’ve been so lonely lately too. Just wanting someone to care about me. I had it and fucked it all up at the beginning of the year, and I just regret it all the time. I drink by myself a lot at night to deal with the loneliness, but it makes it worse.  This summer has already just been shitty, but at least my friends are around. It’s like fall is just a ticking time bomb at this point. No matter how hard I try to talk to someone new it never goes my way and I’m always left on read or stood up on plans.  The other night, I got drunk and did something I’ve never done before, and that was cut myself. Honestly, I feel like I did it to see if I could, and how it would make me feel. I guess I still don’t know how it does, but I was disappointed in myself I let it get so far.  I don’t know.

"I feel like culture is a big reason why a lot of people don’t seek out professional help I don’t know much about other cultures, but I live in a Hispanic/American household. I feel immigrants’ families are typically a very work focused group. They expect you to just tough it out and push through everything . Most people in these communities don’t see depression as an illness, but rather as an excuse for being lazy or unmotivated. There’s almost a macho type mindset that you aren’t supposed to talk about those bad feelings and that shit really sucks. It’s pretty much frowned upon to even consider looking for therapy because it’s “for crazies”.  I’ve been chronically depressed for years but I’m finally going to seek professional help Monday. I’ve been having suicidal tendencies for years and if I ever have kids, which I very much hope I do one day, I’ll be damned if they feel they can’t come to me to talk about any bad thoughts.

"Here's my answer to your age question. Sadly, I am 29 years old: sniffle1: Don't get me wrong. I don't want to be completely alone for the rest of my life. There's a sentimental part of me that yearns for companionship with a guy, but I have such a tall hurdle to overcome before I can even get to that yet. Yeah, but I can relate to the peace and quiet thing by myself. It really is such a luxury nowadays (personally speaking). One thing I reflected on was that I live in a family of 8 people, and maybe that's why I feel so claustrophobic and irritable around lots of people. Essentially, there's no secure privacy, really. Yup, like you I used to live independently when I went to school. I'm on a bit of a break right now, but will go back in September where I'll share an apartment with a roommate I don't know. Right now, I'm mooching off my parents' food and shelter. At age 29, I feel like a little child. And by the way, I'm unemployed too. I tried all summer to land a job, but in vain. I only worked one day for Elections Canada, and that was it. Oh well, a paycheck is a paycheck, right? The thing is, I can't stand living with somebody I hardly know either. Sometimes I just don't want to greet somebody at breakfast, or say a polite 'hello, how are you, or how was your day?"". When I battle depression and social anxiety, I really really need the comfort of familiar people around me at times. The last thing I need is a complete stranger sharing my quarters. But, it's something I can't help. I'll probably isolate myself in my room for a while. At least I get cable TV and the internet.

I've tried so many things to get myself out of this rut but I just can't. I really don't know what to do anymore I feel like i have lost all hope. I've been to a doctor before and got medication but I didn't want that to be the first solution. I guess I expected my doc to have the answer for me to get better.

" Today is the last day of my 4th of July vacation. Then it's back to school for one day, then I'm off again Thursday, then school Friday, off for the weekend, school for three days then off again for six days. I don't know why they schedule two big breaks so close to eachother, but that's YTI for you. I had a pretty decent 4th. Each year both sides of my family have a picnic. They're usually on separate days, but this year they were both on the same day. First we went to my second cousin Jim's house for what is traditionally known as the ""Shinndig"" (I am descended from the Shinn family). This is attended mostly by people who I either don't know or only see once a year at this event. Afterwards, Beth and I went canoeing at Camp Blue Diamond. I hadn't been to Blue Diamond in years, but my parents used to send me there for church camp when I was a kid so it conjured up a lot of memories of not wanting to be there. It's a lot more enjoyable when I can do my own thing instead of being forced to do this or that and sing a bunch of stupid songs. We paddled around the lake for a while, enjoying the serenity of nature....or something. Then it was off to my aunt Wanda's house for picnic #2 where we ate food and watched my uncle and cousin and a couple of kids from accross the road set off fireworks in the rain. Then we headed to my grandmother's house for a little while before going back to my parents'. Overall, it was a good day. Good times were had by all and Beth got to see some wildlife she's never seen before, like dragonflies and a vulture (or was it a buzzard? I don't know the difference). I don't know how you can live for 26 years and never see a dragonfly, but that's Beth. Well, that's it for now. Maybe I'll update this thing again sometime.

"My Friend is Draining Me Apologies, this is a very long post!  I’ve been good friends with a girl for around 10 years since we were teenagers. She moved overseas around 5 years ago. She used to be such a fun, bubbly and funny person until she met her boyfriend around 3 years ago. Looking back, I can see that she was a always bit crazy and insecure (her father is emotionally abusive and tells her she’s worthless and stupid), but meeting him seems to have exacerbated all her bad qualities. She has a really low self esteem and perception issues when it comes to relationships. She also has OCD.  She was, and still is OBSESSED with her now ex boyfriend. They had an on off relationship where she thought it was normal to call him “just ten times” in one day, and would get upset and not be able  “sleep or eat” if he doesn’t reply, thinks talking on the phone three times a day is not much, they pushed and shoved each other, she hit him, he talked to other girls and acted like she wasn’t his girlfriend, she’d call his voicemail just to hear his voice, he threatened to hurt her, she considered going to a shitty college just to be near him, etc.. basically an abusive and obsessive relationship with awful communication.  Every time she messages me, she’ll ask how I am and ask a few questions, and then steer the conversation back to her numerous problems and her ex. About how she’s so poor (goes out every second night and goes on shopping sprees), how she’s really sad (but won’t see a counselor because she’s “too poor”), how she wants to be confident and independent (goes back to the ex repeatedly and doesn’t listen to any of the advice I give her), tells me she can’t eat or sleep because she’s heartbroken (I told her I was eventually okay after I broke up with an ex, but she brushed it off as I hadn’t gone out with him for as long and how she gave everything to her ex). She also says how I’m so lucky to live with my boyfriend and how I have such an amazing life, as if she’s the only person in the world that has problems.  I’ve talked to her multiple times about how talking about her ex all the time and her problems is effecting me (as well as her other friends), and how she should really see a professional as this behavior is really hurting her. She always apologizes and says that she didn’t realize how it might make me annoyed, and she’ll send me an inspirational video or inspirational words, and asking about me before going back to changing the topic so she can talk about herself, her ex and how it’s so hard for her right now, how she feels suffocated and her heart is broken. I understand that people go through hard times in their lives, but this has lasted at least 3 years. I’ve always said how I’ll be there for her and that if she needs to talk to someone, I’ll listen, but I’m starting to feel that this is a one way relationship.  The frustrating thing is that she says she agrees to everything I say, and how’s shes going to change, but nothing has changed! She says she’s more confident and doing this and that to help herself, but she just plasters selfies and videos of herself going out with people to try and convince people that she’s having an amazing time.   I don’t want to just ignore her, but I don’t think talking to her again will do anything. I’ve been nice, brutally honest, and even angry at her and nothing has changed. She’s stuck in her own tragic world and I’m realizing that maybe she thrives in this drama, and that she’s lonely and needs a boyfriend’s attention to validate her self worth . Our other mutual friend has cut ties with her due to this. I think I have put up with this for so long as we’re not living in the same country..   Sorry about the long rant and formatting, I’m on my cellphone.  TL;DR friend who lives overseas is emotionally draining me every time I talk to her.

" Everybody's been arguing today, and it's driving me out of what little bit of my mind that I have left. First of all, my mom wouldn't take me and my boyfriend(T.J.) to the mall. That was only the beginning, though..I'm usually the arguing one of the family, but she's acting like a fleeting psycho today! i don't know or really even care why she's so mad, but she doesn't have to fly off the handle at everyone who crosses her path! It's really bad when she only has 1 or 2 days off a week, and I don't even want to be around her. things just seem so much peaceful when she isn't even here. I don't think that's a good thing, but I know that me and her DON'T get along, and i'm not as upset when she's at work. It really sucks that i wish she actually was at work. It's okay though, I get to go shopping and go to work myself tomorrow, then on Wednesday I get to go to church AND see T.J. I really like him..he's like the ""guy version"" of me..He listens to the same msuic, and likes alot of the same movies, sports, and stuff that I do. I just can't get over all that we have in common. I just hope he isn't mad that my mom hasn't let me call him back..i have to wait until 9 to do that. i don't see why we have to use stupid cell phones. I wish we just had a normal phone, and I wish we were a normal family..If I told my parents that, they'd be like ""well most of the time YOU are the problem""...Real good way to make your kid feel wanted, huh? Anyways, school starts back in a couple of weeks, so between school during the day, working at night, church on wednesdays and sundays, i probably won't be here that much anyway. *Yay* Plus since I'm a senior, I'll probably have alot of senior activities and stuff. Wow. I can't believe I'm going to graduate in june. This is exciting, but I don't know what I'm going to do afterwards..I guess i just need to worry about making it TO my graduation. I wish there was some way to make my parents understand me a little bit better, but I guess there isn't.

"Anyone elses depression feel like this? Good day, This might be weird but stick with me.  I suffered/suffer from depression. Basically from middle school to about a year ago when I finally started on medication.  The best way I could describe my depression is voices in my head saying mean and awful things to me, about me, about what other people are thinking or saying about me, turning positives into negatives etc.   I started playing a game called Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice tonight and the their is a theme around psychosis, and the main character has many voices in her head. Here is the opening, (possible trigger warning?), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rob7C1lCYEI  As soon as I heard all the voices calling Senua names, putting her down, laughing at her etc. I was like holy shit that was me. I am not trying to say I have/had psychosis, I just thought that the voices thing felt like what I went through.

" There are things running through my head today.  What should I do about my future.  I have a decent job, an apartment, a relationship, but  what do I want to do with my life?   There are many things I've wanted to do.  When I was in high school I wanted to be a broadcaster.  When I was in college, while things became less clear, I knew that I wanted to study English and Tudor history and combine them somehow or another.  Now that I'm out of school, all I want is to go back - to do something different; to be something more than what I am.    So, here are some things I've thought about doing.  I haven't really thought them through all the way, but that's what this sort of forum is for, right?    I've always wanted to write books.  Either researching stuff from the Elizabethan or early Tudor time period, or historical based romances or even just plain old fiction.  The problem is - what would I write about?  There are already tons of books about Elizabeth I, her sister Mary, her cousin Mary Stuart...it's a bit frustrating.  But, I suppose there's always room for a well researched, well written book out there.    I've thought about studying to become a teacher.  But, what would I teach?  English or History?  On what level would I teach?  I'm not the most patient person in the world...I'd hate teaching in an elementary school or even a middle school.  So, I guess that leaves high school and college levels.  I'd enjoy having the summers off, but probably not much else.  I'd love to be able to travel for 3 months out of every year.  Or even travel for 1 month and work the other 2 doing something else.  It's a possibility I guess I should look into.    The law has also fascinated me from a young age.  I'd love to be a lawyer.

"Help with/what to do about toxic sister? (Sorry for sloppy wall and if this isn't the right thread) As the title says I don't know what to do about my 29 year old sister. She is known by the family to be immature, selfish, and impulsive. She repeatedly burns bridges with family when she does not get her way and will give them the short end of a deal if it benefits her (ie. Not paying my financially struggling mother back on the multiple occasions of covering her rent or car payment because she decided to use her paycheck on a new TV or $200 purse). I'd love to not speak to her and never go to her place but because she is the mother of my 2 year old niece this is not possible. To give you some perspective, she has fights with my niece's father who got their old apartment raided by the police for selling heroin (finding heroin and a pistol in a safe in the apartment) to the point of yelling and hitting, even late at night when the child should be asleep, right in front of my niece. Because her father is soon going on trial and to prison for a long time (ex convict in possession of a firearm on top of selling heroin) and as previously stated, my sister being a half-assed parent, I am left to clean up after her when it comes to my niece. I have to be consistent in teaching her not to hit people and not to spit at them. Again, to give you some perspective, I am 15 years old and do not need the stress of making sure a child grows up to be a decent person on my plate. My sister has multiple DUI and assault charges which have resulted in her drivers license being revoked yet she continues to drive with my niece in the car even when everyone who knows her and cares about the child tells her not to. Although she is better now she is still a complete ass of a parent with her first kid dying before the age of one and losing custody of her two other sons about 9 years ago (older one being 13 and the other being 9). I am actually convinced her uterus is hexed because every time she has a kid shit goes horribly south which makes me terrified in the case of my niece. In the winter of 2016 my sister attempted suicide (my niece being just under 1) and while her drug dealer boyfriend screamed at her while she laid on the floor saying she wanted to die I had to make sure the child was still sleeping through all of it in the next room. Now although few and far apart, I've had my struggles with depression so I understand how difficult postpartum depression can be but even then I believe as a parent you always put the child first in every scenario. On top of everything else she completely spoils my niece buying her an unnecessary amount of toys and candy whenever she reaches for it at the store and I know she is not going to be able to handle it when my niece wants something at the mall my sister absolutely cannot afford at the moment and her entire worldview changes when she realizes she does not get everything she wants when she wants it. Although I mostly enjoy being alone and I have never been in a relationship I can only imagine possible significant others would not be totally understanding when I try to explain that my niece comes first which only adds to the stress and worry. To be clear, my sister is not neglectful and provides for my niece with everything a child needs such as diapers, food, bed, cleaning, etc. but if she continues this way (which I know she will) my niece will grow up with the same characteristics as my sister and it's just about all up to me to make sure that doesn't happen.

"Hi I am trying to get a grip back on my life. My mental health has cost me my marriage. My husband just couldn't handle it anymore. I was hospitalized five times in April and May for suicidal attempt and thoughts. He was there every day for me but felt abandoned by me. As he said through tears ""he couldn't save me"". After the hospitalizations I was really needy. He married a strong and independent woman. In Sept I took myself off my medicines and went into a rage and accused him of cheating on me. That broke his heart and his spirit...he left. Of course, I went into a tailspin. Finally got of the couch last weekend, three months later. I stopped my counseling and medicines. I know I have to get it back together again. I guess looking for support here is a step in the right direction. I am trying to figure out how to go on when you lost the best thing that ever happened to you.

"Dropping by to mention you should take some Vitamin D supplements. Of course, check with your doctor. Etc. etc.   Vitamin D is the sunshine pill that most people are deficient in. This is also much more of an issue in colder areas or for those who cover up from the sun often. The best way to get vitamin D is through certain food combinations and routines in sitting in delicate morning sunlight and in most cases, taking a supplement is necessary to keep this vitamin flowing in your body.   Vitamin D is best absorbed with calcium, so if you’re taking a supplement, finding foods, or sitting in the sun consider to add the calcium as well.   You will find that your mood will be better or more stable with vitamin D consumption.  Make sure to strive for a more regulated sleeping schedule as well and something to keep your mind stimulated without an electronic screen.    I may have butchered a lot of this vitamin D thing so please take the time to read this:  https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/reading-between-the-headlines/201307/vitamin-d-deficiency-and-depression   If you need anything, message me.

"My mom went to go to a family gathering (I didn't go) and one of my aunt's seems to have forgotten my name. Is it reasonable to be bothered by this? I don't see my dad's side of the family that much after I moved because its a long commute. However we still send out Christmas  cards and two of them call from time to time.   One of my Aunts was having a retirement party and my mom went to it out of obligation more than out of wanting to. The Aunt who the party was for was welcoming and nice to her but the rest were just talking amongst themselves about politics and other crap.  One of my other Aunts who lives outside of the area (compared to us and the others) went up to my mom and said hi to her but when she asked about me she said ""How's your daughter?"".  Everyone else who asked about me asked about me by name,so my mom took notice of this and found it odd.  She told me about it when she got home and it bothered me. I was the flowergirl in the wedding for this particular Aunt, so I don't see how she could not even remember my name anymore.  Is it reasonable to be bothered by this?

"My friend is dating my friend's rapist. my friend, let's call her 'b' is very troubled. i've known her for years and she's always had very severe depressive, suicidal and destructive tendencies. recently, it had gotten to the point where our friendship was struggling because it always felt like i had to be looking for her constantly and making sure she wasn't literally running away to commit suicide (and if i wasn't there for her all the time i felt like a bad friend). anyway, she started talking to this boy (let's name him 's') who I knew fairly well for many bad reasons. He was dating b and I's friend (named 'e') for a long period, and tldr, he was extremely abusive and raped her multiple times during their relationship. B was friends with E. Recently, B decided to begin dating S (after lying about meeting him repeatedly over a couple days period). I cut off the friendship but she kept trying to speak to me as I didn;t think she got my point of not wanting to be her friend but I think I've made it more clear in recent messages. It turns out B may have lied about a lot of things (to the point of manipulating me about my trauma, telling me certain people said things about me and didn't like me. she says they definitely said it but the people say otherwise so I don't know who to believe. she has extreme 'stories' that i don't know if are true anymore either). B thinks that me cutting off the friendship is to an extent not fair as it's not my business to make her choose between her now boyfriend and me. I disagree - she is dating our friend's rapist (well not her friend anymore) and I find it disgusting and I can't be friends with her due to this.   Mostly, I am paranoid that I am.. well.. wrong. Overreacting, as it's not 100% to do with me - I was friends with him during him and E's relationship but not after I knew of the way he treated her.

"Advice Please I've been in a relationship with a woman for some time now, and it's becoming serious enough that marriage is a certainty. She has a son from her previous marriage, seven years old. Her previous husband, however, was very controlling and abusive. Her son has a lot of behaviour issues as a result. He constantly swears (""fuck, shit, cunt, etc"", just to show how extreme), he's violent a lot, throwing things across the room, he's constantly screaming and shouting, no concept of manners. He'll shout ""give me food now"". His mother, as a result of the cruel treatment she got from her husband, is too scared to stand up to him. He clearly has anger issues bordering on clinical. He'll often have breakdowns with fits of anger.  She lives with her parents. While they have the best of intentions for their grandson, her mothers treatment of her is vile. She's cruel and demeaning. She constantly undermines her confidence and authority, saying she's stupid and doesn't know what she's doing in front of her son, and then, stupidly, complains that she get her son to listen to her. She regularly swears. She loudly gossips about everybody, complaining about with violent undertones. And to make it worse, she often threatens calling social services on her. Personally, I doubt she would, as she got far more incriminating evidence against her than her daughter. But either way, he would be taken from both of them.  So, yeah..... a bit complicated. No idea what to do. As it's very likely that I'll become a step father to this child, I was wondering what advice people could give, or direct me to somewhere that could help.

"I just don't know how to deal with this shit anymore. I can remember being depressed and having anxiety as early as 15 years old (31 now). I'm sure I have been happy some time along the way but I can't remember. I think most of the ""good"" times were just when I had enough energy to pretend and delude myself and convince everybody around me that I was normal and healthy. Unfortunately, as time has gone on my times of stability have gotten shorter, and my major depressive episodes have only gotten much worse, and lasted longer.  I've dropped out of 4 different colleges and have quit every job I have ever had, most of them with literally no notice. I have seen doctors, I've been on different medications with no noticeable effects. I am see a doctor now, but am hoping to get in to see a psychiatrist or mental health specialist soon, but that could be a month or two away at this point.  I am just completely exhausted at this point and don't know how much longer I can take it. My parent just keep telling me I need to get a job, like that would make everything better. It definitely doesn't help that they try to get me to go to church with the every other week or ask me all the time if I have met any girls that I'm interested in. They can't understand that just taking a shower on any given day or leaving the apartment to buy groceries is a monumental task.  They ask if I am suicidal, as if that is the only way to tell how severe my depression is. I don't consider myself suicidal, but I no longer have a desire to continue living. Every day I wake up is another disappointment, another day of being incapable of doing anything and feeling sorry for myself. I'm pretty sure the main reason that I'm not suicidal is that I am convinced that I would fail or just wouldn't be able to go through with it and the embarrassment would be too much to handle.  As much as my family frustrates me, I understand that they are trying to help but they just don't know how. They have supported me financially on several occasions before now. Without their help I would almost certainly be homeless or dead by now.  All I want is to not feel this way anymore. Every time I leave my apartment I am tense and in fear of the people around me. I escape for social situations as soon as possible only to get home and feel completely worthless. I can accept that I will always live with this illness, that it is never going away.

"I'm having trouble getting along with someone I want to consider a friend Long story short: This guy was originally a friend of a friend, I'll call him Jeff. We all go to the same college and have the same mutual friends. Jeff and I got along pretty well for a bit but recently all he does is piss me off  While I get the whole ""friends mess with each other"" idea, but it just doesn't fly with me and this guy. I may mess around with my friends once in a while and I'm a big joker, but for the most part I just like to have a good time together whenever we do anything whether we play video games, go to the gym, etc.  On the other hand, it feels that Jeff goes out of the way to piss me off no matter what we do because he KNOWS it will piss me off. I know typically you want to show no reaction to this kind of thing to avoid fanning the flames but I can't help it  I don't know how to deal with him or get the message across. When I tried to sit down with him and talk man to man, Jeff didn't seem to take me seriously and kept going ahead with his previous antics. I talked with our other friends (who have known him longer than I) and they all just told me something along the lines of: ""he doesn't mean anything by it, it's just how he is don't get offended"". But unfortunately, we don't mix that way.  Now Jeff's not inherently a bad person, when he's serious he's actually a pretty good guy. He has helped me out in some tough binds before and has done so for the other guys too, all of which I greatly appreciate.

" It's Monday once again, after a short break over the weekend,its funny how time flies nowadays and how you can never get things done, no matter how much effort or planning you've put into them. August is one month that I feel-the days and nights went by in a flash...  Was in the car, on the way to work earlier and there was this one Kancil, which was following me so close from behind. The unbelieavable thing is that, I was doing 140 and so how much was the chap doing? By the look on his face and the passenger sitting right next to him, I could tell that he's a student, studying in the college somewhere near my office or maybe he's a working guy. But they looked young and were pretty excited-being able to hog me like that. I gave way and they went so fast that, for a few moments there, I was praying that their tyre would go *FLAT*!!! ...because they were not worried at all about their safety. Do they know that it's Kancil they're driving, not a bloody Mercedes and even if it is a Mercedes, it's dangerous still for a 17 year old kiddie to drive in such a way. I am not old but I'm not a teenager anymore, I have been there and done that...BUT...I didn't interfere with anybody's life during that time and I did it, with full consideration in mind that, I would bear all the consequences,alone. On my own, of course parents are parents and they'd always worry about things, that you can't stop them. It's a natural instinct embedded in parents, a speacial gift from god. If not,Moms would be walking around leaving their kids and home and shop at Malls...'Why bother about Baby Cemara? No , she'll be fine, she can drink her milk from the bottle by herself.She can suckle later..' We all don't what that, trust me. So, kids or teenagers like those I came across this morning, they're not really bad..they're just at that age where, they rule everything...Hope one of them will turn out to be a successful someone, if not all....

None of them were punished for it and I had to keep seeing them on visitations until I was sixteen (i'm still sixteen) and I told my dad I didn't want to see him anymore. This obviously did not make him happy and he knows it is about the abuse. Every once and awhile he emails me or calls and tries to make me feel guilty about it and when he does I get upset all over again just when I had started to seem to get better. I really wanted to write a book about my life, but I figured that because my dad and his family wasn't punished or proven guilty that I'd be sued for it. I want to change my last name and then get a pen name, but my mom says I have to wait until I am eighteen. I don't exactly want to wait that long to write my book, but I feel like I don't have a choice. I've considered taking them back to court but I figured it's probably hopeless and I feel guilty and doubtful even though I know it happened. Anyways, I don't want to put my mom through all that again. A lot of times I think that I imagined it all and deny it because I wish it didn't happen. I really want to be a writer and to help people who've been abused, but without proving my abusers guilty I feel as if this is impossible, that it isn't my right. I'm scared they'd be found innocent and then try to kill me for taking them to court. What should I do? I know everyone here is having a hard time and I really don't mean to be a bother. I feel guilty just talking about it because there are so many others who've had the same thing happen to them but I really needed advice.",1,sexually physically emotionally abused father uncle grandparent time fifteen mother taken father family court said say father only five not old know anything punished seeing visitation sixteen i sixteen told dad did not want anymore obviously did not make happy know abuse awhile email call try make feel guilty doe upset just started better really wanted write book life figured dad family not punished proven guilty sued it want change pen name mom say wait eighteen not exactly want wait long write book feel like not choice considered taking court figured probably hopeless feel guilty doubtful know happened anyways not want mom again lot time think imagined deny wish did not happen really want writer help people abused proving abuser guilty feel impossible not right scared innocent try kill taking court do know having hard time really not mean bother feel guilty just talking thing happen really needed advice
" In the past few days my life has changed so much. First i stayed at my friend Pauls house and by the time i left i had a GF. The story goes: I had been begging her to go out with me, she finally agreed to go out with me. I was so happy, and as it turns out i was her first kiss. It was great. She is the greatest thing to happen to me in a while. She is beautiful and i don't think she believes it. But she is. She has surprised me so much since i have known her. When i first met her my thought was ""Man she is beautiful"" I also thought ""I am going to get her if its the last thing i do"". I knew i had to have her. And now we are going out and her mom doesn't know! Not that we think she would get mad though i am sure she would, but we want to give it time. I want to be able to stay there a few times before i am not allowed to. I am sure that it might backfire at us but its a danger i am willing to conquer when it comes. Well its been 4 days since i asked her out, and i think it is going great. I got to spend time with her while i was there, and we had quite a bit of fun. But that is our business. She really did surprise me. She really is a great kisser, she can always get me going. I haven't told her that, but everytime she kisses me, i get a hard on. I guess she will know now!

"My friend is a douchebag I don’t know what to do about my friend. I guess you could say he is the “leader” of our friend group. Because of this, no one does anything when he pulls a dick move. Everyone seems to worship him. He never thinks anything is his fault, even when he can do the most fucked up thing. He has no respect for anyone, he’s extremely rude. I can’t trust the guy cause he’ll share your secrets to the whole group (including you) just to be funny. He’s a major hypocrite. He bullies my other friend. This guy has been pretty much my best friend for a very long time, and I don’t know what to do. He says I’m his best friend, and it seems like that when it’s only me with him, but when there are other people there, he just leaves me in the dust, even though he always complains about when his friends hang out with someone else (like I said he’s a hypocrite). He makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit sometimes. I want to stop being friends with this guy, but he’s friends with all of my other friends.

"Why do I pick the worst friends? This is an absolute rant: I am frustrated and I don't have any friends apparently to work through this with so Reddit it is! What do you know? There I'd convieniantly a sub-reddit for this very issue I am having.  First of all, I want to start off by saying, all of my friends are not terrible. The majority of them, yes.  I feel like friends are supposed to add value and positive energy to your life and that is not happening in mine.   It has been becoming clear over the last few months and I think I need to figure out how to dump these friends that drain me.   Here are some examples. I will use letters instead of their names.  Friend A.  I have known A for about 10 years now. We worked together for many years. We partied together for many years. We have kept in contact for many years. I didn't see A as much when I moved about a half hour away. Life happens. Things happen. People get busy and I totally understand that. I drive, she STILL doesn't. We still remained friends though.  However..... I am the one who checks up on her and messages to simply see how things are or invite her somewhere. She gets a hold of me when she needs a ride or something. I can't remember a time she has ever just called or texted to say hi and ask me how life is. I like A  because she is pretty easy to talk to. We have had a lot of good times and have made a ton of memories. One thing that I always tried to look past is her utter lack of manners. I don't think in my ten years of knowing her I have ever heard her mutter a thank you. All of the things I have done for her, never once was there a thank you. I have given her tons and tons of rides and she has offered gas money and I never received a dime. I never expected a dime but if you are going to offer it at least honor your word. What really prompted this post was something that happened today. A is pregnant and she is due sometime in January. I hadn't heard from any of our mutual friends about planning a shower so I messaged her best friend and asked If she had thought about doing so. Her best friend hadn't even given it any thought. .... she said if I would like to take the reigns and plan it then she would help but had no interest in planning the party. I thought it was a little odd but I felt like A really should have a baby shower. I reached out to a few more people who I thought might have the same idea and they hadn't thought to do it either. I'll be honest, I am not a party planner. .. not even close. The thought of entertaining/interacting/etc with people makes me super anxious.... BUT all that aside... she is my friend and she deserves to be thrown a baby shower. I have been thinking about ideas over the past few weeks but haven't put anything into motion yet. I get a message from her today over Facebook that says:  ""So H informed me you guy were gonna plan a babyshower for me...well we was unaware so C and R are getting together to do one...so if you would like get in touch with one of them and details can be worked out....we just know we are having it October 14th""  I read it. My first initial reaction was annoyance. Since then it has progressed... I think I would have been less annoyed if there was a ""but thank you for thinking of me anyways"" or something along those lines. There is not one ounce of gratitude in this message. I'm kind of annoyed with myself for expecting there to be any at all. One would think I would have learned by now.  So, I guess the point of this rant is for me to figure out what I need to do about all of this. My gut is telling me it's time to ditch the ungrateful, mannerless nonsense. The other part is sad to lose a ""friend"".  Are my expectations too high? Is it wrong of me to expect my friends to have basic manners? Please, any and all advice is welcomed.

"Should I cut my losses &amp; move on? I have a co-worker &amp; friend that I’ve gotten to know really well since we started working together almost 2 years ago. He seemed a bit socially awkward so I befriended him. We started hanging out &amp; we shared some pretty deep things with each other. He’s not big on emotions but he said he just feels comfortable talking to me about things.   However, he’s a self proclaimed “bad” friend. He wants friendships on his rules, his terms &amp; there is no real sense of urgency in getting back to you.  He’ll not text me back for days. When I check on him he tells me I shouldn’t worry (I’m a worrier by nature). He says he doesn’t owe me anything yet tells me I’m one of the only people who has ever shown him unconditional love in a friend sort of way.   One of my biggest pet peeves is when people ignore me. Im sure he knows that &amp; he does it on purpose at times. But, I also know that’s just who he is based on how other co-workers talk about him at work. I can be very overbearing at times myself. I try not to be but I get really insecure about our friendship if he just ignores me; like I did something wrong to warrant being ignored??!?   I just feel like this friendship is so up &amp; down. He has no regard for my feelings or how his actions make me feel. He thinks emotions are dumb. He says they just cause problems &amp; people get hurt. He literally almost never shows emotion in any situation. However, I have seen him cry before &amp; I know he is capable of loving someone. He claims he has no love to give because he has such a poor opinion of himself.   I’ve never had a friendship that has been this difficult to maintain. I always feel like I’m doing something wrong. It’s like walking on eggshells. I’m thinking about just ending the friendship but we still work together. I tend to get VERY passive aggressive when I am hurt. I know I will start to get that way at work toward him while he will be as polite &amp; professional as can be because that’s how he is. He controls his emotions SO well.

" Ever notice how the end of the school year is both exhilarating and a real let down? I spend an entire year teaching students to be better thinkers, writers, and people, yet only some of this shows through. Your high achievers get better, some of your middle achievers improve, and a lot of students just stay the same.  Behavior is at an all time low at this point too. Since my fifth graders don't have finals, thye've been tuning me out for the last three weeks. It's terrible. Although there is little I can do about it, I just hope that something of the knowledge and behavior skills that I taught remain with them. Maybe my modeling good behavior might just rub off on them in the long run. Who knows? Anyway, it has been a long year and I am ready for it to end. Thank God it ends next week!

"Is she toxic or am I reading too much into it...rant warning So to nutshell my relationship with her is that we met at our last job and hang out a lot. It's still a fairly new friendship but I'm noticing some things that are starting to get to me. I'm unemployed now and she has a awesome new job.  So first thing I noticed was she didn't used to be the one to call me   but then when she needs a ride somewhere then she wants to chat and will try to segway the ride request in. If she made a habit out of calling any other time then I wouldn't stress it. It just makes me feel used when ""I just want to check on you"" turns to ""I need a ride"".   Which brings me to the other issue. When she does call me it's the most disrespectful phone etiquette I have ever seen. After she knows she is going to get a ride she stays on the call(must be out of guilt or not wanting to make it seem like it's the only thing she wants.) but while she's on the phone she does not pay attention to me. Like she'll make active listening sounds that don't match up, like uh huh and a giggle when I just told her that I might need to give my cats up. Without telling me or warning or any sort of hint she'll just start talking to someone else around her like I'm not even on the other end. Worst yet almost always these calls are while she is at work and is just bored. On my end I'm distraction free and at the most filling out a job applications or pacing and I dunno I feel like if you are going to call your friend you should acknowledge they are on the other line and not just background noise while you browse the internet.   Which brings me to her job. Her job to me is the most ideal job I could think of and I already know that but she brags about to the point that I'm getting really bitter. She keeps telling me about how many hours she's getting and during one of those phone calls even worked out how much she was expecting to make on her next check(unprompted). And she's so excited about 3 week paid vacation she is getting, and her health benefits and tuition reimbursement so she's going to take some classes on company dime. I mean I expressed how happy I was for her but she brings it up enough that I just wonder if she likes hurting me.   Then there is her and her boyfriend. There is a whole thing about her and her psycho ex who even though made her feel afraid for her life, she still loves and talks to. WHILE WITH HER BOYFRIEND. I don't think she cheats on her boyfriend but I don't understand that whole deal that seems like an issue for another reddit thread all together. But yeh she does brag about how much sex she has with her boyfriend and how much they love each other. Which brings me to this next issue that I couldn't even wrap my head around.  So I brought her home from work the other night and we were hanging out at my apartment. At some point she realizes that she forgot her keys back at work. This was after her work closed for the day. So I don't see the big deal I offer up ""well when your boyfriend picks you up then he can let you in."" But she doesn't seem to be hooking to that and is like ""I'm going to check the bus scheduled and just because I'm curious I'll check uber prices."" I'm really confused at this point.   Essentially, her plan was to just go to her boyfriends work and hang out there till he finishes closing. Keep in mind we are neighbors, he doesn't have to go out of his way more than one street over and he has picked her up from my place before. Now he works about 30mins away so it would be a hell of a trek to drop her off there and make way back while it's dark and rainy and I don't know the area at all. At some point the brother of her boyfriend calls and says they can go hangout while she's locked out and she doesn't even ask me if I want to join or anything just leaves as if she had just been waiting at the busstop that whole time.   She reassures me that she does like hanging out and I think we do have fun when she is hanging out. So I really don't want to cut her out of my life as I tend to do. It's just tonight seemed to be the worst.  So she calls me up and tells me that her boyfriend is off of work so she won't need a ride and she thought that we could all hangout. Since we were going to meet up with some more friends.  Welp, the other friends canceled and it was just us 3. We had some dinner and then her boyfriend suggested we go see a movie. I was already dressed and ready so why the hell not. I'm pretty sure she agreed(it's honestly hard to tell sometimes with her.) We got there and the movie me and her boyfriend were wanting to see was already playing. And she was being indecisive but eventually agreed to go. So me and him are hurrying to get to our seats while she just takes her time shuffling along. We already missed the first 15minutes. We had just had dinner but she wanted to stop at the concession and she just didn't seem interested at all about being there.  So we watch the movie and about midway she leaves, I assume to go to the bathroom but shes gone for about 15minutes and I'm just sitting there thinking ""she wants us or one of us to go check on her"" but I wanted to watch the movie and I didn't feel like putting up with her drama.   Afterwards she passive aggressively sits at her seat through the entire credits. Which didn't have mid credit or end credit footage. So I ask her whats wrong, and she's like I just felt a wave of depression and just wanted to go home and didn't know why I was even here or watching this movie and I felt forced into the whole thing. WHICH CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. If any one was forced it was me, she called me for that night out and I feel she is trying to make herself out to be a victim in it.   I don't want to end this with her, because I like her and her friends which I only know through her so it would mean cutting all of them out. It's just I keep seeing how selfish she can be. I don't know if this friendship can be saved or worth saving.

"My Boyfriend Talks Daily About Suicide -- Won't Go To Hospital Hi guys, I'm really just at a loss for what to do. I am absolutely gutted.  My boyfriend has pretty serious depression and is in dire need of help. I won't be able to get him in to see a therapist until next week. He has recently become quite down on his luck and he hates himself for it. His anxiety stopped him from going to work, and he was fired. He has a new job now, but he hates it as it is a factory job where he works 60 hrs/week.   Any time I try to help him find a new job so he can leave this job, he completely panics and shuts down and I can't say anything or else he yells. It has gotten so bad recently that I dread waking up in the morning because of the psychological warfare with him. He will do things like saying he wants to self-harm, or he is going to jump out of the car while I am driving.  I have been with him for years, through thick and thin. I have had to bring him to the hospital before, and he did get better for a few months. He told me tonight he doesn't want me to pick him up from work, and that he wasn't going to come home. At this point I feel completely lost, and I know calling the police won't help.  I feel trapped and I need to get out for my own health, but I am deathly terrified he is going to kill himself if I leave. He told me I am the only thing holding him back from killing himself. I'm scared. He is such a good person when he isn't feeling this constant depression. I don't know how to get him to understand we just want to help him. He shuts me down every single day, and it hurts knowing he has given up on himself.   What can I do to help him until he can see his therapist next week? I want to leave but I am so scared he will kill himself if I do.",1,boyfriend talk daily suicide wo not hospital hi guy really just loss do absolutely gutted boyfriend pretty depression dire need help not able therapist week recently quite luck hate it anxiety stopped going work fired new job now hate factory job work hrsweek time try help new job leave job completely panic shuts say yell gotten bad recently dread waking morning psychological warfare him thing like saying want selfharm going jump car driving year thin bring hospital before did better month told tonight doe not want pick work not going come home point feel completely lost know calling police not help feel trapped need health deathly terrified going kill leave told thing holding killing himself scared good person not feeling constant depression not know understand just want help him shuts single day hurt knowing given himself help therapist week want leave scared kill do
"I'm so tired. So tired of everything.  I lost mostly everything I've cared about in such a short timeframe. My father went from cancer diagnosis to dead in a 3 month time span.

"Ending a 6 year friendship over her husband   I [24F] am not sure how I feel about my friend’s behavior [28F] and I’m considering ending our friendship because of it. A little backstory, I’ve known her almost 7 years. We met through our boyfriends (they’re our exes now) and we used to do double dates and a lot of couple-y activities like roller skating or sleepovers and things like that. She and I stayed friends despite the break-ups with our boyfriends at the time. But our friendship has been a little rocky because of her busy schedule. She usually works 40-60 hours in any given week and she even lived in another city for 18 months so I didn’t always get to see her or hang out as much as I would have liked. But we’ve kept in touch through social media. I’ve always expressed a desire to hang out more, like doing road trips or daycations or local activities like concerts but she’s either too busy or financially strapped to do it. So typically we either see each other on our birthdays and that’s about it.  The problem I’m having is that she’s married to this guy she met 4 years ago and I’ve been single for  5 years. I have a FWB [25M] who I’ve been in a “situationship” with for 18 months. I kept that a secret from her because it’s not a real relationship and I’m not sure if it’ll ever become one. She’s met him recently through a fluke of bumping into each other while he and I were out at a store. Ever since she became aware of his existence, she’s been pressuring me to plan “double dates” like going to the drive-ins to see the new Star Wars Movie or coming over to their house for Redbox movies and dinner. I already told her that’s not really the type of relationship that I have. I’ve mentioned the idea of all 4 of us hanging out to him casually to see if he’d be interested but he doesn’t want to do it.  When I told her that I rather she and I just go to the movies together or girls’ night over at my place, she said she can’t because she wants to spend time with her husband when she’s not busy working. I feel like she’s not really going to spend time with me unless I give in and do “couples” activities.  I just feel like she and I are in such different places in our lives and have different values when it comes to friendship that it'd be better to end it now than to continue trying to spend time with someone who doesn't seem to want to do things just the two of us. Is it wrong of me not to want to be friends because of this?

"Group of friends exclude one person and I’m now stuck I between... So I have a group of about 13 friends, some of us have been friends most of our lives and others have joined over the past 10 years.   One friend I’ve always be closest to went though a tough time recently and it was decided by some of the louder group members that she shouldn’t be part of the group anymore as she wasn’t making any effort and she was being a drama queen! (She definitely was not and they were all being extremely judgemental without knowing her full story) I totally disagreed with them and confronted them about it. The loud ones argued back and the others stayed quiet and a few then spoke to me privately later and said they agreed with me. There are a few that I will never again consider a friend going forward!  My dilemma is that there are still a good few in the group I enjoy spending time with and would like to remain friends with and I am also friends with the excluded friend! I feel that I either have to leave the friendship group or remain in it and stay quiet about how awfully they treated my friend and put up with the nasty few! Either way I feel awful.   I don’t really know the purpose of this post but I don’t really have any other friends so if I break away from this group I wouldn’t have any left apart from the other excluded friend. I’m not sure they really are my friends anymore as they haven’t been there for me recently so I suspect I’d be next on the chopping block anyway.",0,group friend exclude person stuck between group friend friend life joined past year friend closest went tough time recently decided louder group member not group anymore not making effort drama queen she definitely not extremely judgemental knowing story totally disagreed confronted it loud one argued stayed quiet spoke privately later said agreed me consider friend going forward dilemma good group enjoy spending time like remain friend friend excluded friend feel leave friendship group remain stay quiet awfully treated friend nasty few way feel awful not really know purpose post not really friend break away group not left apart excluded friend not sure really friend anymore not recently suspect chopping block anyway

She had split up with her partner and was struggling to find somewhere to live.

"Every Day is Exactly the Same. I'm Lonely, Worthless, and Done With Life Every day, I wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep. That's basically it. That's my life. Sure, I have a few friends that I see on the weekends, but it only helps so much.  My ex girlfriend broke up with me and moved out of our apartment 6 months ago now. The almost three years we were together were the only time in my life where my depression was pretty much nonexistent. When she came home that day and told me she was done, I was floored. I had no idea that she felt the way she did, and she wouldn't even discuss the matter with me.  I've tried meeting other people since then, and I've gone on exactly three dates with one person. That's it. I'm basically invisible to women, and no amount of effort will ever change that. I just have to accept the reality that I hold absolutely no value in a romantic context. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's because my generation is only interested in people who are aesthetically in the top tier, or make the most money. Maybe it's because my generation is eschewing committed relationships in favor of having fuck buddies left and right, whoring themselves out to whoever will get their rocks off, both men and women are at fault for this. I don't think I'm a particularly unattractive guy, and I make a pretty damn good amount of money for my age, but since I'm not in that top 10% of men, I'm just always going to be passed over and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. It's almost like there something inherent to my existence that prevents me from having any intimacy. No matter how much money I make or how much I improve myself, that intrinsic quality of my being will always hold me back. I didn't ask for this, but it's the way things are, so I've pretty much given up completely.  I don't have any plans of offing myself or anything like that. But every day, it gets harder and harder to convince myself that I actually have anything worth living for. The one thought I keep coming back to is how scared my cat would be if I gave her to a shelter or how she'd get by if I were gone. I love my cat, and she doesn't deserve to be put in a situation like that. I feel like she's the only thing keeping me marginally together. The thought of causing her any distress breaks my heart, and one of the big things on my mind all the time is simply making sure she's happy and feels safe.  I feel worthless and frustrated. I wish I understood how to achieve what I want in life and be happy, but I guess that's just not in the cards. I can't wait until the day I die, I'll finally get some goddamn peace and quiet. I'm so tired of feeling broken. I'm so tired of constantly being reminded that there's something wrong with me, like I'm some sort of bastard aberration of what humans are supposed to be.

"I believe much depression is about a lack of hope 'I don't want to die, I just want to stop existing'  Sound familiar? People just want to end the tedium, the suffering of being conscious.   But most people would be depressed if not for a goal. I think most people would rather not exist than exist if solely to pick cotton in the sun or mine in poor conditions. But people who are not depressed do these things because there's a goal, a reward afterwards. There's a reason to be alive  When 'whats the point?' is part of your mental vernacular and nothing brings a smidge of happiness anymore that driving force disappears  and all it leaves is a depression",1,believe depression lack hope i not want die just want stop existing sound familiar people just want end tedium suffering conscious people depressed not goal think people not exist exist solely pick cotton sun poor condition people not depressed thing goal reward afterwards reason alive whats point mental vernacular brings smidge happiness anymore driving force disappears leaf depression

 Here I am.  Ready to start classes in two days.  I graduate this year.  I should have finished long ago.  But no.  I had to take two years off.  I had to go visit California and Oregon and spend time with Dad instead of being smart and getting a start on my life.   So here I am.  Ready to be me.  Ready to be someone.  Ready to start and finish.  Ready to be done.  Ready to be...what?  What am I trying to be?  Senior year of college.  Criminal Justice major.  I could go to law school.  I could try to become a police officer.  I could just give up this joke and be a social worker.  I guess I'm ready for any of the options.  I have an LSAT score.  I can't get into the school I want with it but I can try again.  Do I want to try again?  Who are these people?  Who are my friends?  Beth thinks we'll go to law school together and be all happy go lucky.  I'm not like Beth.  She's outgoing.  She's a free spirit.  She's ready to be single and alone for three years just to get that freaking degree.  I want something more.  I want to find someone to be happy with.  Then maybe I can be happy with me.  And there's Mike.  What the hell are we anymore?  I know you will read this Mike.  So why don't you tell me what we are?  Just tell me if it's a yes or it's a no because I can't live in limbo like this.  You love me.  You don't want to marry me.  You think I'm sweet.  You think we're good together.  You don't know if you'd be happy with someone else.  What the hell?  But classes start again.  And I'll try some more.  Perhaps this will give me the outlet I need to just be me.

Unreturned texts An old college dorm friend who started organizing reunions I saw twice last year with other former classmates has not responded to my last two texts including a Holiday greeting to him and his family-- which I consider rude. I made it a point to keep in touch with people especially during the holidays. Am tempted to zap this person and drop him but my wife says to let it slide. I would not say we are close but am perplexed at the rudeness of not even mustering a reply to a holiday greeting even if its fake. I've done nothing to this person except it came out during our last group get together that I went on to get a law degree at an elite school. I never even discuss careers or money at these things if that is the reason. Baffling. ,0,unreturned text old college dorm friend started organizing reunion saw twice year classmate not responded text including holiday greeting family consider rude point touch people especially holiday tempted zap person drop wife say let slide not say close perplexed rudeness not mustering reply holiday greeting fake person came group went law degree elite school discus career money thing reason baffling

"Is this friendship normal, and have I done the right thing? Hi everyone,  I am a guy, 19 years old and I live in the Netherlands. A long time ago I managed to become friends with a 16 year old girl who lives in Spain. I already went to visit her once and we are/were very close. She is bisexual and has a 15 year old girlfriend who lives 450 kilometers away from her. I also talk a lot with that girlfriend.  All friendships come with fights, but recently nothing that she does makes sense anymore. It all started when her grandma passed away 6 months ago. She was really close with her, even more then with her parents. Apart from her grandma, sister, her aunt and 2 classmates and me, nobody knows she is dating a girl.   She got very depressed when her grandma died. She was barely happy, she started to get nightmares, she started cutting, and recently she says she also talks with a demon.   She keeps saying stuff like ''only my girlfriend can save me'' and ''only my girlfriend can heal my wounds'' this resulted in that her girlfriend is talking with her almost daily for hours while that girlfriend actually has to study. When her girlfriend didn't pass her exams this year, the girlfriend got the blame for it. While instead she was the one claiming all of her time so that she could be 'fixed'.  This fight caused her to feel even worse and she started to look at video's how to commit suicide and she started to send photo's to her girlfriend of her cuts. This is not something she told me directly, but I heard everything through her girlfriend who was very scared at this point.   One evening she said ''tonight I am going to end my life''. At that moment I contacted her sister and told her everything. Her sister was shocked and assured me she would watch over her. One day she found out that I told her sister when she broke into her phone. She was very angry at me and started making insults and threatened me to end the friendship. Recently she is going to a psychologist and psychiatrist because her sister passed everything on to her parents. They are trying to help her but it doesn't really work so far.  Also in the last 3 weeks her phone was taken by her parents because she wasn't doing her choirs and was always angry. In that time I only talked to her girlfriend in private on whatsapp, not in the group of us 3. And after a week she stole the phone for a moment from her parents and got furious at me saying I should not talk to her girl in a private chat. Only in the groupchat. I did so to stop it from getting worse. Talking for 3 weeks to her girlfriend was loads of fun. Silly texts, talk about all kinds of random stuff and I helped her with some questions on her homework. In those 3 weeks all of her grades went up. And she passed one exam after the other. It was amazing and she thought the same.  2 days ago she got her phone back and the first thing she said was that she was going to make a list of rules for me. If I don't obey those rules she will break the friendship. Some of those rules are: - Don't talk to my girlfriend in private - You are not allowed to visit my girlfriend if I'm not there too - Tell me everything that you are doing every day - If I'm busy talking with my girl, don't disturb us under any circumstances.  I was really angry. I still am. I told her that I don't have any feelings for her girlfriend and that I would never do something to her on purpose. She just doesn't listen. Her girlfriend is also tired of her but she can't say no to her and she doesn't want to break up.  I have some questions:  - Is this normal? - Is it normal what she is doing? - What should her girlfriend do? - Did I do the right thing by telling her sister about her suicide thought, cutting, anxiety, demons and nightmares? It almost costed me my friendship with her.

"Why my relationship is killing me Okay, disclaimer, former relationship... but it still has a huge effect on my life.  This girl was my best friend and my first serious relationship. I met her when I first got depressed, and we went to the same church together.  I told her then that I didn't feel ready for a relationship, but she essentially stalked me all those (5) years ago.  Christmas 2016, after dealing with a crap load more grief and depression, I was essentially forced into a relationship with her.  I had just got over my main stint of depression the previous September, and my life was getting better.  We still hung out as friends, but she kept pushing for more.  However, she is so messed up.  I have to say that now. I do still love her, and that will probably never change, but she needs professional help, and my mistake was thinking I could help her.  She was my best friend after all.  So, after a string of breakups, moving too slow and moving too fast, as well as her cheating on my several times, she finally called it quits one week after my birthday (November just gone). I had no say, because she'd throw a tantrum, but I had to take the initiative.  Why?  Because she no longer wanted to have my baby.  In August, she fell pregnant.  This could have been the week prior the Anniversary of our first kiss, but the nurse dated it on that specific date.  That was one of the nights she cheated on me, with her friend's boyfriend, but it was ""just a kiss"".  She tried to miscarry by drinking heavily for the next few weeks before coming to me about it; she had broken up with me the day after she cheated.  I asked her there and then if she wanted to keep it.  She said yes. We went to speak to my mum.  My mum asked her.  She said yes. She wanted to announce the pregnancy, to start all the planning, and looking forward to the future.  I got a well paying job to provide for our future, a job I travelled hundreds of miles for each week, and it was only for a few months.  But whilst I was away, she decided she missed all the drinking, drugs, and sex she was missing out on.  She wanted to live with her friends (who she actually hates living with at times), and countless other reasons.  However, she kept stringing me along until the scan, where she sent me a photo of our child before telling me she wanted to abort it.  Oh, and I had planned a weekend away for us to relax and see some friends.  She had me believe this was the start of my happy ever after, before ripping it away from me.  She didn't speak to me for two weeks.  When I finally did manage to get in touch, it was to collect my stuff.  I took a mutual friend with me, the act as a buffer, and they couldn't believe the stuff that she said to me.  Then I get a load of hate off her because people are contacting her about her choices. Remember, she has been posting on FB all about the baby, making sure everyone knows.  She hasn't spoken to me since.  She has blocked me anyway she can, even on WhatsApp only recently... not that it matters, because she wants nothing to do with me.  This was my best friend, and my stalker, who for years wanted to be with me, have a family with me, worried I wouldn't want her because of PCOS, and got jealous over people talking to me on Twitter, and kittens!  She couldn't even handle me showing up with chocolates and flowers! All that I've done for her, supported her, sacrificed for her... and this is how she treats me.  Now, I am pro-life, and pro-choice.  I gave her that choice, and she wanted to go ahead.  I didn't force her or convince her.  She led me. She set me up, just to rip out my heart.  Seriously, if you only knew the half of it.  The card she wrote for me for my birthday alone would have anyone convinced.  But now, she is living her life.  She is out drinking, smoking, doing drugs and sleeping with anything she can get her claws into. She has restarted her YouTube ""career"", and quite frankly, they're boring videos.  Maybe she'll do better.  I hope not.  But I think that's normal.  So why this post? Because it is killing me.  I don't know how, but I'm still kicking.  Depression is creeping at my door, and I do have horrible days, bad days where I am so demotivated.  Yet, I cannot stop thinking about her.  She has me broken, in ruins... even my faith has been hit hard. I don't understand what changed.  I don't understand she did what she did.  Why did she play me for so long just to hurt me?  Everyone tells me to forget about her, and no one would allow me to go back to her (even if it was a possibility).  All I want to do is to forget about her, because as the title says... this relationship is killing me.",1,relationship killing okay disclaimer relationship huge effect life girl best friend relationship met got depressed went church together told did not feel ready relationship essentially stalked year ago christmas dealing crap load grief depression essentially forced relationship her just got main stint depression previous september life getting better hung friend kept pushing more however messed up say now love her probably change need professional help mistake thinking help her best friend all so string breakup moving slow moving fast cheating time finally called quits week birthday november just gone say throw tantrum initiative why longer wanted baby august fell pregnant week prior anniversary kiss nurse dated specific date night cheated me friend boyfriend just kiss tried miscarry drinking heavily week coming it broken day cheated asked wanted it said yes went speak mum mum asked her said yes wanted announce pregnancy start planning looking forward future got paying job provide future job travelled hundred mile week month whilst away decided missed drinking drug sex missing on wanted live friend who actually hate living time countless reason however kept stringing scan sent photo child telling wanted abort it oh planned weekend away relax friend believe start happy after ripping away me did not speak week finally did manage touch collect stuff took mutual friend me act buffer not believe stuff said me load hate people contacting choice remember posting fb baby making sure know not spoken since blocked can whatsapp recently not matter want me best friend stalker year wanted me family me worried not want pcos got jealous people talking twitter kitten not handle showing chocolate flower her supported her sacrificed her treat me now prolife prochoice gave choice wanted ahead did not force convince her led me set up just rip heart seriously knew half it card wrote birthday convinced now living life drinking smoking doing drug sleeping claw into restarted youtube career quite frankly boring video maybe better hope not think normal post killing me not know how kicking depression creeping door horrible day bad day demotivated yet stop thinking her broken ruin faith hit hard not understand changed not understand did did did play long just hurt me tell forget her allow even possibility want forget her title say relationship killing me
"My Best Friend Feels More Like My Daughter I love my best friend like family and if anything were to happen to her, you can know I'd be there in an instant. But I feel awful admitting that I really don't like spending time with her anymore.  We're both in our late twenties and I'm sort of the only family she has since she severed ties with her parents (a choice I completely agree was for the best). We've been best friends for the past decade and I've seen her through some really difficult times.  She's faced a lot of struggles, mostly stemming from the terrible relationship she had with her family and the financial burden separating from them put on her life. Unfortunately, many of those struggles are ongoing and have really dominated our friendship. We spend more time talking about her problems than we do hanging out.  I've gotten up at 3:00am to talk with her on the phone because she had a nightmare and she's scared. I've left my job early to go help her because she left hers early in tears. Days that are supposed to be fun (a movie, a game night, making dinner together) end up with me supporting her because she's upset about something, and suddenly the whole evening is gone. I don't want to exaggerate, but I'd say 70% of the times I see her I have to go into ""support mode.""  And unfortunately, I've realized that I don't enjoy her as a friend and I honestly don't think I ever will again. The dynamic of our friendship has changed and it's never going to be what it was. Don't get me wrong, I care deeply for her and want to be there for her if she needs me, but the fact of that matter is I've found myself not reaching out to her anymore because it's just not a pleasant experience. When we do hang out, it's not because I want to; it's because I feel that's what she needs. She's a burden. She's a burden I bear willingly. But she's a burden.  I don't know what to do. I really wish there were an easy way to say ""I don't like you anymore, so please don't be hurt that I don't reach out, but god you don't know how much I care about you.""",0,best friend feel like daughter love best friend like family happen her know instant feel awful admitting really not like spending time anymore late twenty sort family severed tie parent a choice completely agree best best friend past decade seen really difficult time faced lot struggle stemming terrible relationship family financial burden separating life unfortunately struggle ongoing really dominated friendship spend time talking problem hanging out gotten am talk phone nightmare scared left job early help left early tear day supposed fun a movie game night making dinner together end supporting upset something suddenly evening gone not want exaggerate say time support mode unfortunately realized not enjoy friend honestly not think again dynamic friendship changed going wa not wrong care deeply want need me fact matter not reaching anymore just not pleasant experience hang out not want to feel need burden burden bear willingly burden not know do really wish easy way say i not like anymore not hurt not reach out god not know care you
"Family Problems - kicked out now moving out Issue:  I have found myself unable to speak to my parents about anything. I have found, when I have problems, thinking  of doing something new like get a job, am sick or just news about school or just talk want to talk about everday things that I go to speak to other family members, friends, or counselors before them who I felt more comfortable with, which would then get my parents irritated, and upset  and make me even less likely to talk to them about anything because of how they reacted to me.  This has been going on for years   Except now it has gotten a lot worse.   When I have important things to tell them about, such as news about school ( be it grades, tuition, classes etc ) appointments, invitations to a friend's wedding, or pretty much anything of that sort, I leave it to the last minute. Even thinking about telling them anything makes me feel extremely nervous - my heart speeds up and there's a pressure in my chest, I tremble, get headaches . As soon as I do talk to them I panic and change the topic to ask about something else, zone out , or I can't speak clearly at all.  Because of my inability to tell them anything  or even socialize with them has caused  us to drift far apart. I am  usually one to talk  and My parents dont strike up conversation with and if I somehow must up the courage to do so I feel like they don't hear me and are quick to talk of all my shortcoming. ( My mom often talk about me negatively to her friends and y other relatives  sometimes where I can hear) Anyways It doesn't go well. If they start the conversation it on a bad note . I have then avoided my family even more because of how they make me feel.  I merely  come home from school , do my chores and homework and staying  in my bedroom ad stay out of their way.  I have to admit I am not a perfect child, I have given my share of attitude etc. But I believe that most of it was because I am couldn't express how I felt or wanted to say or what I was thinking and wanted to expected them to know.  While I don't drugs or curse, stay out late, outright disobey the. Etc acting this is considered disrespectful to them.  At first,I just assumed it was a teenage phase a little bit worse than normal but I guess normal has been ruled out since I spend longs time in the bathroom to avoid them, hiding behind doors, flinching when I am talked to or even walking around different parts of the house to pretend I am doing something among other things .  I don't know why I am like this. Or how I got like this( well maybe I have some idea) but I can't shake it. I have been advised to 'just go talk to them' but that is the very thing I cannot do! I don't think they understand how much pain this causes me when I have to gather my courage to even speak to them to ask for advice, and they rebuff me even now. I need some advice about how to proceed and handle this I have no more courage in me, low self esteem and probably some other things. I feel that my parents are not emotionally ..um supportive or open.. are so judgmental and critical I just can't.  I've become isolating towards friends, restless at night and start eating all the time or not much at all.   There are a  few events that I think really hurt me and thus  contributed to the problem overtime.  examples: (Younger) they threaten to bring to boarding school and my mom even brings me to tell police station to proceed with the plan.   - memorable beating from incident  - memorable punishment of not letting me eat for a few days because I refuse to eat a seasme seed bun ( had sensitivity too, found out after)  - memorable punishment mom knnew I was extremely afriad of the dark made me sit in the dark in the living roomfor hours of the night. - I was also left at home frequently ( with no cable , no internet) and missed out on many holiday events with family and outings. I cried a lot at first but overtime I learned to occupy myself with my own company. My mom would also leave me to clean the house as well. - little ""treasured"" things like cool pencils or little toys would be taken away.i don't know why but I never asked for them back, even afterwards nor would they give them back to me.  (older) - Running away to school placement - struggling to secure financial assistance from my parents to help pay for my tuition. Scared the I have to drop out. -threatening to donate all my work earnings - and kicking me out of the house with no belongings.  I have been torn between leaving and staying. Especially again with being cut off from my siblings as my stepdad prevent me from interacting with them after that.   I finally left after a fight with my mom last week ( which included a rule on two day noticed before going anywhere... and talk to a worker about ending my life , which resulted her call the house concerned for my safety. Mom didnt take it very well and kicked me out)   I have left and i'm trying work things out with myself and try to get better which is something I cannot do at home.  I am staying with a friend, and hoping to rent a room , get a job and go for counselling soon.   However, They are now feeling bad me and are asking me to come back home ( which includes some guilt tripping- crying, using religion ( must obey parents, not put mother in hardship, will be held accountable) , younger siblings- not being able to see them, and now tell other relatives)  I have been saying that i am not ready to comeback home ( although i am not really interested in going back, well other than being with my younger siblings whom i miss )   I have no intention of trashing anybody, i love them, the raised me. I just think it would better to reconcile and work things out from a distance.  I dont know how to deal with all of this.",0,family problem kicked moving issue unable speak parent anything found problem thinking doing new like job sick just news school just talk want talk everday thing speak family member friend counselor felt comfortable with parent irritated upset make likely talk reacted me going year gotten lot worse important thing tell about news school grade tuition class appointment invitation friend wedding pretty sort leave minute thinking telling make feel extremely nervous heart speed pressure chest tremble headache soon talk panic change topic ask else zone speak clearly all inability tell socialize caused drift far apart usually talk parent dont strike conversation courage feel like not hear quick talk shortcoming mom talk negatively friend y relative hear anyways doe not well start conversation bad note avoided family make feel merely come home school chore homework staying bedroom ad stay way admit not perfect child given share attitude etc believe not express felt wanted say thinking wanted expected know not drug curse stay late outright disobey the acting considered disrespectful them firsti just assumed teenage phase little bit worse normal guess normal ruled spend longs time bathroom avoid them hiding door flinching talked walking different part house pretend doing thing not know like this got like this maybe idea shake it advised just talk them thing do not think understand pain cause gather courage speak ask advice rebuff now need advice proceed handle courage me low self esteem probably thing feel parent not emotionally um supportive open judgmental critical just cannot isolating friend restless night start eating time not all event think really hurt contributed problem overtime example younger threaten bring boarding school mom brings tell police station proceed plan memorable beating incident memorable punishment not letting eat day refuse eat seasme seed bun sensitivity too after memorable punishment mom knnew extremely afriad dark sit dark living roomfor hour night left home frequently cable internet missed holiday event family outing cried lot overtime learned occupy company mom leave clean house well little treasured thing like cool pencil little toy taken awayi not know asked back me older running away school placement struggling secure financial assistance parent help pay tuition scared drop out threatening donate work earnings kicking house belonging torn leaving staying especially cut sibling stepdad prevent interacting that finally left fight mom week included rule day noticed going anywhere talk worker ending life resulted house concerned safety mom didnt kicked out left trying work thing try better home staying friend hoping rent room job counselling soon however feeling bad asking come home includes guilt tripping cry using religion obey parent not mother hardship held accountable younger sibling not able them tell relative saying not ready comeback home not really interested going back younger sibling miss intention trashing anybody love them raised me just think better reconcile work thing distance dont know deal this

Let me introduce myself first. Currently im a 19yo boy who turns 20 in March, I live in Belgium (grammar will be bad sorry).  I have 1 older brother,  2 loving parents who are still together. And oh yeahh i have a very cute pupper as well. Financially everything is fine.  Basically a family some people only can dream for. I mainly play on nintendo consoles (switch, 3ds, gba, n64) and the MMORPG runescape (dont laugh :)) I consider myself a extravert to my friends but an introvert when im talking to girls (lol) or strangers.  I've always had a rough time fitting at school. Our elementary school was VERY SMALL, it only had 75 kids (including kindergarden). I was always the ""odd one out"", but because it was so small i had 1 friend. We played alot together and it was a ok time really. but when i was 5 most people around me started to notice that i made weird random noises. And that i made small movements with my shoulders (unnatural ones). Friends got annoyed, parents got annoyed, everyone got annoyed. Eventually my teacher screamed at me telling me to shut up, RIP ME.  Eventually mom took me to a specialist and it turned out i have Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, if you youtube this you will get extreme cases where people shout fuck and ass, and move uncontrollably all over the place. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH ME. I think Tourette affected my life ALOT (it still does!!). I was always a really shy kid until i was 11, i started to accept my tourettes and was a happy 11yo. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **HIGH SCHOOL** (from 12 to 18yo, its devided in 6 ""classes"".  This is where the problems started, when i just started high school i was scared but excited like everyone. Unfortunately for me i got the SHITTIEST bullies in my class. I had no friends in year 1, they made fun of me becuz of my tourettes (i didnt tell them becuz they wouldnt understand). It got to a point where i just smacked someone on the head with a baseball bat. Teachers knew of my situation so we both got 1 week detention. I was ""depressed"" during that year, you know the teenage life, its hard. Year 2 they changed me to another class and they were OK. They didnt bully me but they didnt talk to me either. They just left me alone really, during those 2 years i had 1 friend who i talked with but he also had his own friends. So most of the time i was alone. But that friend had no common interests, so i ended up playing runescape all day, u can talk with other players there and i had plenty of friends in there. It felt awesome to have friends and i spent all my time there neglecting my studies. But somehow i passed  the first 2 years lol.  I thought year 1 was bad, but then i met year 3 (different school). I got bullied even more in this class, they called me names, ignored me, humiliated me in class and started bitching if they had to sit next to me. Luckily they never got fysical with me (idk if thats the right word). In the middle of that year I decided   in the middle of the fucking winter (it was snowing) in morning to take the bus (mom was always home and it was near our house) and to step of early. Spent 2 hours in a small freezing cold chapel playing on my nintendo 3ds, go to my house after mom left and spend playing games in my room.  After 3 days the school called, my mom found out. I was stuck and told her everything about the bullying, about me feeling like absolute shit and that i had no motivation to go to school. She let the teachers know, went to school, got me to a psychiatrist. The bullying stopped, but they still ignored me, i still hadnt any friends and i still didnt feel any better. I somehow survived the 4 next months and passed. If i had 1.1% lower in total i would have failed that year.  The only way i felt better was with playing runescape.  YEAR 4-6 IS IN THE SAME CLASS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE, in year 5 three people joined Year 4 kinda went the same as year 2 believe it or not. The classmates were ok, they didnt bully me, they talked to me when needed but that was it. I spent my time with some kids i met on the playground. But u know they were those kind of friends u just spent time with becuz nobody else is around. They never invited me to go to parties or to hang around or anything. This year was also the 1st year i told them about my Tourette Syndrome ( i got some damn weird looks at times and i didnt even realize i was making sounds). They understood, they acted more nice to me, i didnt feel left out so much but was still unhappy. And on runescape i got into a community (clan), made some good friends there. It was the only place in the word i was truly happy.   Year 5, same class as last year. 3 people joined and 1 of them became a friend of mine. To be completely honest he is still one of my best friends today, but i come back to that later. Lets call him J, Ok so now i had a friend. We had a small group of 3 people now, S (other classmate who was nice to me), J and me. 2 others from another class joined the group somehow and i finally made some friends. We started going to parties and they invited me. Unlucky for me they dont play runescape and have different interests in gaming, thanks to this im not that close to them. But i was finally starting to be happy becuz i had friends.  All the small things that bothered me (sitting alone, always last chosen at sports etc etc...), bothered me alot less becuz i was super happy i finally found something positive in my life. I survived year 5 and 6 fairly positive compared to year 1 and 3. We all graduated and college time arrived ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **COLLEGE** This was last year, so this is super recent. I decided to study ""orthopedagogie"", it doesnt have an english translation. Its working with mentally disabled people or troubled young people, stuff like that. Ofcourse I begged my parents for a student room, i wanted to have a great college life like in the movies! Everyone says its the best time of your life and you should enjoy it to the fullest. Oh boy i was so so dumb for believing it would be that easy. And ofcourse i also joined a society. Finally growing up like an adult and living alone, I WAS FREEEEEEEEEEE. In my class i got along with most of them, we had some good laughs during breaks, went to our class etc... but i was the only one who had a student room (unlucky). So ye that was that. In my society i tried making friends, but it didnt work out really. I missed some first important parties becuz i decided to go with some classmates (i still think to this day that this was a huge mistake), when i went to parties alone to make friends  (because i realized my class was lame) they already a ""friend group"". I didnt know (and still dont) how to make contact with them and make friends.  I was really really really lonely last year, i just spent all my time playing runescape, talking with my online friends. November 2016 i met someone and we became super super super super close. (he is american, not lovers just friends). We still talk to each other everyday. Man we even were planning to go to japan together but my mom wont let me. But coming back to that later. During the weekends i had my old friend group from highschool, we still hang out 2x per month, we still do. But they mostly spent time studying and hanging out with their uni friends. They didnt left me out or anything but i had lost alot of contact with them. I failed 50% of my courses, i decided to call it quits. I was happy that i could finally leave that student room. uni year 1 was HORRIBLE.  I liked the study i was doing, so i decided to try it again but in a lower degree, its in a school for adults (18+). Its hard to explain but basically i ended up with 60% out of 20 people to be 30+ and have kids. It was class 1x a week and internship (idk if thats the right word) 2.5 days per week. I was working with adults who had a mental disability. Last year i never had internship, only class. It turns out that Orthopedagogie is not the study for me. I dont want to do this the rest of my life. I had officially quit november 2017.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  We finally arrived to the present time, thank you for the people that made it here.   So here i am, a 19 year old boy (almost 20), wasted 1.5 years in uni, wasting parents money... I have no idea what i want to study next... The only study i consider doing is social work, luckily for me u can start in february. So i have to do some shitty job from november - february. I still have my highschool friends who i hang out with 2x per month? I have a loving brother and parents, good financial situation. I can earn some quick cash for 3 months and go back to study. But to be completely honest... I DONT SEE THE FUCKING POINT.  My whole life i have felt lonely, sometimes with a good reason, sometimes really without a reason. I have dealt with ""depression"" (not officially diagnosed), or atleast felt like i was.  To be completelty honest. I feel like a sad little fucking sack of shit. What have i achieved in my life? Fucking nothing. I cant even think like a fucking normal person, people think im weird, i dont have logical sense. Everyday i have to force myself out of bed. Its been like this for so long now that im starting to get used to it. Even now that i dont have a job until feb, i simply dont have the strength to get out of bed. I sleep 12 hrs per day just so the day passes by faster.  I dont feel like going out, i dont feel like talking to people. Runescape was always my escape, but i simply do not have the motivation to even play runescape . On the outside i still act normal, i laugh and act like everything is fine so my parents wont worry. Whenever i have a job they fire me because ""i work to slow"". Once i worked in a storage for a store and had to get the order from customers. You have to use ""common sense"" all the time, and they said i didnt have that enough for this job. This happened 3x...   Remember when i said that i have tourette syndrome, well i always told myself that it also does have a ""mental"" side to it. I can come across different then the ""normal person"", or use the wrong word in sentences to express myself. And i interpret things differently at times, i usually need to hear the explanation multiple times and they have to explain it very clearly.  My parents just said im a slow learner but with ""hard work i get there"". This fucked me over so many times in life, and whenever i tell people/friends about the mental side of tourette they all have that expression on their face. The face of ""ohh that explains alot, but i also feel so sorry for you"". Im so fucking sick of it, im not even sure if this happens becuz of my tourette. Im really starting to think this is just all in my head and that im just retarded. (my iq is average tho). I often imagine myself having some disorder to make myself feel better, i really dont know what to do with myself. I feel like an absolute loser who cant even think like a normal person. Last 6 months i bought myself a nintendo switch + some games to cheer myself up. it gets me trough some days but in the end i still end up having no energy to get out of bed.  BUT i feel like an arrogant asshole writing this, i have nothing to complain about... Alot of people had the worst childhood, or had a traumatic experience... I have a family many people can only dream of? financially im good. I have the chance to try studying again.... I HAVE NO REASON TO FEEL THIS WAY AND IT MAKES ME GO INSANE. Im having alot of negative thoughts, and i cant get them out of my head. I dont see the light in the end of the tunnel. (Not stuff like suicide or self cutting btw).  As i said earlier i met someone a year ago trough rs. I can always talk to him, i never met him in person but we discord at times and message each other everyday. I feel more connected to him than my IRL friends. They have no same interests, other life goals... How sad is that? Fkn someone i met online is my best friend? He is the only 1 that knows how i feel but he doesnt understand how i feel. He tries to support me, but it doesnt help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Im not making this post so everyone feels bad for me.... Im just so sick of life... I dont know what to do... My parents have their own problems and think im over exaggerating... ""Grow up son? Everyone has to get a job"" ""Grow up for once"". But they dont know what it feel like to drag yourself trough the whole day 24/7 (atleast i hope they dont). They think im just lazy and dont want to work... I feel isolated from the world and i cant get out of it.  Ok god damnit im re-reading this post, at this point im just rambling... Idk what i expect from posting this here... Maybe its just to give my empty brain a boost...  I will just end this post now or i keep adding stuff.

"Just venting Not sure the general gist of where this post is going but I just kind of want to write down my thoughts. I tend to feel better after I do so. Maybe along with that I can have the added bonus of affecting somebody else in a positive way with what I say or that someone else understands what I'm saying.   I'm alone as I type this. I'm sure many people who frequent this sub would describe themselves in that way. I feel over the years I've been getting more and more depressed. I was depressed when in my teens then I hit a lull in my 20s where I just didn't care about much and put things out of mind. Now, I seem to be at a combination of both. A kind of dead, feel nothing type of feeling mixed in with depression. I've been getting angrier as well. Bitter and resentful. I feel like when I was a teen I just thought strongly that I wasn't very great in the general sense. I feel like I now know that to be true. After enough life experience and enough time with yourself you start to see who and what you are.   Needless to say I don't like who I am. Maybe you don't either. I'm not as strong, wise, caring, compassionate, friendly, hard-working, courageous, generous, et fuckin cetera that I'd like. ""Well, why don't you change?""  Cause I clearly don't fuckin want to.   Maybe I enjoy being depressed? Because obviously I've laid out terms, so to speak, for me to be depressed. Not courageous, hard enough working, kind etc etc. Yet, I don't do shit about it. So why complain as if I'm depressed because of it? I think that's where the day to day numb feeling comes in. It's like ""I am this way. I don't like being this way. I don't change being this way. Why tf are you even upset?""   I really don't feel I deserve what I have in my life. Like the organ donor program I feel I'd want to give my body to someone else. Maybe they can make better use of my fully functional legs. My vision. Ever see those people do an absolute fuck ton of things with their life? Those people who are so driven to accomplish a b c d e f g... Every day of their life and they only have 1 limb? Are blind? Live in abject poverty?  I have NONE of these fucking hurdles. I, in fact, don't have anything anyone would legitimately call a hurdle in life and yet I feel depressed.   It's probably justified that I feel this way. I don't do anything to try and feel better and I don't capitalize on advantages I have in my life to make things better. To grow as a person. I don't do that for myself let alone for other people. And yet I want to have success.. I want to have profound love. Meaning and purpose. What a joke Just wish I could hit the fast forward button on this shit and get through with it. Oh right.. There's suicide. But even that holds it's own unique stigma to it. Next to no one would recommend you do that. It's not an ideal solution. So on and so forth. But you kind of have to admit that those that do go through with it... It's as if you can't question them. You can't question their pain. Can't question their sense of guilt or anguish or depression and sadness. They solidified it and made it real moreso than practically anyone could ever do when alive.   Sometimes I wonder if those that commit suicide do so because it's either a) the only perceived way out of their grief or b) that it effectively proves to others beyond a shadow of a doubt what kind of hell they had been living through in the years leading up to doing it.  You can never question someone who killed themselves as to whether their pain was real. Not just in the sense that they're no longer around to ask but that no one would ask what everyone inherently knows. Of course they felt pain. I feel that might be suicides greatest allure. It effectively puts a stamp on your sadness as legitimate.  I've thought about it a lot throughout my life. I don't think I'd ever have the stones to do it. Maybe my life or state of mind just isn't that bad. Not yet anyways.   Kind of a long read :/   Hi to all those that like reading long posts from internet randoms 👋 ",1,just venting not sure general gist post going just kind want write thought tend feel better so maybe added bonus affecting somebody positive way say understands saying type this sure people frequent sub way feel year getting depressed depressed teen hit lull s just did not care thing mind now combination both kind dead feel type feeling mixed depression getting angrier well bitter resentful feel like teen just thought strongly not great general sense feel like know true life experience time start are needle say not like am maybe not either not strong wise caring compassionate friendly hardworking courageous generous et fuckin cetera like well not change cause clearly not fuckin want to maybe enjoy depressed obviously laid term speak depressed not courageous hard working kind etc yet not shit it complain depressed it think day day numb feeling come in like i way not like way not change way tf upset really not feel deserve life like organ donor program feel want body else maybe make better use fully functional leg vision people absolute fuck ton thing life people driven accomplish b c d e f g day life limb blind live abject poverty fucking hurdle i fact not legitimately hurdle life feel depressed probably justified feel way not try feel better not capitalize advantage life make thing better grow person not let people want success want profound love meaning purpose joke just wish hit fast forward button shit it oh right suicide hold unique stigma it recommend that not ideal solution forth kind admit it question them question pain ca not question sense guilt anguish depression sadness solidified real moreso practically alive wonder commit suicide a perceived way grief b effectively prof shadow doubt kind hell living year leading doing it question killed pain real not just sense longer ask ask inherently know course felt pain feel suicide greatest allure effectively put stamp sadness legitimate thought lot life not think stone it maybe life state mind just not bad not anyways kind long read hi like reading long post internet randoms

"I feel doubts about my relationship when I'm depressed? I'm 25/M. I'm gay and I've been with my boyfriend J for five months.  I used to be severely depressed. But lately my life has been pretty good. But sometimes I get into a depressed mood and I start having doubts about my relationship.  Honestly nothing is really wrong between us. But sometimes I feel like I don't really love him, and that we don't actually have any chemistry. And I don't know why I feel that way. I start nitpicking our relationship and try to find flaws in it to justify how I feel.  But other times we'll both be in a good mood, and the spark is totally there, and I feel great about everything.  I'm starting to think that this is just what my brain defaults to when I'm sad, and that there's nothing actually wrong with us. For example this weekend I was feeling great, then on Sunday my parents had a conversation with me that really triggered me, and now I'm feeling depressed and doubting my relationship. (The conversation with my parents had nothing to do with my boyfriend.)  Basically it seems like whenever I feel down, my brain immediately jumps to ""maybe I should break up with my boyfriend."" I don't know if this is a sign that something is actually wrong, or if this is just what a depressed brain does.   Does anyone else experience this? Is this common?

"Sister wants to live in Costa Rica So I have some questions about this, my sister has a 2 year old and is getting no child support. She wants to sell her stuff and drive to Costa Rica to live there.

" This is dedicated to my uncle, who died on duty at the age of 29, doing police work...       The Day I Cried   ------------------------------------            “Those that I fight I do not hate,        Those that I guard I do not love;”  - (An Irish Airman Foresees His Death, W.B. Yeats)      It was all white in the room,    The corpse in his winding sheet,    My aunt in a new white sari,    Staring into the silence where he had gone.    I could hear the leaves rustle outside the window, But I didn’t cry.      She had gone crazy, my mom whispered,    Between her sobs, “She is just 25, the poor girl”    I just continued to look down,    At the mosaic floor, not registering a word.    I could hear the white saris softly flapping, But I couldn’t cry.      My cousin sister came to me,    Dressed in her prettiest frock for the occasion.    She was five, did she understand?    I took her out to buy her chocolate.    I could hear the neighbors’ shushing as we went by, But I still didn’t cry.      On my way back in the train,    Three passengers were discussing the police,    “All corrupt sons of bitches – they deserve to die”    I remembered you, uncle, so proud of your uniform.

" It's amazing what some people will do for fun and excitement. Although, in telling about this I incriminate myself. But anyway.  So we all (a group of people...I guess as opposed to dogs, cats, aliens, or rubber duckies) decided we wanted to take a walk along the canal. However, the weather decided it was going to rain at the same time. Now, rain would usually stop a sane person from taking a walk outside, but no...no one ever said we were sane. So we walked...in the rain and lightning and thunder...with umbrellas held high...all in the name of fun (and, oh yeah...exercise).  My official battle cry was, ""It's just water.""  Hmm...it's a shame we don't go out and play in the rain more.

" So...I didn't lose any weight last week. This is not surprising, being that I had the most bizarre cravings, and thus binged a few times. I didn't gain weight, so I'm not going to complain too much...So still...we're at 233. I dunno what the hell is wrong with me, but I'm actually going to call a doctor. I've got to be hella sick or feel really damn bad to even consider such a thing. But I hurt, I've been up all night, and the shit has got to stop. Drugs...that's what I need.  Bucky. Hehe, what can I say besides that? I absolutely cannot believe the whirlwind of feeling and emotion that has come to me as a result of him. Last weekend was so, so wonderful. I miss him so much. I never, ever intended to fall in love or to let emotion get involved. I mean, how taboo is it to see a married man? However, when the said couple is poly....I mean, why not? He says he can love me and love Megan too, and that he isn't going anywhere. So I'm just going to have fun, enjoy the ride for as long as it lasts, and hopefully, learn from the experiences. Regardless, I love him. It's been a long time since I felt love for a man. It's hard to admit to myself, but I do want him, and to a certain extent, maybe I even think that I need him. There is some connection there that I can't put my finger on. I've no idea what it is...maybe a past life or something.  Anyway, onto the doctor callings I go.

"Is this my fault? I've been on SSI ever since high school but before high school I wasn't. My oldest aunt suggest to me to get SSI but let's call her Cancer Rat because her zodiac sign is a Cancer. I was like ""Nah, I'm good for now"" because I'm lazy I didn't feel like doing that but I didn't tell my aunt that! SO, she took it the wrong way and start yelling BLAH, BLAH THIS and BLAH, BLAH THAT. My mom was like ""Cancer Rat you cannot get mad because she decided not to do that!"" Cancer Rat gotten more mad ""I'm not mad, I was just saying."" I gotten tired of her yelling because she can't get her way. I was like ""Mom, let's just do it so Cancer Rat can shut the FUUUUUCK UP!""    My mom was like ""Ok, let's just do it. Let's get it over with."" The thing is ever since then I was in 3rd or 4th grade the relationship between Cancer Rat and I went down hill! I stopped going to church with is where is start going down hill. She got mad because I stopped going to church with her. From time to time Cancer Rat will bring it up to manipulate me to have me feel guilty about it but I caught on to it. She makes fun of my weight, hair, clothes I wear, what I eat and drink, just everything like she's overdramatic about every fucking thing I do but I'm probably ain't the only one though. It's so bad that I can't even read a story on the Wattpad without her bitch ass accusing me of texting a boy when I wasn't! She probably hates when I play video games. In 2016 she called me mentally retarded and said I don't think straight but I don't know why and if I ask her why she said that to me that she'll just lie, lie, lie of why she said it. She gets overdramatic when she's the last to find out shit or when you stop telling her shit, stop talking to her. I stop telling shit because you'll tell her not to say anything to anyone that she'll do it anyways. She did all of this ever since I was in 3rd or 4th grade and still is til this day..     Now you know my back story with Cancer Rat.   Ever since 2014 I started to use Bitcoins and the only person knows I use it is my mom at the time but my brother started to find out and he ended up founding out. From 2014 to 2017 I will lose Bitcoins and wins or earn Bitcoins! Just like if I were to use the trade market, you'll win or lose some. In 2018 I wanted to make history by making thousands of dollars from a $29.00 Bitcoin investment and I did. The problem is that Cancer Rat daughter, let's call her Tuna Fish in her 30's. So I made 2 mil but the household only knew about it. Until I made a big mistake by making a youtube video about my 2 mil and shared the video to my Facebook! The mistake was sharing it to my Facebook page. Here's the thing…Tuna Fish love to lurk on people Facebook pages using her husbands account and I wasnt paying attention until after my aunt Cancer Rat confronted me about my earnings 3 days after I shared the link to my Facebook.   Cancer Rat yell and cussed at me that accused me of using SSI money to earn my 2 mil, that I did it behind everyone's back, that I didn't even bother to let her help, that I was being greedy, I didn't even bother to tell her, that she had heard it through someone else how they showed her proof, that the person had showed her a video of it, she's disappointed in me, she will forgive but won't forget, and that she feels lefted out. Here's the thing I did use SSI to get the 2 mil because back in 2015 and 2016 that Cancer Rat b•tch ass sent a letter to them told a false story how I barely go places, that my mom have to do all the work, that I'm mentally retarded, that I rage on video games, other sh•t that I can't remember and one of the update application for SSI that Cancer Rat lied to them and said that I was in a wheel chair when I never was.   So that's when I started to think that she might trying to get them to cut me off and thats why I used $29.00 of my SSI money to get the 2 mil as back up like I didn't think it was a big deal. It wasn't my fault to me because I wasn't the one sending letters trying to get someone cut off but my mom told me to not say anything about the letters when we had first found out and today is day to confront Cancer Rat. I had to do it. Now Cancer Rat wants to try and tell me what to do. She says ""Girl, whatever I say to you is for the best. Whatever you did to make that 2 mil that I want you to stop doing it because it's not fair that you made your first 1 mil before your 21st birthday. You didn't do anything specially to get it. I mean like you SAT ON YOUR ASS!"" She was pissed but I don't give a fuck.  I said ""I had to do what I gotta do! It's not my fault that it happen. The reason why I turn $29 to 2 mil is because some bitch trying to sabotage my SSI by sending in false letters and I wonder who? Now you're mad because I made 2 mil before my 21st birthday OMG!"" so Cancer Rat yell and cussed at me that she said ""I KNOW YOU USED YOUR FUUUUUCKING SSI MONEY TO EARN THAT 2 MIIIIIILLLLLLLLL AND YOU USED 29 FUUUUUCKING DOLLLLLLARS! YOU DID IT BEHIND EVERYONE'S BAAAAAACK! YOU DIDN'T EVEN FUUUUUCKING BOTHER TO LET ME HELP YOUUUUUUU! YOU WAS BEING GREEEEDY! YOU DIDN'T EVEN FUUUUUCKING TO TELL MEEEEEEEE! I HAD TO HEAR IT THROUGH SOMEONE ELLLLLLLSE! THEY SHOWED ME PROOOOOOF! THEY SHOULD ME A VIDEO OF IIIIIIIIIIIT! I FEEL SO FUUUUUCKING LEFT OUUUUUUUUT! I'M SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU GIIIIIIIIIIIIRL! I'LL FORGIVE BUT I WON'T FUUUUUCKING FORGET THIS."" After Cancer Rat stopped yelling that I was about to say something but my mom beat me to the punch.   My mom said ""Cancer Rat, how is my daughter greeeeedy when you're the only one complaining about the money like she didn't even do anything wrong at all?"" Cancer Rat got so fucking fed up that she stopped her ass out our fucking house and slam our f•cking door but while Cancer Rat and her daughter Tuna Fish was leaving that they shook their fucking heads at me!!   Another thing before I started to use Bitcoins that this household was very poor. Trying to make ends meet. Barely trying to keep the food in the house. What made it worse when Cancer Rat and Cancer Rat daughter Tuna Fish (Cancer Rat have 2 other sons but they always in the streets doing who knows what), Cancer Rat grandkids Mices always bragging about money, money, MONEY everytime they come over to our house. ""Look we went and bought this"", ""We went and bought that."", ""We went and spent this much money."", ""We went and spent that much money."" They knew we was poor. So I asked them ""Why everytime y'all come over here that y'all somehow brag about money?"" They was like ""GIIIIIIIRL ain't nobody trying to brag about money. Are you mad that you cant buy video games all the time LMFAO!!""  Always make fun of me about that.   June 3rd, 2018 I will be 21 years old.   Here's my question about the 2 mil and everything that ➡Is this my fault? Am I in the wrong here because I used $29 of my SSI money to earn my 2 mil, that I did it behind everyone's back apparently, that I didn't even bother to let her help me apparently, that I was being greedy apparently, I didn't even bother to tell her apparently?

"The world needs more ""lollipop moments"". Back in middle school, I was helping out at a sunday school, tutoring primary kids. There was this adorable little girl who was struggling to sing the right tunes of a hymn. Even though I have absolutely no musical background, I tried to help her get her vocals and lyrics right by singing the hymn together. Eventually, I told her to continue repeating it herself and that every practice is an improvement from the last.   She would call me frequently just to sing her new hymns and I would challenge her to learn a new hymn every week, this routine went on for quite a while between ourselves...  Fast forward to today, I'm currently a struggling undergrad students coping with depression and stress and well as deteriorating health due to extreme fatigue. Bad grades and crippling financial debt are the least of my concerns. Many days I would feel tired and unmotivated to do anything... and barely making it to lectures only to zone off. At days I would think of suicide as well. There was nobody I could turn to that I felt I could relate to or even understand me...  It was not until a few days ago I received an email from the girl's mother, the girl was unfortunately diagnosed with an illness that made her lose up to 90% of her hearing. However, she was recently accepted to a prestigious musical academy, and sent me the audition tape of her performance thanking me for my encouragement. That song that she performed, was the very first hymn she struggled when I first came up to her.   Knowing that the girl went through so much hardship just to chase the dream I stimulated her from her youth gave me so much hope at the darkest point of my life. Knowing that I had the capacity to influence a big change in a little girls life gave me the purpose to live. Even though I had to wait for 8 years for this news, it was worth it.  TL;DR  We all have the ability to give small act of kindness which goes a long way. From putting a smile on your face to giving away your coat to cover a pair of cold shoulders, dont underestimate the impact it has to them in the present and the future.

" an online journal sounds intriguing, if only to keep my thoughts in order. i have long ago given up writing in my journal due to the illegible scribble that is my long hand. the past few years would have made for some good reading and I will regret not having those thoughts to look back on. i suppose i have my memory but even that seems to be failing me in my old age or thru all the drama. drama isn't neccessarily negative but tonight i am wishing for a somewhat drama free past. tonight when i scan the postings of my name via the web, i come accross a memorial to him. someone in his High school class found out that he is dead and they are looking for stories in regards to their beloved fellow student. i sit here, at this desk and the air leaves my chest and isn't replaced for what seems like a great while. a connection to him. a connection to my soul. i miss him so much, i miss my husband, i miss nobles father. i miss sharing with him. laughing. i don't laugh so much anymore and i used to live for laughter. now when i do it seems empty and hollow. i feel fake when i am laughing. maybe the drugs will remedy that. maybe when i laugh again i will feel some connection. maybe this wonder drug will connect it all back in my brain again, but for now it seems all disconnected and although i have pretended that i have been on track for the past few years, i am a liar. my mantra has been ""it's OK"" well it fucking isn't ok, far from OK. i want to tell people that but when i do they run from me. i am always to be the STRONG woman. the strong LEADER. How imressed they all are by my resilliance. well guess what mother fuckers? it is fake. i am crumbling and you don't even know it or if you do, you don't care enough to say a thing. stay away and SUZY will pop back up like a wilted peace lily getting a much needed drink. i wish i could tell them that i am angry and that they too will understand my life when they watch their husbands die of cancer. watch as the man that you love dies while his baby grows in your belly. i was cheated. i was robbed and i have tried to make the best of it. i have waited for the best...it is alluding me. i just want some understanding, a strong shoulder to lay my head upon so that i can rest. i am tired of holding myself up. i am tired of running the show. i am exhausted and weary. where is my stamina in the form of a human?

I truly feel it’s getting worse every year and I feel I will never have a normal life or be successful because of them. Therapy doesn’t work on me, and medications may work some but only for a short time. My thoughts on suicide and self harm are getting worse also.

"Anhedonia.. anyone else experience it? I just want to vent and have some insight.   I never ""fall"" in love anymore. I'm lucky if I can even feel love. My current boyfriend is so supportive, but as the past few years of my life, just can't fall in love.   I don't feel the own love or care for my family or friends. I don't care if something happened to my friends, and I don't care if I never see my loving, caring parents again for a long time, or ever. I don't care to help friends or family with anything.   I have no passions in life. I have no hobbies. I'm not passionate about my family, friends, work, school, boyfriend, hobbies, my Jeep, animals, etc.. NOTHING excites me, brings me happiness or joy or peace. OCD, anhedonia and depression control everything.   The only moments of Bliss I get are sometimes with my boyfriend, I get giddy about thinking about our future, or seeing a selfie he sent me while at work and make me swell. Those are occasional, but the only thing I ever feel that's positive to a somewhat major degree. I think my new birth control (first time on it) has made my depression worse. I don't believe in antidepressants for myself. I've been stressed out so much I've lost a bunch of weight too.  Now that I've vented, I just don't want to feel alone. I want this to go away. I want to be excited to see my boyfriend at the end of the day, and excited for the day I may marry him. I want to have a hobby I am passionate about. I want to go to work and be happy and thankful I have a job that I do. I want to feel love for my mom and dad.   Is anyone else like me out there? Does it ever get better?

" Im Tessa. Im 16 years old. My little boy Ian is now 11 1/2 months. Everyday I look at him and am just amazed by how big he's getting. my life has changed so much since I had him. I mean who could believe that just over 2 years ago I was on my way to being in the ""popular crowd"". I was Miss Suzy High School. I hated it and I hated me. Prentending that I loved cheer. Don't get me wrong cheer is great just not for me. I don't have the patcience or the determination to give up that much time to one lousy sport.   I hated pretending that I loved hanging out with my boyfriend. I gave up all my friends for him. I loved him but I definitly missed my friends. Critter was so controlling. Always telling me who, what, where, and when. He let all his friends just walk all over me.    But that's changed. I got pregnant at the young age of 14. Critter didn't want to believe it. I was making it up supposedly to get him not to break up with me. Ya right! I loved him but I'm not that pathetic. I was too scared to tell my parents. So I waited until I was 5 1/2 months along. Too far along to keep hiding it. I don't think I've ever seen my parents so mad. They were convinced that I couldn't handle a baby so I'd give him up to my parents. My mom can't have any more children and she's always wanted another. But i knew differant, I knew i could handle a baby. I fought over every little thing with them. I was so stupid about the true rights for teen parents. I believe my parents when they said that I had to do with that baby what they wanted me to. So I let them talk me into giving Ian my stepdad's last name. Ian Matthew Kubitza. Everyday since they talked me into it I've regreted it more than you can imagine.    One thing that I was right about was that I could handle a baby. I'm the one who deals with temper tantrums, dirty diapers and late nights.  Don't get me wrong, without my mom I never could have made it this far. My mom watches Ian when I go to school and when I work. I still go to school full time and I'm going to start nursing next year through a program in my HS. I can't wait. I also have a part time job now. Granted it isn't the best but hey it's something!    My life is definitly better. I don't hate myself or my group any more. I do the things in school that I want not what looks cool.

" Today was Teddy Bear day at Alexander's daycare. All of the kids in his class were supposed to bring Teddy Bears, yesterday they made Teddy Bear books out of construction paper - you get the picture. Alexander does not like to get boxed in to conventional thinking so he interpreted it as ""pet"" day. This opened up his entire stuffed animal collection to be taken to school. Alexander chose his Big Bird to take to school, but it is no ordinary, stuffed, Big Bird. Oh no. This one was given to him as paybacks for some annoying toy that my wife or I gave to someone else's child. This Big Bird has a whole bunch of games that you can choose by squeezing his toes. He also has a backpack full of blocks that have letters, numbers, and shapes. You put a block into his hand and talks about it, depending on which game you picked. Sounds good on paper, right? The catch is that some deviant toy maker endowed this Big Bird with the most annoying, nasal voice - and it has no off switch. That's right. Once you awaken the bird, it starts talking, trying to get the child to play, it waits a few seconds, and then tries again, and again, and again.... Remember how I said that there is no off switch? Yeah. I imagine that the designers of this toy are in a witness protection program somewhere. Think about how this toy got made - in some corporate meeting room, an assortment of marketing, technical, sales, and other people got together - probably many times, reviewed this design, and decided that it was a good idea. Anyway, this is what Alexander took to school. I thought that I had hidden it better than that, but I was mistaken. Anyway, when I took him into his room, his teacher thought that The Bird was cute - and then he awakened it. I chose that moment to beat feet out of there. In the evening when I returned to pick up Alexander, his bird was not in his cubby with his blanket and other things. It was on top of the cabinets as far out of reach as the teachers could make it.

In my mind I was hopeful that we could maintain this relationship despite the obvious obstacles. I told her I cared about her more than anyone I have ever dated and said that I wish we had a chance together. She told me she doesn't believe in long distance relationships, this kind of broke my heart but at the same time I knew it was the logical choice in this situation. She told me that she did not want to cut me out of her life and that she wanted to stay in contact with me. She also said that if it was meant to be that it will happen for us. My family has been very hesitant about our relationship because they worry about me spiraling downward when she leaves. I am a little worried about myself as well, today I cried on the way to school and during my break between classes. She leaves in 6 days and she still wants to see me as much as possible before she leaves. I am so afraid to lose her and scared of how I will feel when she is gone.

"I think I'm having a nervous breakdown I've struggled off and on for about 10 years with anxiety and depression. The latter half has been mostly on. Recently my psychiatrist changed my medication from Zoloft to Effexor because the Zoloft had pretty much plateaued and then started working less. I don't think the Effexor is having a very good effect on me. My depression has been worse than ever. On top of that I found out that my dog has bone cancer and likely won't live more than 8-12 months. She's only 6 and she has been my entire world since I adopted her and she has helped me through a lot of difficult times. Because of these things my moods have been very bad, and I had to leave work a few days ago and I haven't been back since, and I'm pretty sure they're going to fire me because I'm still new. Although the job was adding to my stress because they failed to tell me that we would be working mandatory overtime EVERY SINGLE DAY. I don't have much of a support system. My mom is pissed at me about work, and I'm living with my grandfather who just doesn't get it. I don't really have much in the way of friends which is I guess why I'm ranting on Reddit looking for some kind of support. I don't really know what to do. I'm going to call my psychiatrist Monday to set up an appointment and hopefully get off Effexor. I want to find a job that is less intense than this one, and less hours. Hopefully part time.

"I could really use some reassurance that my life is worth living. I took a chance last year and despite depression I reached for a goal, which was me taking my first full-time job in the field I went to college for. This was supposed to be my big redeeming moment, the big change in my life. But it's been a few months at my job now, and things aren't going super well. I'm facing the very real possibility of total failure.

"I’ve completed step one I’m killing myself this year. Not sure when, but I’m really hoping I can make it happen. Last week, I had a wild night in the shower with a lot of vodka and a razor, posted one last snap on my story with a waving emoji, then went full white noise. No snapchat, no instagram, no Facebook, nothing. Broke all my streaks. Now I have no contact with anyone at all. I avoid the people I know at meal times. I stay in my room  and game, or start the long list of letters I have to write to people. The sad thing is, I could have been dead almost a week and no one would know. No one has come to my room to check on me, or message me to ask if I’m ok. No ones seen or heard from me in days. I’ve pushed everyone away. Step 1 is complete.

"I can absolutely relate to what you're going through. I understand how difficult it is adjusting to so many different personalities. Ten people in one apartment is overwhelming, to say the least. I used to live with four other girls who had diverse interests, and unfortunately we all kept to ourselves because of the different personalities. It was best that way. In your case, it seems like you're making as much effort as you can to be social. There's no need to go out on a limb to prove that you're not anti-social. When I had depression I really needed my space and the last thing I wanted to do was socialize with my roommates. Luckily, I am in my own apartment and have been living alone for three years now. It has helped enormously. I wonder if you can request a transfer to a bachelor suite where you can live by yourself. I did that in my 3rd year and the apartment manager put me on a waiting list, and I was able to get my own living space by November. Even though the moving was a hassle, I never regretted it. As for finding ways to spend time away from the noise of other people, I usually take the bus to visit a bookstore that is far away from campus. I go there every weekend to relax and read. It's away from campus life and it has helped me sort out my thoughts. The suggestions made by others such as the library, and a park are wonderful too. Maybe you can purchase a bus pass? I have depression and social anxiety, so it was difficult dealing with the university atmosphere on my own. I made only a couple of friends who have since moved on or graduated. I too saw a school counselor, but it was short-lived. What helped me, other than getting away from campus, was getting some online support from forums such as this one. I also kind of clung to one friend at a time, instead of many groups of people. I'd go to the movie theatre and watch something funny, or I'd take long walks. You're not alone. Hang in there and keep posting if you feel really down. I think this forum is very supportive and people will try to help you the best way they can.",1,absolutely relate going through understand difficult adjusting different personality people apartment overwhelming say least used live girl diverse interest unfortunately kept different personality best way case like making effort social need limb prove not antisocial depression really needed space thing wanted socialize roommate luckily apartment living year now helped enormously wonder request transfer bachelor suite live yourself did rd year apartment manager waiting list able living space november moving hassle regretted it finding way spend time away noise people usually bus visit bookstore far away campus weekend relax read away campus life helped sort thought suggestion library park wonderful too maybe purchase bus pas depression social anxiety difficult dealing university atmosphere own couple friend moved graduated saw school counselor shortlived helped me getting away campus getting online support forum one kind clung friend time instead group people movie theatre watch funny long walk not alone hang posting feel really down think forum supportive people try help best way can
" So there's this life I'm living, and only some know about parts of it, and I can't really write yet about any of it. Every time I find somewhere I think I'm comfortable writing, someone steps in and takes that feeling away, swiftly and murderously. I like to write, it's obvious, I've been doing it for years, but I like to write what I want, about whatever I want, and it's hard to do so while striving for anynomity. I hate having to hide behind a mask of unrecognizable features, just to tell the story of my life. The true story of my life, no frills, no strings attached, the real deal. But there some who who'd most definitely not approve, and though I can't blame her for getting upset at the things I do and think about, I can't help it, it's just how I am. It's the life I live, and I'm still not being very specific. Do you know, that if she were to read this, she'd hound me until the year's end asking what I'm talking about, what things in my life I do but can't write about, what would upset her, blah blah, and we all know how that goes, surely. So instead, I find another spot, and take my time trying to find comfort in that spot, with intent to eventually just write everything. I tire of taking out a pen and notebook, jotting everything down, while knowing I'm the only one who gets to read it. I'm a bit conceited, self-centered maybe, when I say I want others to hear my story, too. That's what these sites are all about, though, writing as a sort of entertainment towards others. That's just what we all like to do.  So with that all said, give me a few more entries where no one specifically is asking me anything, and I'll start writing about the real thing. Until then, please bare with my rambling.

"Fight! Fight! Fight! Hey Reddit community, I need to know if I’m in the wrong in a certain situation...  So a friend and I, lets just call him Kevin, have been good friends for years and have always gotten along (for the most part) pretty well. Earlier this week, though, he was poking fun at me about a certain rumor he had heard about me from a mutual friend of both of ours. The rumor was completely false and out of left field, so much out of left field, that I confronted the mutual friend and asked them what the fuck they were doing. Now, this mutual friend had told my friend Kevin about this rumor and they laughed about it and he made fun of me for it in a pretty brutal, but still jokingly, manner, but decided to drag me in front of the whole squad about it before he asked me whether it was actually true or not. It still bugged me, though, that this mutual friend was talkin shit to who knows who else, spreading this false rumor and whatnot, so I decided to control this mutual friend about the rumor. The mutual friend was surprised that I confronted them about it, and complained to Kevin and thought that it was “weird” that I would confront someone who was spreading false shit about me. Now apparently this mutual friend cut ties with me (I think it’s funny and I wasn’t good enough friends with them to actually care), but Kevin is extremely angry at me and we haven’t talked to each other or about it since, making me think that things will naturally go south. I admit I may have overreacted although I don’t think I’m in the wrong, so I refuse to apologize. Any advice, Reddit community? If I believe that I truly wasn’t in the wrong, should I really apologize for how I handled this?",0,fight fight fight hey reddit community need know wrong certain situation friend i let just kevin good friend year gotten for part pretty well earlier week though poking fun certain rumor heard mutual friend ours rumor completely false left field left field confronted mutual friend asked fuck doing now mutual friend told friend kevin rumor laughed fun pretty brutal jokingly manner decided drag squad asked actually true not bugged me though mutual friend talkin shit know else spreading false rumor whatnot decided control mutual friend rumor mutual friend surprised confronted it complained kevin thought weird confront spreading false shit me apparently mutual friend cut tie i think funny not good friend actually care kevin extremely angry not talked since making think thing naturally south admit overreacted not think wrong refuse apologize advice reddit community believe truly not wrong really apologize handled this
"help with friends/roommate situation I have been trying to be friends with my roommate for months, but recently noticed she uses me. I always invite her to hang out, I do all the cleaning, I bake her food, do sweet things, helped her when shes throwing up, taken care of her, and overall have been called an amazing roommate by others. She's never once said thank you or has reciprocated, and my mother and a friend called it into my attention. I was fine with it (sort of), but I really wish she would have maybe wanted to be friends. But like I said, its fine you can't force people to care back. My problem arose when I introduced her to my bestest friends because she was sad and lonely and heading down a road I was very familiar with and didn't want her to go through, and she proceeded to ""Steal"" my bestest friends. I only say the world steal because she doesn't try to be friends with me and talks behind my back with them and has thoroughly excluded me from my own friend group. I'm just so angry and can't talk to her, she has permanently damaged my friendships because she literally always hangs out with them now, and has just kind of shoved me to a curb. I find it extremely inconsiderate because this year has been really rough for me because I was lowkey depressed for medical reasons and a tough break up, and she knew I was lonely and super super happy when I made my supposed close friends. She is so fake with them, it doesn't make sense. For example, one of my friends was going through a rough time and I was helping him get through it, and my roommate tried to butt in and help him too after meeting him like once. Yes, reader you are probably thinking to yourself, what's wrong with wanting to help people? And I would agree with you, there isn't anything wrong. But the thing is that she lacks consistency. She only tries to help when it is beneficial to her. Helping people is not in her personality, I spent months and months sobbing and upset and she would just run away and turn a blind eye. Why care about my friend who I had taken the time to bond with and gained trust with? She literally had met him like twice?! I think I forgot to mention that we are both female and all my friends are male and she didn't have any male friends before this and she was upset and lonely because of an ex...sounds sketchy af to me.... Point is, I haven't talked to her in two weeks, I just can't hang with my friends anymore, and everyone thinks I'm the bad guy. I myself don't know if I am the bad guy, my close friends from home think I have a right to be upset..am I the bad guy for being upset? What should I even do at this point?  Some people told me I needed to find better friends since they don't take my feelings into consideration, but I don't want to be that bitch that is like you have to choose friends...I'm conflicted with that because loyalty in friendship is very important..idk please help I'm just so sad and mad ",0,help friendsroommate situation trying friend roommate month recently noticed us me invite hang out cleaning bake food sweet thing helped shes throwing up taken care her overall called amazing roommate others said thank reciprocated mother friend called attention fine sort of really wish maybe wanted friend like said fine force people care back problem arose introduced bestest friend sad lonely heading road familiar did not want through proceeded steal bestest friend say world steal doe not try friend talk thoroughly excluded friend group just angry talk her permanently damaged friendship literally hang now just kind shoved curb extremely inconsiderate year really rough lowkey depressed medical reason tough break up knew lonely super super happy supposed close friend fake them doe not make sense example friend going rough time helping it roommate tried butt help meeting like once yes reader probably thinking yourself wrong wanting help people agree you not wrong thing lack consistency try help beneficial her helping people not personality spent month month sobbing upset just run away turn blind eye care friend taken time bond gained trust with literally met like twice think forgot mention female friend male did not male friend upset lonely exsounds sketchy af me point is not talked week just hang friend anymore think bad guy not know bad guy close friend home think right upsetam bad guy upset point people told needed better friend not feeling consideration not want bitch like choose friendsi conflicted loyalty friendship importantidk help just sad mad

"Am I Depressed or is it something else? This seems like a dumb question because to an extent I know I'm depressed but not to a clinical level. Like I hate the situation I'm in. I hate being in debt. I hate living where I live. That sort of thing.   However, I'm not unmotivated. Like at all. I'm not hopeless. I'm not suicidal in any way. I'm terrified of death in fact one of my biggest fears is that I'll get so depressed that I'll become suicidal which is weird, I know but the point is, nothing in me wants to die.   That being said, I'm tired all the time. I mean physically exhausted. Which seems to contradict major depression. I get up every day, shower every day, though I don't really want to go to work I go to work and do work with no issue (it's more that I don't enjoy my job that much on most days honestly some days it's super fun it's just one of those things it really has to do with the fact that I'm older and I'm not doing what I thought I'd be doing by this point in my life more than I hate my job).   I can't think of many reasons why I'd be this physically exhausted all the time. Literally every doctor says ""You you are just massively depressed"". No, I don't believe I'm depressed to the degree that it makes me physically exhausted. If I still have plenty of hope for the future, want to get up, want to get dressed, want to shower, want to look good...how is this major depression to a point where I'm also tired all the time? Is it possible to have some major depressive disorder and not be hopeless and still be motivated to work hard and try new things? Because if it is, someone needs to tell me that. Any time a doctor tells me I must be depressed if I'm so tired all the time and I tell them that I'm not hopeless or suicidal or unmotivated then they go, ""Oh well I don't know what it is then"".   I'm very annoyed with this because I never used to be physically exhausted like this before and doctors seem to just dismiss it as depression when I'm positive my depression isn't so bad it's ONLY making my physically exhausted and not having any other emotional affect on me. I'm frustrated so, if anyone can answer this it'd be helpful so I can see what avenue to pursue next.

"I miss my best friend and they miss me I'm 12 and my best friend is 11. We both have the same birthday and were best friends last year. So this year I chose to homeschool for something. And during this year I've barely seen my best friend. I would ask my mom a lot to setup some weekly hang-out with him but it never got to happen.During this time we've found a soccer team to play on together. One practice, we got to talk after. During this chat he mentioned him always asking his mom to let me come to his house. I stated I did the same thing. That night it made me glad he wanted to hang out with me all the time. About 5 days later I realized what this chat meant. Really when he stated that he asked his mom about me coming over a lot, he was practically saying he missed me. And when I stated the same thing back I was saying the same thing. I learned it was a test of friendship from him, and that we were both thinking the same thing, missing eachother a lot. Right now, we're both just waiting for a weekly hang-out to happen. During this wait, we're both sad; what's the best thing for me to do when we're waiting? Should I try and talk to him more?

"I want to fix my best friend and I's friendship, but I'm not sure if I should... any advice? Hi! I'll try to make this as short as possible, but you can ask me for more details if you want to. My best friend (19/f) and I (19/f) met two years ago. We're polar opposites, but we somehow became very close, and eventually started calling each other best friends (and other nicknames haha). It was awesome, and she's the only person I feel that close with -- she's like family (though I never told her that).  Back in July though, I was feeling very drained. My best friend deals with severe depression and I was helping her a lot through it, willingly so. Honestly I felt fine for a year but I've been going through a huge identity crisis, trying to find myself and trying to know myself. I felt so confused and lost with myself -- I didn't know what I wanted anymore. It was bad. It was very exhausting for me mentally but I thought the cause of how I felt was my best friend. You might ask why I thought that, well, whenever we'd hang out, I'd have to go out of my house. I'm an introvert, and I deal with a lot of anxiety, I always feel uncomfortable being outside. But considering I'd only go outside to hang out with my best friend, I thought *she* was the problem. I took me a while but I eventually decided, even though I didn't really want to, to end the friendship. I thought this would make me feel better, like it was the key to my happiness or something.  After I overcame the ugly crying phase that lasted for a week after I ended the friendship, I was feeling really good... for only a week. It was a sense of freedom like ""I don't have to worry about anything anymore!!"". I started missing her real bad though. But I thought, hey, maybe I just miss the IDEA of her, and not really HER. So I waited to see if my feelings would change over time.   Back in september, uni started. We shared the same classes. We saw each other again and I thought it was a good opportunity to talk to her again and explain some things out, and especially apologize to her (we had a bad argument when I told her I was ending the friendship), and she apologized too. She was really excited because some of her guy friends were with her at uni and she wanted me to hang out with them. I was still questioning a lot of things about myself at this point, and I was terribly anxious about starting uni, and also because I was scared her friends wouldn't like me or think I'm too ""innocent"" or whatever. So I chickened out and decided to avoid her. Two days later, I dropped out of uni (not because of her), and didn't say a word. I was feeling ashamed about dropping out and I had issues at home that made me feel really depressed, so I isolated myself BAD. I pushed all of my friends away, and eventually ended up alone, well, I still had some internet friends, but they didn't last long because I ended up ignoring everyone's messages.   Fast forward to now. I still miss my best friend terribly. Some days are worse than others. I thought I'd be over it by now but I always end up crying at night because I just want to talk to her and hang out like we used to. I tried to distract myself as much as I could, and I tried to make new friends, but every time, I ended up realizing that I was just trying to find someone to replace her, which obviously didn't work out. I realized that I talk about her everyday still to my parents. My mom actually asked me how she was doing and I had to remind her that we're no longer best friends. I still think very fondly of my best friend so when I talk about her, or think about her, it's like nothing happened. I dream about her too sometimes.  I want to contact her again. I want to explain to her everything I was feeling and tell her I want us to be friends again. But I'm scared. It looks like she's completely moved on from me, and she has this new (guy) friend and they seem really close. It makes me sad because I feel like I've been replaced and I won't be able to be her best friend again. I want to be here for her, laugh with her, cry with her, hang out with her, be by her side during the best and worst moments. I don't want to be with anyone else. Just her. I can't blame her for finding new friends and moving on, also her new friend seems like a really great guy, I actually think I'd get along with him. But I don't know, it still makes me feel sad. It makes me feel like I shouldn't contact her because she doesn't need me in her life anymore and she forgot about me. I'm aware this is probably the case though.  I've been thinking of making an audio where I just talk about what's on my mind and talk about our friendship and send it to her. I'm so scared though. Is this a good idea or should I just drop it? It really makes me feel sad and I'm crying way too much over this -- I feel like, even if we can't be friends again, I need some closure. I didn't tell her everything when I ended the friendship, I only told her something like ""we don't click anymore"", I'm not even sure because it was a lie. I didn't want to hurt her feelings by saying her depression was hard for me to deal with because I also had my issues. I don't know. Sorry I'm kind of a mess haha, I hope you can still understand what I'm saying.  Also -- if you think I should do the audio thing -- do you have any advice on what to say and what not to say? I'd really appreciate it.  **TL;DR: I ended our friendship of two years because I was going through an identity crisis and she was dealing with severe depression and it made me feel terribly drained. I regret it though and I've been missing her so much but I don't know how to contact her again as she's got a new close friend and seems to have moved on. I've been thinking about making an audio for her where I talk about our friendship and what's on my mind but I'm not sure if this is a good idea. Should I just drop it or still give it a shot? I deeply miss her and I can't seem to get over her no matter how hard I try to. Also -- if you think I should do the audio thing -- do you have any advice on what to say and what not to say?

"[Need Advice] Need anti depressants but I don't want my mum to know about it. Hello guys, I am 17 and I live in Singapore with my Mum. I have been depressed on and off for the past 5 years with serious suicidal thoughts for the last 4.   I really think that it's time that I start anti depressants because I reckon it would help me tons. The problem is, I don't want my mum to know because the last time I opened up about being slightly suicidal and very depressed, she freaked out on me (don't need to get into details.) She has had a history with it herself and I know that if i ever took my life, it would permanently ruin her.   At this point, medication is my last resort. I've had a girlfriend and it made no difference whatsoever, I still feel empty most of the time and would rather die than anything else.  I know that in Singapore you're able to consent medically when you're 16, but I'm not sure if i can possible get around her for meds like this without her knowledge/consent. Any help for my situation would be fantastic :) Thanks everyone",1,need advice need anti depressant not want mum know it hello guy live singapore mum depressed past year suicidal thought really think time start anti depressant reckon help ton problem is not want mum know time opened slightly suicidal depressed freaked do not need detail history know took life permanently ruin her point medication resort girlfriend difference whatsoever feel time die else know singapore able consent medically not sure possible med like knowledgeconsent help situation fantastic thanks
"My best is not enough. Ok, so here is the situation: I broke up with my ex five months ago. As soon as we ended our thing, I started running everyday, eating healthy food only, and going to the gym. 1h30min of HEAVY exercise everyday. I did this until this very day. I lost fucking 15kg (my weight at the start was 90kg, now 75kg). I also bought green contact lenses to wear, and even sunbathe. I invested so much time (and money) to improve myself and look amazing and no. one. noticed.! I look at the mirror and I am happy with my results. Then, the moment I exit my house:BOOM. 4 months thrown into the trash. No one cares. It makes no difference.  The women I'm attracted still do not find me attractive. It pisses me off how I imagine they won't survive just one week of my training. They can't see how hard I worked to change. I downloaded Tinder,even saw my EX there, wrote a BIO describing myself (I still find myself interesting. People, don't) and I got nearly 0 matches. Now I'm stuck in an Alcohol /Cigarette/Party/OneNightStandGirls loop and I can't get out of it. I drink so much that I can't even remember some things. I have fun, yes. But I want to have a connection with someone again. Is it asking too much? Why people don't give a chance to know me???

"Escapism and depression Sorry about the self-pity rant that's inbound, needed to get this out there somehow.  This morning I was taking a shower sitting down with the lights off - I know, pretty edgy behavior, but it's my way of unwinding and resetting myself between bouts of work.   I finished up a relatively escapist story the night prior. Stupidly, I had allowed myself to suspend my disbelief and got sucked into the plot. The writing wasn't even terribly good - the only reason I enjoyed myself was because I could temporarily forget my current self and take up the role of some other more relevant and admirable character.   The story ended with a shoehorned but unbearably happy ending where the main character gets married, settles in with his newfound friends, and all's good for the time being. You know, the typical ""insert generic ending here"" bullshit.   Fast forward to this morning. I'm in the shower and start thinking of my day to come, making mental to-do lists, and stressing about my current temporary problems. But somewhere along the line, I start thinking of the stupid story. I can't help but start comparing my  life with that of the main character and think about how much I'd give just to be able to live a more meaningful, less real life. Then I start comparing myself to the character, and realize just how _useless_ I am. Like holy shit, I'm almost an adult and am still a passionless idiot who does nothing outside of schoolwork. Of course I can't lead a meaningful life, I'm not worthy of any of it. Thinking about this evidently stressed me out a bit too much, as I started puking what little I ate all over my shower floor and crying.   I don't know. I enjoy escapism probably to a fault, but it's the only way for me to feel at least a little relevant. I'll probably come to terms with my role as human being #6,732,385,402 someday.

"I've had quite a few life situations that have probably contributed to depression.1. I grew up in an emotionally/sexually abusive family...but the type of abuse that is just over the line enough to mess with your head, to make you wonder if it was really abusive or if you were just sensitive. I still talk to them and see them at times, but vast quantities of things go unsaid. 2. I left home for college, and almost immediately was recruited into a religious cult where I stayed for 14 or so years; I just got out a couple of years ago. 3. I had my first major depressive episode while inside and although I found a supportive therapist, she too was in the cult and therefore some of her advice at times was influenced by their beliefs. Also I was alternately shunned and ostracized, rebuked harshly, or encouraged to give up medicines/therapy by various members in various levels of leadership in the cult. 4. I very recently switched jobs to a much better job situation, but am still adjusting the environment. 5. We're in contract to purchase a home, which is great, but also an adjustment. The Question. My psychiatrist thinks I've been depressed for most of my life. Which makes sense when I look back over my journals and look at various things I did, said or experience. Thing is, to me, depression as a state of mind became normal. I didn't know anything different than how I was feeling. So what happens is this: I mention something I've been experiencing to my therapist. She is concerned and asks if I've brought it up to my psychiatrist. When I do bring it up to my psychiatrist, he says, ""Why didn't you mention this before?"" To which my response is: I didn't know I should. Translation: I thought it was normal. Right now I'm on Effexor, with Adderall XR as a booster plus synthroid due to a nasty run in with lithium. When I started I was okay. Great even, minus the utter exhaustion at the end of every day. Lately though I've been feeling...things...that I can't describe. Sadness...but a feeling bigger and diverse than the word ""sadness"" can contain. Tired...but a ""tired"" with an emotional component. Feelings I don't have words for, but that pierce me to the bone. And that are not connected with anything in real time that I can think of. Is this normal? Deep strong feelings that surface out of nowhere for a time and then dissipate...usually on the weekends when I don't have work to focus on? Not feeling much of anything in between those times? Being vibrant and full of ideas yet calm and productive first thing after I take the medicines, but gradually fading to sort of numb, definitely tired, somewhat negative by the afternoon with exhausted, sink into the couch with the remote, hit the bed for a nap by 7:30, sometimes 6pm? How do you know what's ""normal"" if abnormal has been normal for you for so long? How do you know when it's time to have a sit down with the psychiatrist again?",1,quite life situation probably contributed depression grew emotionallysexually abusive familybut type abuse just line mess head make wonder really abusive just sensitive talk time vast quantity thing unsaid left home college immediately recruited religious cult stayed year just got couple year ago major depressive episode inside supportive therapist cult advice time influenced belief alternately shunned ostracized rebuked harshly encouraged medicinestherapy various member various level leadership cult recently switched job better job situation adjusting environment contract purchase home great adjustment question psychiatrist think depressed life make sense look journal look various thing did said experience thing is me depression state mind normal did not know different feeling happens this mention experiencing therapist concerned asks brought psychiatrist bring psychiatrist say why did not mention before response is did not know should translation thought normal right effexor adderall xr booster plus synthroid nasty run lithium started okay great even minus utter exhaustion end day lately feelingthingsthat describe sadnessbut feeling bigger diverse word sadness contain tiredbut tired emotional component feeling not word for pierce bone not connected real time think of normal deep strong feeling surface time dissipateusually weekend not work focus on not feeling time vibrant idea calm productive thing medicine gradually fading sort numb definitely tired somewhat negative afternoon exhausted sink couch remote hit bed nap pm know normal abnormal normal long know time sit psychiatrist again

"Fuck Everything &amp; Everyone I decided to make a different account for this, because I need to get all of this off my chest. I hate myself and I hate my life. I feel trapped at an absolute dead end in my life, and I'm not even in my twenties yet. I might as well be, considering everything I have to do.  I turned 17 a few months ago, and things have only gotten worse. My parents are completely delusional and can't grasp the fact that thet cause suffering for their own benefit. They would punch you in the face and find any excuse in the book to give a reason behind what they did, even if there wasn't one.  My mom is an asshole, to put it nicely. She's very controlling. I've called and made my own therapy appointments only to find out she cancelled them, resulting in me having to find a different therapist AND doctor twice because they wouldn't take me because of canceling so many times, and I still haven't found either, so no therapy or medication. I have next to no friends because of how she is, coupled with my inability to speak without getting anxiety.   My dad is a lazy dirtbag who fights with me constantly for no reason other than he hates me. He hates how liberal I am, he hates the people I like, whatever I like he probably hates. He sits in front of a TV all day watching shit, he bitches about anything he can, yet does absolutely nothing to fix the issue that he's the main cause of. No clean dishes? I'm in the wrong even though he doesn't rinse his or even bring them to the sink. Pills went missing? He takes more than he's supposed to and forgets and goes into a rage. So on and so forth.  I honestly don't look forward to waking up anymore. I can only find peace at night and then I usually get less sleep than I should. Of course I'm 'lazy' for sleeping in. More gets done quicker in less time when I get up than the whole time they've been up.  I hate this stupid town and I hate my life. It feels like I'm destined for absolute failure. School puts a heavy amount of pressure on me too. I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up, that would be ideal honestly.  The list of things that make me happy and want to live grows shorter every day, and I'm so, so lost on what to do anymore. I feel so uncomfortable and just... wrong.

"I have a gripe about pharmaceutical and insurance companies.  You can take up to 450 mg / day of Wellbutrin XL.  The manufacturer makes 150 mg and 300 mg pills, but not a 450 mg pill.  OK, so just take 3 of the 150's, right?  Well if the doctor prescribes it that way, at least one insurance company won't pay for it.  The doctor has to prescribe it as one 300 mg pill plus one 150 mg pill - thereby making the patient have to pay 2 co - payments for what should be one prescription.   Why doesn't the manufacturer make a 450 mg pill?  And how can the insurance companies get away with forcing doctors to prescribe in what is really a stupid manner?

"I'm 46 and have been depressed since I was maybe 5 years old. I was emotionally abused by two confused parents. Depression & alcoholism runs rampantly in my family - fortunately I escaped the alcoholism. I was diagnosed as having major depression when I was about 25 and I've been on medication since then. I've also had intensive psychotherapy and done lots of research on the subject. Nothing erases the stigma!! ""Depression"" is misnamed. It should be called serotonin-deficiency disorder or something long and fancy so people will respect it. Too many say, ""Depression? Snap out of it!"" Or ""Do something to cheer yourself up."" What bunk. It affects every part of your body. Last year I realized that some of my depression was caused by kidney failure. I escaped dialysis and will probably be OK. But what a relief to have something ""serious"" to blame my problems on! Everybody respects kidney failure as a ""real disease"". I had to disown my brother last year because his reaction to my failing health was to call me a loser and an embarrassment. Very typical reaction from him, although the rest of my family were supportive. I now have no brother. I should have done it a long time ago. It takes such a long time to come to a point where you believe you deserve something good in life. I'm intelligent, employed and don't do drugs or alcohol, never have, but sometimes I feel like a bum, a worthless waste of space, not worth the effort. I have to argue myself out of that mindset every day, and it's so exhausting, and people wonder why I'm tired all the time and have no energy. I'm very angry, too. I have never had a successful relationship and don't believe I ever can. I don't even believe it exists. No kids, either, but maybe that's a good thing. They take a lot of emotional energy. Anyway, I hate to sound like a whiner, but sometimes you have got to whine!! And I'm happy to listen to everybody else and give them my support.

" I awoke this morning in a foul mood.  Why??  I don't really know.  I had become a little testy on the phone with my girlfriend last night but not enough to justify it carrying over to the next day.  One thing I do know is it is setting the precedence for the rest of the day, which isn't really surprising as once I get in a foul mood it is extremely hard to pull myself up out of the trenches of self loathing and hatred.  I've been at work for the last 4 hours and have thus far accomplished nothing, at least a lot more nothing then what I usually accomplish while at work.  In recent times I have slipped from a model employee to the try to do as little as possible disgruntle employee, reason being my boss recently hired a new employee and our office is turning into a good ole boys club where I being of the opposite sex feel out of place.  I work at a university and have worked in the same department for the past four years, my official job title is Computer Support Assistant yet my responsibilities have grown much since I started gainful employment here.  Yet now I’m feeling under appreciated as the new guy is getting paid more than me and is perhaps destined, in the near future, for a pay rise, just to stick the knife in a little deeper.    You could argue that his job title carries more clout then mine as he is officially known as a Web Developer, yet I as a lowly old Computer Support Assistant should technically be paid less, yet it appears that I have moved from the illustrious realm of shit kicker to web developer over the years, yet I still kick the shit when ever someone is in.  Technically we should be on an equal playing field, yet this too doesn’t seem to be the case.

"I moved 2,000 miles away for college six years ago. Parents have never visited I'm unsure how to feel.  I moved to the other side of the country (USA) six years ago because I was accepted to a wonderful school in California.  My parents aren't too wealthy but are firmly middle class.  I could not afford to trac back home because I was barely living paycheck to paycheck until recently.  I paid for everything myself - textbooks, housing, transportation.  Of course, they helped out a bit as holiday gifts, but I've never received a care package or any extra aid.    I am graduating next month and feel a bit sad that my parents aren't even sure they want to come for my graduation or party (that I'm paying for myself!).  My mom said she's busy with work and has to coordinate a lot.  She always says ""maybe next summer we'll make a trip out there!""  I'm the first person in my family to graduate college and it's kinda sad that nobody in my family cares to recognize how hard it was to do this on my own.    I last called my dad in mid-December for his birthday.  I wanted to see how long it would take him to actually call me.  It's been three months and I've not heard a word from him.    I was thinking about going back home this summer for a month, but am starting to question whether I should or not.  I love my life here and wish they cared enough to see it.  They have no clue what I do for work, what my degree is in, or where exactly I live.  It's been six years!  My mom just bought a house so I know she's at least had some money for a $300 plane ticket.    What should I do?  Visit this summer and pretend everything is fine?  Wait it out and see how long it takes one of them to call me?  Should I beg them to come to my graduation/party (I've already asked several times). I feel so awkward making up excuses for them all the time (my friends often ask when my family is coming to visit).   Thanks!

"My sister wants to have an intervention with our parents about their marriage. So my sister and I are both adults. I'm 29 and she is 26. Neither of us live at home anymore. I have my ~~only~~ own little nuclear family now and she is renovating a house with her long time boyfriend. Since we have been adults we have noticed that our parents marriage isn't exactly happy. Our parents are basically polar opposites. Dad is a really outgoing people person who likes to have lots of activities and friends. However, he is very very emotional and can blow up at the slightest hint of ""disrespect."" If something is wrong it is never his fault, you know the type. Mom is quiet and reserved, not much on physical or verbal affection at all. Her only hobby/activity is through music ministry at our church. My dad joined the church when they got married, but he isn't religious really and only comes on the holidays. Lately my sister has been really distressed by our parents relationship. She is very empathetic and it really upsets her when they fight. So much so, that she does not want to be around them anymore because of it. Today she told me that she thinks we should have some sort of intervention with them about their marriage. My sister and I have discussed before that they probably should really be divorced, but that it will never happen because our mom is Catholic. I think an ""intervention"" would just make it worse because I know my dad will see it as a personal attack. I'm of the ""it's none of my business"" persuasion but I don't want to miss out on family time with my parents and sister. We all get together every couple of weeks at my parents house for dinner and board games, which I love. I don't want to lose that. Any thoughts?

"[Need Advice] best friend (21f) moving in with my dad (dad age) and I (21f) My best friend and I have talked about living together plenty of times. Now it’s really happening because her family is moving out of state and she has nowhere to go. My dad and I live in an apartment together and share expenses (though he pays for most of it). It’s a pretty good situation, but there are anxieties we both have about my friend moving in. She is unemployed and has been for a while. The deal was that she could move in once she got a job (the deal was made like 7 months ago), but she is still jobless and her family is leaving in 3 days. We’re letting her move in, and luckily her mom is willing to help out with her expenses until she gets a job. But here are the worries: • She had a lot of time before this to get a job, what if she takes even more time even after she’s moved in? My dad and I know from experience how difficult getting a job can be, but also expected her to have one by now. The thing is, she’s very picky (even when she can’t afford to be). She won’t just take any job, she’s only applying to places she’d prefer to work at. Which I totally get! But at some point you just gotta do something even if you hate it, it won’t last forever and will even help you get to doing something you don’t hate. She’s repeatedly said that she’s “not the kind of person that can work a job she doesn’t like”. And that is definitely making it take longer for her to find work. But what can ya do? • Another thing is, my dad and I (my dad especially) have had not-so-great experiences with friends/acquaintances moving in. That’s definitely made both of us have some not-so-great feelings about this situation (even if it may end up being really good!). A lot of things can ruin this and it’s hard to know how to avoid those things while still being a friend. It’s a thin thin line. • my dad and I (my dad more than me) are also worried about compatibility. My dad and I get along great and it’s been no problem for us to live together. We have an unspoken agreement on bills, chores, privacy, etc. It just works. How can we keep that agreement while including a whole new person who might not think the same way? For instance, I don’t know much about the way she lives. I know how it’s been with her family, but things are different when you leave home. It’s tough to say how it will be, but my dad is worried that she won’t be the kind of clean, kind, generous person he expects a friend/roomie to be. It’s tough because I agree with him.. • there’s the other matter of an official Roommate Agreement that could be made and signed by the 3 of us. We all think it’s a great idea, but I know how things can still get messy (literally and figuratively) when living with a friend. The problems that can arise are endless and maybe some even unavoidable. All we want is for things to work out well, with the least amount of issues as possible. Communication is key and that’s the goal of this Roommate Agreement. However, there is still that line that we do not want to cross. I want this move-in to be professional as well as friendly. How can my dad and I make the rules clear so that she will take them very seriously without this being like some kind of crazy contract?

" So these two girls published an article in the school newspaper about the cliques in my school. It's a horrible article. Like, get shot in the head and die. In it they listed what cliques exist at my school--The Asians (it's funny they list that as the first one, because thats the 'clique' they belong to) the Brown kids, The Ghetto Group, The Cheerleaders/Jocks/Preps, the Punks, the Goths and the Druggies. Okay, what the hell? There are 3 kids at my school that could be labeled punk. Two of them are actually Punks, and one of them is a good friend of mine. The other one is a girl who used to be punk, but now she's all...not. This entire article is about how we shouldn't be labeling kids because HEY!  That's what causes cliques!  And then they go and categorize every student at the school? Assholes.  And then, they thought it would be nice to teach me about these cliques.  Students feel acceptance and approval when they are with their ""own people"". How does one come to be labeled as a part of one of these cliques? The way one speaks, dresses common interests and tracking levels.   Tracking levels? Okay! I have no idea what that means.    Students who can be categorized in more than one clique are considered ""confused"". For Example, we were listening to two studens in our class talk about a boy who likes to dress more urban but he listens to rock music at the same time. People were making fun of the boy behind his back saying he was ""confused"".  Cry me a fucking river.  The article goes on about stupid shit. Saying that the two most segregated clubs in my school are DECA and the Multicultural Club. Ironically, THEY'RE IN BOTH.  Oh, I don't want to join that club...It's so...Asian  What the hell. People use that as an excuse?  They ended it by saying that the only way to change this is to make a difference...within. Fucking Hippies.  On that note, all i have to say is...    We can dance if we want to, we can leave your friends behind  'Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance  Well they're no friends of mine     Amen.

I really should have eaten a bigger lunch!  Work was so boring!  Me and Adam just sat there the whole time!  There was no one in there watching us and we were so confused half way into the training! We, what we thought was done, didn't know what to do next!  I was walking around with no shoes on in the main office looking for someone to come and help us! LOL!  I finally found someone to help us and we ended up having a ton of lessons to do. They were so stupid.  Poor Adam started nodding off five mintues into his.  Mine wasn't that bad.  I was actually doing my lessons and not falling asleep!  I was trying to learn!  Unfortunately, I have to train AGAIN tomorrow, but Adam isn't going to be there so I am going to be all by myself! :...(      Moving right along!  Haha..

He hasn't really been gone that long and only has a week and a couple days before he comes back home.  I can't wait to see him.  I miss him ALOT!  We made our first HUGE decision together yesterday.  We decided on going to Cameron our first year of college and go  to OU our sophomore year.  That works for me.  I really want to go to OU, but I can wait a year.  OU isn't going anywhere!  Haha!  It would be better that we wait to go to OU and we go to Cameron our first year.  That way we can keep our jobs and continue saving money for our appartment and everything.  I am really excited that we made that decision.  I can plan out the next couple of years of my life now.  I just need to tell my dad and start getting everything I need to get into Cameron next fall.      Well, I don't really feel like typing any more!  I've been typing all day of the computers at work!

"Am I being paranoid? I joined Girl Crew a few months ago. For those who don't know, it's basically an app for women to make friends. A few of us girls met up twice and have a group chat. We're planning to go to a rally tomorrow, and we all expressed our interest in getting a drink afterwards. Two of the girls tagged/mentioned the others in the group in something on FB - places to go for drinks. Both times I was not mentioned, despite saying that I'd like to go. So, am I being paranoid? Or do I have a right to be upset? Rationally, I shouldn't be. We don't know each other that well, so they can't hate me yet. But I don't know. I didn't make the best first impression, so maybe they don't want to be near me at all. I might not even go tomorrow; I might remove myself from the group chat/delete them off FB.

"Help - unplanned pregnancy at 41, wife wants to keep it Hello, I need some real advice.  My wife and I were married in 2011. We dated four years and the day we married was the best day of my life. We immediately became pregnant with our daughter, who is now 5. A couple of years later we welcomed our son (now almost 3).    Brief introduction of us - I'm almost 41 and she almost 37. I work full time and she recently became a stay at home mom.  We are middle class, homeowners living in Seattle, college degrees, financially responsible, socially liberal on most issues, have good friend circle (many with similar aged children), good family support live in area. Both of us raised in healthy and happy traditional nuclear homes. Our traditional marriage is good and based on trust, but I won't lie and say the last 5 years of raising two children hasn't been without its challenges and occasional spat. But we married for life, and at the altar when I said I do forever, I meant it. Overall, we are fortunate and thankful for our lives.  After the birth of our second child, I was done.  I had considered getting a vasectomy (snipped). Many of my dad friends had done it and recommended I do it. My wife was against it, and I wasn't really wanting to do it either for other reasons.  My wife always semi-joked she wanted another kid, and had quipped she felt incomplete and that being a mother is her calling.  She is an excellent, patient mother to our children.  However, I felt it was a phase and she could get her ""baby fix"" with friends newborns.  I did not feel a need to have another child, and was quite against it. I was frank with her on the matter, but because of the differing opinion and emotional confrontation, we avoided discussing it at length.  Fast forward to 2 weeks ago when my wife informs me she missed her period and sure she is pregnant. No visits to the doctor yet to confirm, but we have never had problems conceiving, and I believe she is pregnant.  Our birth control was her counting her monthly cycle, which she is pretty good at.  I always reached for a condom just in case, but she does not like using them and told me it was not needed. Well we slipped one past the goalie.    When she told me, I reacted poorly, saying it would mess up the good thing we had going, I was tired and didn't have the energy, our family was complete already.  Not to mention the fact that it was be financially very difficult (we'd have to buy a larger house and I don't need to tell you what Seattle real estate is like). We are quite squeezed in our little home already. I told her she would have to go back to work. I asked her to terminate the pregnancy. To sum it up, it wasn't the reaction she was hoping to hear.  The next week I bounced between many emotions. Anger, for upsetting our lives, even considering the idea she intentionally got pregnant. Fear, that our stable little family might crumble, that 3 makes an odd man out and the children would suffer. Fear, that she isn't healthy for this, as she is showing some physical ailments/breakdown that shouldn't be ignored and having another child will only fixing those off further. Fear, that I'm suffering physical ailments as well and don't have the energy to go through another round of caring for an infant. Fear, that both her parents and mine are elderly and close to needing care from us, and that they won't be there to be the ""relief valve"" and help with watching the kids when we need it. Anxiousness, that we had just got out of having the kids in diapers and were just starting the ""next phase"" of our children being autonomous and doing activities I could participate in. Guilt, for crushing her dreams and not supporting the idea of a third child when its something she wants very badly.   One day I wrote out an objective list of reasons (many of which are cited above) why having a third child was a bad idea. After a few more days of trying to ignore the issue, we had our blowup.  I presented her my list and she listened, acknowledging they were valid and made sense. She then countered with her belief that this was meant to be, and she could not in good conscious have an abortion. It would stay with her forever and she says she would never get over it, and would forever resent me for pushing the issue.  I told her I might resent the child and her for letting this happen.   I slept on the couch that night, feeling disgust and bitterness.  The next morning there was nothing else to do but discuss it more. I again said I wasn't interested, and she can't force this on me. She again countered with her same argument that it was meant to be, that our ""next phase"" of children would just have to wait a few more years.  I yelled I would be almost 60 years old at this child's high school graduation. I want to play sports with my kids and be active, not the ""old dad"". I said I wouldn't care, not even over the name we would give it. I said I wound't go with her to the doctor appointment.  I told her she was being selfish and not putting what she has now over what she might have. She told me she would start contacting a divorce lawyer if this was how it was going to be.  It's only been a few days since that talk, but I am completely stunned and not myself.  I was a zombie at work, not able to focus on anything. At home I've been short tempered and avoiding everything.  I've cried in my car, cried in the bathroom. Borderline panic attacks.  I'm frantically researching mental health professionals, as I need to talk to someone. I haven't seen a counselor since before we were married.  I can't talk to my family or friends until the doctor visit to confirm the pregnancy.  I feel like an absolute asshole for saying the things I said and my attitude, and I can't take that back. Even if it isn't a viable pregnancy, or she miscarries, I've made my mark and she will always think less of me. I'm scared she regrets even having ever met me.  I absolutely DO NOT want to break up our family, I love my children and family. I am certain a divorce would ruin all of us.    We are at an absolute impasse. She is set in her mind, the only thing that could stop this is the doctor saying she or the baby are not healthy and viable.   I'm beside myself. It's not that I don't love children, I really do. And I know I'll still love the child regardless, it's not the child's fault and they should not be treated unfairly. And she may be right, that it is only raising another baby is temporary and it'll pass and everything will be OK and we will all be happier. But what if it's not? What if this was a bad idea and our quality of life is destroyed? What if I do resent her, or she resents me because of my opinion.

" let the anonymity begin.  i think we all have something we want to talk about, but that we can't quite bring ourselves to reveal to anyone we actually have to see face to face. i have an overwhelming feeling (regardless of its veracity) that no one will quite understand what i'm saying. but if you do, please share any insights you have with me. my views are not extreme or disturbing, just a challenge for me.  let's start with the introductions. i'm a 27-year old single female. this is NOT a solicitation for men to start asking me out. it's simply a fact. i love being single and being able to do whatever i desire with my life. i've recently returned to grad school and changed my career/life path extraordinarly. i've also moved to a new city where i have made some great friends (mostly male, as is the norm for me). i come from a christian household and still cling to my faith despite doubts and challenges. the big challenge currently is sex.  for better or for worse, i have a sex drive. currently, it's driving me mad. but i also have a moral code that keeps me from even entertaining the idea of casual sex. due to my odd combination of faith and life interests (drinking, smoking, crude jokes, liberal hippie crap, independent lifestyle, tolerance, tattoos, piercings, etc.) it is very difficult to find anyone who is compatable with me. and that's the beginning of the trouble...when i do someone who looks good on paper, i cannot get interested (even though i desparately need to release some pent-up sexual energy). i'm not looking for a solution, per se, but i am frustrated and venting. what am i looking for? HOPE.  so if you got it, send it my way. are you a christian man or woman who has found a great sexual and life partner despite not ""appearing"" to be the christian norm? i often consider giving in to a casual encounter, but i honestly don't think i could physically go through with it...and i'd certainly beat myself up afterward. not out of guilt, necessarily, but just cuz i know that's not what makes me happy.  life is good in so many ways, and hopefully through more of the posts i can open up more of who I am to myself (and to anyone who cares to read them). i am a very odd combination. and i like it :) but i think most people find me very confusing (probably think i'm a prude)...and they like it from about 10 feet away. goodnight moon.

"I'm from MD and I too am going through a depression / anxiety moment in my life. I am just always feeling unappreciated like no one really cares about me as a person, unless they need something from me, I am currently overweight, I feel ugly, I have absolutely no motivation in life whatsoever to want to do ANYTHING. If I could sleep all the time I would. My Mother, whom is or was my best friend ,never calls me unless she need money, clothes, etc. My Sister, she never calls unless she need a ride somewhere, my kids are the same way, my Husband on the other hand does not make any moves to want to make love together when we go to bed, years ago he would used to then he stopped because I never did, but we moved past that dumb shit or so I thought, now when I try he will, but he never does anymore, I am not going to make that move all the time, it's all just a game and I can't play it anymore. It's childish and I just don't need that on top of everything else I'm dealing with. I have a problem with dealing with people, like trying to have a conversation with someone sometimes is hard for me, I feel nervous and get all tongue tied when I'm talking to people, it don't happen with everyone I deal with, just some. I have friends, but they never call me, I have to call them, and it's like they ALL do this, is it me? Is it something I'm doing wrong? I just don't know anymore. I feel like I want to take something sometimes, I feel like I want to run away sometimes, I don't feel suicidal at all, so I guess there's hope. Well that's pretty much all about me.

"I'm trying to go back to school after dropping out of college many years back, and I've got this real supportive boyfriend who wants to help me. Problem is, he's got this need for me to go out there and change the world. He keeps saying I need to be better than everyone in my class, and that I need to be hyper - prepared before I even start class. I don't mind boning up on the class material beforehand, but he wants to help me come up with theses and bring those to my undergrad profs for help, and he wants me to read a whole bunch of texts from my chosen field before the semester starts. He also wants me to study anatomy because, as he says ""anatomy doesn't really change"", so I can be the ""go to"" person with whom all my classmates will want to study. I'm really bright and would like to make something out of myself, but he's got such high hopes and he wants me to do way too much way too soon. I don't even know for certain what I want to be at this point - getting back into the liberal arts program just seems like a good start towards deciding and acting. All this pressure from him is making it hard for me to even take the baby steps I need to take to make anything at all happen. When I try to tell him it's too much pressure, we wind up in a shouting argument (actually, I wind up doing most of the shouting - he just has this way of pressing my buttons.) I've spent my whole life as an inactive perfectionist, and all this from him just makes it hard to break free from that. Meanwhile, he's afraid that I'm going to spend my life playing video games (a reasonable fear at the moment.) He keeps saying lately that I need to move out of childhood, but he wants to parent me. rrbleh..  is there some way to just move around him without having all these arguments, and without letting him pressure me?

"I hate it when bad people get rewarded One of the facts that depresses me most about life is when bad people get rewarded and live comfortably, and loved by all.  It's hard for me to stomach.   For example, I saw one of my former bullies enter the store I work at. She was absolutely terrible toward me when we were in high school, such as defacing my sketchbook, purposefully kicking my food away, sending me fake ""love letters"", and more. Anyway, the bully now had two children (I'm having trouble conceiving so that stings), and I think the bully could smell my fear because she headed right to my counter, and began to make a show of how expensive everything was in our store while also ""catching up"" by telling me about how successful she is with her self made interior design business.  When I got home that night, I looked her up on Facebook, and...she does have a much better life than mine. In every way. I feel angry that she seemed to have a great one while I've...struggled.

"Questionable at best So I've been having depression/anxiety problems since middle school, I have suicidal thoughts time to time, but I have no desire to act on them? I don't mean to waste anybody's time, but sometimes it's really odd, I get these thoughts all the time usually after something angers me or upsets me, but later on I just continue with my day. My depression isn't too serious, I've had small attempts, like holding a hand full of pills but never going through with it. My anxiety seems to be more severe than any other problem I have. I'll be at work, just doing whatever and bam, I get anxious out of nowhere. I try breathing exercises to no avail, eventually it goes away..

"Friend is acting distant, not hanging out much, i don't know what to do. *Apologies ahead of time for the novel.*  So i (M 30s) have been friends with my buddy (M 30s) for several years, and there seems to be a repeating pattern with him and i really don't know what to do when this happens.  Instead of a long history, i'll just cite these last few months as an example.  So as i said, we've known each other for quite a while.  He's probably my best friend, although i wouldn't say i'm his (i'm not sure he really has one).  But anyways, prior to the last couple months we were hanging out as we usually do.  If we don't hang out every other day, we'd usually catch up over voice chat while playing video games, etc...  And this is the normal routine for us, we'd talk or hang out at least every other day, if not more often.  Then suddenly, a few weeks ago, it's like a switch went off and he's out.  What i mean by that is since then, i may hear from him once a week for an hour or so, at best; sometimes longer.  When we do chat, he mostly seems normal, but i can tell he's off.  So i've asked him what he's been up to, what's going on in his life, you know the usuals, and i get the usual answers for him: work, playing video games, seeing his parents occasionally.  I've brought up his absence and asked him what's going on, and his answer is usually the standard runaround, ""oh nothing"", ""i've just been avoiding everyone"", ""just doing my own thing"".  I pressed a little harder a couple weeks back and got a jokingly put ""i guess i've got a serotonin imbalance, haha"". I could sense his desire not to talk about it (which he never does, he hates discussing anything feelings related), so i let it go.  Next time we spoke, i brought it up again, asked him how he was doing with his issues, and got the usual ""meh"" or ""i dunno"".  When i asked what i could do to help him, he answered, ""you can stop fucking asking me about it"", so i of course let it go, and our convo continued as if there were no problems.  But of course there are, he's still MIA for weeks at a time.  The thing is, this is a pattern with him.  We're normal buddies, seeing/chatting all the time for months, and then WHAM, he's out and like this for weeks or a few months.  Then as if another switch goes off, he's back on again and acts normal and as if nothing's happened.  This has happened more times than i can count.  You know i wouldn't be so concerned if he were actually busy with life and doing things, but as he tells it in his own words when i do see him, he's doing nothing out of the ordinary (which for him is work and sitting home every night by himself (lives alone) playing video games (something we usually do together).  But as far as i can tell he's just sitting alone by himself every night.    I've considered the possibility he's depressed or bi-polar (although you'd never get him to admit that), in which case i don't know what to do if he won't talk to me about it.  I've considered that perhaps i've done something to make him angry, but when he does come around (if i'm not bringing up this issue), he acts completely normal and we laugh and cut up, and whatnot like nothings wrong.  I've thought perhaps he's just not interested in being friends anymore, but he does still come around, and as i've said, after one of these episodes for a few weeks/months it's as if nothing's happened at all.    So my problem is this.  I don't know what to do when he's like this.  I don't know how to act, what to say, how to approach him, etc.  You know, he's my best friend, i'd like to be there for him, to help if i can, but he rebuffs any attempt on my part to find out what's really going on, well besides him just ""avoiding everyone right now, and doing my own thing"".  He gets agitated if i push the issue.  So how do i handle this?  Is there a way to broach this topic that would get a better response?  When he does come around, how should i act around him?  What do i say, should i even bring it up?  I'm a very open person regarding my feelings and inner workings, and he's obviously not.  If this is just a thing he does, if it's not my fault and there's genuinely nothing i can do to help, how would i even get him to tell me that's the case if he doesn't like talking about it?  When he gets this way i just feel like i'm walking on eggshells around my best friend.  I dunno if it's ok to text, to invite him around, or whatever cause i'm afraid it's gonna bother him and push him further away.  So i'm sure i've left out a lot of details, but i guess that's the gist of it.  I would appreciate any meaningful advice anyone has to offer, especially if anyone around here has experienced anything similar with a friend.

"Consistent problems with friends distancing themselves Really sorry in advance of how long this is!  So some background on me: I’m a 23 year old female. Had a pretty typical life growing up. Had a really stereotypical family - mom, dad, sister, and me. Had good friends growing up, moved schools as a kid only once, and had stuff I was passionate about. During my sophomore year of high school though, my parents got divorced, and shortly after, I had some events happen in my life that sent me into a deep depression. I became suicidal. Now mind you, up through this point, I have had a close knit group of about 8 of us. One girl and I had been friends for almost 7 years and generally I got along with pretty much anyone.   Then this guy I knew from performing arts stuff and I ended up going into a relationship. He was 4 years older than me, meaning he was in college when we started dating, I had barely turned 16 and never had been in a serious relationship, he was charming and wanted me to “not be so naive” and - if you can’t already see the warning signs - this became an extremely abusive relationship, in pretty much every way possible starting with emotional abusive, escalating to physical abuse, and eventually sexual abuse. It completely destroyed me as a person. He forced me to end friendships with anyone who tried to help get away from him, which ended up being all of my friends. Eventually, my college roommate helped me escape from him and helped me to get a restraining order during my Freshman year of college.  Thankfully, I’m in a really wonderful relationship with someone incredibly kind and supportive and have been for nearly 5 years. But with the exception of my boyfriend now, I haven’t been able to connect with people like I used to before that abusive relationship. Some friends I had back then, friends I loved dearly, never forgave me for ending the friendship, despite the fact I never wanted to. And it still really hurts.   I mostly have had off and on friendships through recent years. Mostly the story is: I start talking to a potential friend, we quickly find a bunch of similarities and similar humor, become close really quickly, they become avoidant/ distant/ flakey (or in a recent case - manipulative) and I get upset and end the friendship. I’m quick to forgive and a HUGE pushover, and people really take advantage of this and at some point, I realize this and that’s when I get upset.  The other story is that I start to slowly build friendships, like with people at work, and I think things are going well and I come to realize they don’t really care to be anything more than work friends or they don’t like me as much as I thought they did. I currently have 2 friends that I really care about. One of them lives really far and I only get to see occasionally. The other has started to use the busy excuse with me, but then she plasters her hanging out with everyone but me on social media, but the goes on about how she misses me so much and wishes we could hang out. She literally only lives 20 minutes away and she either flakes or lies about being busy working. It’s starting to really bring me down and I feel really down about it since I feel like it’s something that ultimately ends up happening no matter how hard I try or how good of friends we are.  To sum everything up, I feel like I’m at a loss and I have a hard time connecting with anyone. I feel like people go out of their way to distance themselves from me when I want to actually do ~friend stuff~ like hang out. I feel like I’m missing something.",0,consistent problem friend distancing really sorry advance long is background me year old female pretty typical life growing up really stereotypical family mom dad sister me good friend growing up moved school kid once stuff passionate about sophomore year high school though parent got divorced shortly after event happen life sent deep depression suicidal mind you point close knit group u girl friend year generally got pretty anyone guy knew performing art stuff ended going relationship year older me meaning college started dating barely turned relationship charming wanted not naive warning sign extremely abusive relationship pretty way possible starting emotional abusive escalating physical abuse eventually sexual abuse completely destroyed person forced end friendship tried help away him ended friend eventually college roommate helped escape helped restraining order freshman year college thankfully really wonderful relationship incredibly kind supportive nearly year exception boyfriend now not able connect people like used abusive relationship friend then friend loved dearly forgave ending friendship despite fact wanted to really hurt friendship recent year story is start talking potential friend quickly bunch similarity similar humor close really quickly avoidant distant flakey or recent case manipulative upset end friendship quick forgive huge pushover people really advantage point realize upset story start slowly build friendship like people work think thing going come realize not really care work friend not like thought did currently friend really care about life really far occasionally started use busy excuse me plaster hanging social medium go miss wish hang out literally life minute away flake lie busy working starting really bring feel really feel like ultimately end happening matter hard try good friend are sum up feel like loss hard time connecting anyone feel like people way distance want actually friend stuff like hang out feel like missing something
"Hi everybody! I'm new here and I want to tell my story in brief and ask you a few questions. I'm 27 now. Female. I'm studying on PhD in one of the US universities. I've been suffering from different kinds of psychological problems (mainly, depression) for 7 years already. I always tried to handle my depression by myself. And only once, when depression became unbearable, I went to psychiatrist. I had therapy and AD for a few months. That was about 5-51/2 years ago. Now I have strong depression again. I feel that I can't handle it by myself and that I'm tired of fighting it on my own. That's why I've scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist. My questions: 1. I feel that this depression is different from depressions I experienced before :I started to masturbate like crazy (4-5 times a day) and can't stop - it has been like this for a few weeks already and I seriously started to think about involving  in some homosexual relationship (which I've never done before). I also started to read a lot of porno stories. 2. I'm thinking almost constantly about suicide. I mean, I don't think about committing suicide. NO. I WANT TO LIVE. It's kind of obsessive thought playing in my mind: ""I feel bad ...suicide...many people do that...suicide"". It's kind of always in my mind. Sometimes I even have a feeling of the rope on my neck (I don't think about other kinds of suicide which is, probably, explained by the fact that my father hung himself). 3. Where am I going guys? Am I going to some serious psycho disease or what? Am I still normal (I feel like I'm still normal). Have you ever experienced something like this? Honestly, what I'm afraid of is that at some point I might start seriously consider these suicidal thoughts. I think this is what happened to my dad. 4. I've been here, in the US, only for 1 year. So, I don't know how the system works. If I come to a psychiatrist and tell her that I have these ""suicidal"" thoughts will she make me to be in the hospital (I hate even think about this). Should I even tell her about that? Should I be very honest and open? When I went to our University Health Center to get a referral form, I didn't say anything about that. So, I'm a bit afraid of trusting a psychiatrist. Maybe, I don't need to tell her everything. What would be your advice? I'd greatly appreciate your help.

"Everything's just been hard to deal with lately... I don't really know how to start this, since I'm kind of new to this subreddit, and reddit in general, but I guess I'll try to say this all without embarrassing myself or something of the sort. Lately, I've just been having a tough time, especially since it's the last week before exams in my school. I don't feel any pressure to be doing well at studies anymore, but I do have one friend who *does,* and occasionally, he'll ask for space or something during stressful times so that he doesn't end up lashing out at me, but now, it's just making me feel incredibly lonely. I hate having to watch everyone else give hugs and stuff and just have a good time with their friends while I just keep having to give my friend space. I get that we put this in place to avoid having feelings hurt, but now it just feels... restrictive? It's all kind of hard to describe coherently, and my mind feels all jumbled up, tbh.

Why am I so bad at everything I’m even bad at my own hobbies. I’ve been producing music since like sophomore year of high school and 4 years later I’m still trash. I’ve went to the gym and tried to be consistent but I’m too stupid to work out alone and even though I watch videos on  form I feel like my form is always shitty. I’m shitty at talking to people and making friends. Im losing all my friends because my depression makes me distance myself away from people in hopes of them noticing my absence but no one notices. I’m shitty at school. I’m shitty at driving. I’m shitty at talking to girls. I just prefer to lay down in bed and listen to good music that I’ll never be able to make due to my lack of standing out as a producer.,1,bad bad hobby producing music like sophomore year high school year later trash went gym tried consistent stupid work watch video form feel like form shitty shitty talking people making friend im losing friend depression make distance away people hope noticing absence notice shitty school shitty driving shitty talking girl just prefer lay bed listen good music able make lack standing producer
"I Saw Someone Jump Today I was driving over the main bridge in my city this afternoon. This bridge has been used before. I was driving downtown and I noticed someone on the opposite side of the railing. My girlfriend was in the passenger seat and before I could say anything to her. They were gone. I didn't get to see their face and if I did I think it would've destroyed me. I crossed the bridge, pulled over and called the police. I wish I could've helped, yelled something, gotten out of my car. I don't know. I didn't even know her but I feel as though I've lost someone close.  I struggle with depression myself and I just wish I could've talked to her, I know we could've related on some level. That almost excites me, getting to relate to someone, even over something sad, to just feel that. Thanks for listening.

"Lifelong friend keeps lashing out So I have this friend, she's my best friend and have been forever. ?We've been friends since we were 2, we traveled the world together. We're now 25. She's been through a lot, difficult family stuff, life isn't easy on her at all and her entire life is struggling. Honestly, she needs me. Without me she'd be pretty lost and she knows it. I pretty much take the mothers role. Her mother isn't there (and usually she's more destructive than anything) and I do a lot of the stuff mothers do, including being her punching bag. Because of all of this, she tends to be very impulsive and when she's upset she can say stuff that are very hard for me, like she can get upset with me and then say mean stuff, and that she wants me and everyone else to f-ck of and leave her alone, sometimes worse. It doesn't sound too bad but when it happens repeatedly from a good friend when you try to help her it's really really hard. Every time I have to tell her that it hurts me, I have to practically beg her to say sorry. Eventually she breaks down and says she's so sorry and that she can't control herself. I always forgive. The thing is I know she doesn't mean it. And also I know she's naturally impulsive. But also I don't think she's really trying to control it. I know she's got so much on her plate that it's natural to lose control and not be able to always control everything, but it's really hard for me even though I know she doesn't mean it.  Right now I honestly don't feel like I want to talk to her. I think the fact I ALWAYS forgive makes her not really try to control it. She lost dozens of friends because of it but she know I will always stay. Right now I just feel like telling her that it's been one time too much (I've warned her before that eventually I might just unwillingly break), and that I can't take it. I forgave her probably over a hundred times, seriously. And I honestly care about her, and I honestly know she doesn't mean it, and I honestly worry that without me she won't be able to survive. But also I just can't stand being a punching bag anymore, it's emotionally exhausting and I feel drained. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't live my life like this but I can't live my life knowing that my leaving ruined her, which really might happen.

"I can't do school work and I have no will power left The past two years I've been having a mental battle with myself trying to do my work just to come out with bad grades and disappointment from myself and my parents. I don't if I'm depressed, an idiot, or just a lazy piece of shit but I'm tired of fighting and I just want to throw in the towel. I know my parents just want the best for me but they can't help me. Even when I'm in class it takes all my mental strength to do the simplest things like take notes. The most frustrating part is that nobody thinks I try to do anything. Everyone treats me like a complete dumbass because I can't do my work. I used to have an amazing memory when I was 5-6 years old but when I started elementary school and now it gets worse and worse every year. Sometimes I'll talk to someone and forget what we're talking about in the middle of the conversation for a second. I can't organize anything and I give up before I even try because I know in my head I won't be able to do it anyways. I couldn't pay attention in class if you payed me to do it. And I hate myself for it. I hate that I can't do simple tasks and I that I can't remember anything but I can't control it. It doesn't even feel like I'm in control of my life anymore. Is there anything I can do to help myself. I'm trying to change my diet and meditate as of recent. I want to be in control of myself again.

"I checked myself in to a Mental Hospital I decided after dealing with months of annoying suicidal ideation that I should go to a mental hospital. I say annoying because I was aware of these increased thoughts and wanted nothing to do with killing myself. While I wanted a closed environment away from home stressors to solve my issues I was also afraid of going somewhere unknown. I went through with it (despite crying and feeling emotional on the way there) to get my life turned around.   I feel very often that horror stories are told of hospitals. In reality, if  you need the help, please seek it out. You may have a completely different experience than someone who claims they don't remember their stay and was drugged up to their eyeballs.   My experience was a pleasant one overall. I went there and focused on fixing my issues and I'd say I came out feeling better. I'm not sure if I can or should give the name of the place but I'm sure someone can let me know down below. I just want to share my experience and help people not feel so afraid of going to one.  The place was pretty clean. An adult area for people 18 and over, rooms and halls split by gender. Bathrooms only seemed a bit off towards the end of the day or during the morning when people would shower. Roommates were sweet and tidy thankfully but the option to change roommates if there was a problem was always available to me. Groups were informative and engaging as well as encouraging for others to speak up if they wished. You had a good amount of personal time to do whatever. Outdoor activities were available permitting the weather. The place was meant for short stays of up to a week so anyone who's still there for longer may see the groups as too repetitive. The food was surprisingly delicious and great. Honestly expected school lunch type of food but there was variety and options for those allergic, vegetarian or needing gluten free food. There were staff members around whenever you needed them for anything.   The treatment team could've been better. They were good to me but not to everyone there. Changed meds without informing me. I went from 5 to 10 to 15mg of Abilify. Good Lord I felt it once I was home. Then REALLY felt it when they made a mistake and I went cold turkey for two weeks because I couldn't get my prescription filled. I'll update once I'm properly back on it.  So that's my experience. After a week, I came out feeling better. I got off of Wellbutrin after determining it could be the cause of my increased depression. The Abilify gives me energy to get up and not be stuck in bed all day. I feel better than when I went in.   I know this is a long post, however I've been afraid of sharing my experience with others. I don't want to feel afraid of ashamed of having went, so here I am with this post.   If this is also posted in the wrong place, please let me know and I'll gladly move it to the right subreddit.",1,checked mental hospital decided dealing month annoying suicidal ideation mental hospital say annoying aware increased thought wanted killing myself wanted closed environment away home stressor solve issue afraid going unknown went despite cry feeling emotional way there life turned around feel horror story told hospital reality need help seek out completely different experience claim not remember stay drugged eyeball experience pleasant overall went focused fixing issue say came feeling better not sure place sure let know below just want share experience help people not feel afraid going one place pretty clean adult area people over room hall split gender bathroom bit end day morning people shower roommate sweet tidy thankfully option change roommate problem available me group informative engaging encouraging speak wished good personal time whatever outdoor activity available permitting weather place meant short stay week longer group repetitive food surprisingly delicious great honestly expected school lunch type food variety option allergic vegetarian needing gluten free food staff member needed anything treatment team better good not there changed med informing me went mg abilify good lord felt home really felt mistake went cold turkey week not prescription filled update properly it experience week came feeling better got wellbutrin determining cause increased depression abilify give energy not stuck bed day feel better went in know long post afraid sharing experience others not want feel afraid ashamed having went post posted wrong place let know gladly right subreddit

"Leapfrogger/Friend Stealer/Friend Poacher etc. Just for some context in my form group (like a morning register class or a house class as some call it) I sat at a table with people I didn't really talk to, but since I couldn't change seats I decided to make some friends with people at the table.  In grade/year 8 or 9 I met two guys who are now great friends of mine, one I talk to more than the other since he stayed at home instead of at school due to health issues. Fast forward a few months and you have the situation above. So I started talking about a common interest with this guy we shall name Manny, now Manny and I only talked in form, and after I would go back to my main social circle with my best mate. After a while (about grade 9-10 maybe) I decided Manny should go and chat with me and my best mate's social circle for once, so introduced them both to each other, and they got on well.  Now between year 10-11 I definitely noticed that Manny started taking more of my best mates interest, which makes sense and happens often so I didn't think of it. It only caught my attention when my best mate stopped inviting me to events such as hangouts at the park and going on cinema trips with my other friend who stays at home. Instead he would invite Manny and Manny would invite him and some of my other friends to many events like the cinema and sleepovers and whatnot. Over time I would be completely excluded from my friends activities and everytime invited them to do something, they would say ""im not sure if i can go"" only for me to find out they went with Manny somewhere.

" In this process of letting go, I am finding that the most courageous act I can to is to also  let in . Change is the only constant in life, but it never seems to get any easier to move beyond the attachments of my heart and head.   I find that sharing my stories is a part of my process of healing.  It provides release, but also accountability.  In a way, this log is a letter to my future self; a reminder; a chronicalling.    Taylor and I have broken up more times in the past 9 years than I can even begin to count, and in recent years those endings have been becoming more and more final, as we sought other loves and different paths.  But we always seemed to find our way back to each other again.   This time there is a sense of finality.  Despite our best efforts, we just can't seem to move beyond our struggles.  It is heartbreaking to think of leaving behind my best friend and all of the dreams we shared for our future, but it is also exciting to think of the possibilities life has in store for us.    I take solace in the small things...  Puddle jumping on my way to the corner market this morning Birds enjoying all of their new baths after the rains last night Kids in a single file line on their way to a field trip  I am seeking new adventures: meeting new people, exploring new places, new things.... Letting in and  taking in   the world with a new perspective, a lightness, an openess.   The past 3 years have brought a lot of loss and lessons.  I have had to mourn my grandparents for the second time as the dome was sold.  I had to let go of Taylor to be with Mark, who brought a lot of joy, but even more heartache, and then regret that I had hurt Taylor to pursue such a fruitless endeavor.   I have always tried to follow my heart at any given moment, and sometimes the choices that follow are painstakingly difficult.  I can't help but feel that some of those choices have contributed to these insurmountable trials between Taylor and I.  He moved on long ago.    And now I must begin to.    I have learned so much in the last few years; about love and life, and mostly about myself.   I live my life with the faith that everything happens just as it is meant to.

"Yep - I know this all too well. And it is a sad state of affairs. But you are aware of it. Best you know what is going on than be surprised. SN, I hear what you are saying about not being able to weather another strike against your stability now. And I hope you do not have to go. I will pray with you that you are spared from the cuts this time, but while you are praying and hoping, consider the issue of your personal power. If you are feeling shaky in other areas of life, I doubt that you feel that you have any. I have been in that situation over many things. Remember the difference between what you DO have control over and what you do NOT have control over: you can control the way you approach this job, your punctuality, your diligence, your politeness to other workers; you CANNOT control the decisions made on the top and how they will affect your status. I have been reading a book called ""Corporate Confidential"" by Cynthia Shapiro. She was an HR manager for her whole life and spills the beans on how companies decide who will stay and who will go. It was an eye-opener for me. Perhaps it can help you at this juncture. In your own prayers, remember to ask God not just for the optimal decision to be made on your behalf, but for the power to see where you do and do not have control and for help taking charge of the areas that you actually can control. When you are in a phase of instability, it seems that more and more garbage gets thrown your way. But a turning point comes when the indignation of being tossed on everyone else's sea propels you into action. That turning point came for me about 9 years ago when a really awful roommate had to be ejected. I felt a power I had never felt before - the ability to take charge of my own life, not waiting for someone else's decision to tell me whether I was going to be OK or not. I am trying to find my way back to that point. I hope you do too. It can happen.",1,yep know well sad state affair aware it best know going surprised sn hear saying not able weather strike stability now hope not go pray spared cut time praying hoping consider issue personal power feeling shaky area life doubt feel any situation thing remember difference control not control over control way approach job punctuality diligence politeness worker control decision affect status reading book called corporate confidential cynthia shapiro hr manager life spill bean company decide stay go eyeopener me help juncture prayer remember ask god not just optimal decision behalf power not control help taking charge area actually control phase instability garbage get thrown way turning point come indignation tossed sea propels action turning point came year ago really awful roommate ejected felt power felt ability charge life not waiting decision tell going ok not trying way point hope too happen
"People are NOT who they seem. I originally wrote a long post detailing the specifics of what just happened to me, but I decided not to. All I'm saying is, **don't** trust anybody. You have **zero** assurance that people who act nice and fine when you're around are really nice and fine towards you when your back's turned.  I wouldn't have known the true, judgmental, and frankly I have no fucking idea where in the ass of God did they pull all their judgmental shit - if I hadn't snooped and read text messages of my mother to other people. Hell, my own mother's in it, too!  ""Hide the knife, he might stab our son (my stepfather)."" ""You're sick, go to a doctor for a checkup. You can't give up, please don't die. We pity your son. He can't survive without you. He'll burn all the money with booze. He'll be homeless and sleep on the streets.""  Jesus Fucking Christ. What in the actual fuck? I don't even drink. Jesus Christ. What the fuck. The judgment. Dear fucking Christ I could not believe nor comprehend how this people even came to whatever bullshit thought/idea they came to.  Suddenly, I'm back down to self-doubt and I can feel depression clawing at me, it's trying to rip me apart again. But, no more. I'm pushing it back. I've confirmed EVERYTIME, that family is my main source of toxicity. FUCK THAT.  I'm being ganged up on by everyone in this house, and their relatives, and every single one of my relatives. I once questioned if I was the one at fault. I mean, if EVERYBODY hated you, you're probably doing something wrong. UNLESS, you're just that damn unlucky and every single one of your relative is a fucking asshole. I've heard of those stories before, so it isn't impossible - and I think that's the case with me.  Jesus. For now, I'm playing the game they wanna play. They wanna be fake with me, I'll be fake with them. I act all fine and dandy around my mother and everyone else. I smile, I joke. All a facade.

"Some days I function fine and everything seems ""normal"", other days everything feels foreign. Sometimes I can do whatever and it just feels like any other day. On other days, I'm freaking the fuck out. It feels like I don't know how to do anything because everything seems so unfamiliar. From walking down the road to the grocery store to brushing my teeth. It's funny now when I think about it because it's all so easy :D",1,day function fine normal day feel foreign just feel like day day freaking fuck out feel like not know unfamiliar walking road grocery store brushing teeth funny think easy
" it's really sad when God takes away a life... especially when it's someone close to you.. especially when it's too soon.. like you wish that you could've spent more time with that person. you never realized how much they meant to you until they're gone. i guess it's part of life, to teach us how precious life is and how we shouldn't take it for granted. just came back from krish's cremation.. krish was this guy in my grade... never knew him well, since i only met him this year, but he was the first guy to talk to me at ASB. i still remember the first day, on the bus, he was like, ""hi!.. you're in 10th grade too?.. i'm a new student..."" and after that simple gesture, we started talking... when we arrived at school we didn't know where to go, so he was all, ""let's just go together... :)"" and after we found our own groups of friends, we sort of drifted awei... i regret it though.. i wish i could've learned more about him rather than shun him away. i never even knew the little details about him, like about his family or his past... i guess i learned that we shouldnt take anyone for granted.. coz tomorrow they might be gone just like that. the cremation was held in this Wat in Soi Ekkamai.. i've never been in a thai-style funeral, but it was pretty much the same... almost everyone at ASB was there.. not to mention all his old friends in NIST, RIS, ISB... there were about 500 + people!!!... and almost everyone was crying (including me.. hehe!)!... it just goes to show how much he touched everyone's lives in different levels... when they cremated him, they put inside his possessions, like a soccer ball and his favorite shoes, his cell and some cards and letters we made... and then they played ""i'll be missing you"" by p.diddy and faith evans... :( i'm gonna be thinkin of him every time i hear that song!!!

"Drug addict friend!!? I have had this best friend for over 8 years now. We were childhood friends and basically grew up together. The past 2 years were a little rough because he started to drink heavily in high school. Later on he started to dabble into drugs  and the “party life”. Once he started doing that, I kind of distanced myself because I didn’t know how to react. I was kind of mad but also sad so I didn’t really talk to him as much. Fast forward to now, I talk to him more but I don’t know if it will ever be the same. He is always talking about trying new drugs and doing all this stuff at parties which tbh I don’t really care for. Should I still attempt to have that relationship we once had? I still care for him but it’s so hard to listen and be there for him when he’s putting himself in dangerous situations. If I stop being friends with him, does that make me a bad friend for not sticking through it? Should I stay friends to try and make a positive environment?

" This is kind of a wierd thing, having the opportunity to write about nothing in particular with no intended audience.  I'm not really sure if this is something I will do or not, but maybe I'll give it a whirl and see how it goes.  Basically, here's my story: I'm from a small town in southwestern Minnesota.  I grew up raising cattle and growing corn, wheat, and soybeans.  I had and still have both my parents as well as a brother and two sisters.  I was a smart kid in my high school and was always in the top of my class.  I never partied or got in trouble and was generally a good kid.     Then I went to college.   I went to NDSU in Fargo, ND in the fall of 1997.  There I learned to appreciate the sweet necture of life that was and is beer.  There I met some of my best friends and learned of the best mixes of all manners of alcohol.  We partied hard for 2 wonderful years.  Then, I got a letter from the dean.  I was asked not to come back to NDSU in the fall.  They figured that having 2 years to think about things, I'd be better off.     Well, what's a guy to do?     This guy decided he needed to get his head on straight.  I went out to work as a camp cook at a bible camp I had went to as a kid.  It was a rustic fort in the Black Hills of South Dakota with no electricity or running water.  All I had to cook with was a fire and a hand pump.  It was wonderful.  We'd shower only once a week, hike miles a day, and have lots of time just to commune with nature.     While I was out at the camp I talked with a friend who was changing schools.  The four-year schooling at a ""typical"" college was wearing on him and he needed something different.  He was joining up with a buddy that went to a Tech School for Fluid Power Technology (hydraulics and pneumatics primarily).  Well, I thought that sounded as good as any options I had so I signed up over the phone.  Never set foot in the building til the first day of class.  Turned out, that was one of the best decisions I ever made.   But, that's probably enough for now.  If anybody's even reading this, I'll fill some more in later.

"I've been reading this subreddit for awhile. Well, as the title says I have been reading this stuff for months. I think I'm depressed. I'm not sure why though. I have a really good long-term boyfriend, everything I need and a lot of things I just want. I've been ""depressed"" as long as I can remember. I think about killing myself every day, multiple times a day. Like, ""oh, i dropped something, well better kill myself"" ""Oh, I failed that math problem, you're worthless better kill yourself now"" I can barely shower most days. I don't know why my boyfriend hasn't broken up with me. Sometimes I wish he would so I could just kill myself. I feel really bad for him.   I have anger issues I think, My moods change really fast, it is hard to keep up with them and I don't know why it happens. Most days I don't want to get out of bed. I don't have any friends. I always feel like everyone hates me.   It would just be so much easier to die, why do people bother with life? What is the point? Everyone has always said that things ""get better"" but they don't really. They change and then something else sucks.  Nothing makes me happy, I don't enjoy doing anything that I can do by myself. I hate being alone, I hate my own company. I guess I just hate myself. Is this depression? Do I just suck? Maybe I'm just being dramatic.   I wanna be a better person but I don't know how. My anxiety feels like a prison. It's really hard for me to leave the house. I HATE being around people, but I don't want to be alone either. Going to the store is a nightmare for me, the panic attacks and worrying I'm in someones way all the time. I only go in the middle of the night and never by myself.   What is wrong with me? Why can't I do things normal people do? Is there any point in existing when you always feel miserable? This is the most awkward thing I've done in awhile, Time to take a nap and forget I posted here.

" Hello. I'm so glad you've come. Would you like a cup of tea? I like mine with two heaped spoons of sugar and full-cream milk. But you can have yours any way you like. I'm not going to stop you.   Well, I might as well introduce myself, since you've made it this far. And you look like you're comfortable so I've got nothing to lose.    My name is Mrs Walker and I am 26 years old. I live in a pink square house on Harlem Avenue, in a working class neighborhood ten miles west of the Chicago loop. My husband, Mr. Walker, and I, bought the house in April and we moved in on May 1.   Our house is different from other houses. From Harlem Avenue, our house looks just like a pink square lego brick that's come alive and has grown eyes and a mouth. In front of the house is a strawberry field and there are five fruit trees on our double lot. We have grape vines growing over the deck and peonies, roses and other exotic looking flowers exploding all over our Chicago plot. On the other half of the lot (it's a double) are neat blocks of soil divided by wooden walkways. We have planted corn, brocolli, carrots, beans, tomatoes, peppers and herbs here. Every day my husband and I look on in astonishment as the plants rise up out of the ground in their mission to feed us.   When we first looked at the house in March this year, we had no idea what was already in the ground. The stawberry plants, berries and grapevines have all burst forth since we moved in. In the last two weeks we have picked perhaps half a dozen pounds of strawberries. We've given away baskets to friends and I took a couple quarts into the office one day. We've made strawberry jam and I tried strawberry fudge but I didn't wait for the mixture to get hot enough and it didn't set. I threw the whole pan of fudge out and only had to feel guilty about the dollar or so that I spent on the can of evaporated milk, and the three cups of sugar.   Well, that is not exactly true. I was sorely devastated by my failed fudge attempt and I bought new ingredients at the grocery store today. In fact I'm going to attempt a new batch again right now. If it turns out alright this time, I'll share the recipe with you.   So please come back to visit. Next time I may even have a chocolate biscuit for you to eat with your tea.

"I was just reading back over the past few entries. I have been in tough shape and I didn't realize how tough until I read it over. The depression, the arthritis, and the circumstances of my life all have been conspiring to keep me down.  My therapist was right, I think, when she said on Monday that I needed sometime to just ""be"". I've stopped answering my phone and have spend most of the past few days watching DVDs, playing computer games and resting my sore body. I feel better emotionally since I have been doing this. I wish I didn't feel so horribly guilty for checking out of the world for a few days, but I'm willing to cope with it if it makes ma feel a little better. The other thing I am feeling guilty about is this training I am supposed to go to in Washington, DC in two weeks. I feel like if I go I will be letter all sorts of people down at work. I have even contacted the people running the training and asked if I can delay it, but it is now or never and since it is all expenses paid in Washington for three days if I pass it up at the last minute I am screwing someone else out of the opportunity. If I go or if I don't go I am going to feel guilty and selfish. I'm not going to decide now though.

"this is my first post , so bare with me. I have been married a year and just found out some interesting news about my husband. He told me that the man he calls dad is not really his father. He told me that his mother never told him until he was 13 years old, and had to go to court to change his name. I always wondered why, he and his father never got along. His mother won't tell him who his real father is. I feel I need to help him find him, so he can close the door, and get answers to all his questions. My husband does not like to talk about feelings, he was raised in a family where no one talked about feelings and if you had a problem you  kept it to yourself. I was raised totally opposite. In ways this has left him hurt and confused. He feels like he doesn't belong sometimes. He told me sometimes he would like to know who his dad is and other times he could care less. But, it seems like it is always on his mind, when family issues come about. The man that raised him, is an issue all to his own, he is very abusive, physically, and mentally. He is always telling my husband, he is wrong and will never be able to be successful.  He has heard that all his life, but he has never believed it - he is strong and has a good heart - It just hurts me when I see him lash out. He takes all his problems out on me, I now understand why.   I have not told him, but I found out who his father is. All I have is a name. I want to tell him but don't know if I should. I don't want his mother not to talk to him if he knows - I'm very confused - I'm right in the middle and don't want anyone to get hurt. Looking for advice - or someone that can relate to this.

" Hello,      I am trying this blog thing for the first time, I kinda like the idea of it... today has started off pretty good, I still have to vacum the house... yesterday was a great day... unfortunatly the voices in my head keep on telling me to do things, things they have never told me to do before... they used to always tell me to kill and to hurt... but now they are trying to help me I think, you see, yesterday I went to the mall with my girlfriend, and we went and saw a movie together. My voices only come out in the dark and it happened to be just dark enough in the theater for me to hear them. Throught the whole movie they were telling me to do stuff like, put my arm around her, kiss her, stuff like that... sometimes it got plain disturbing the things they told me (I won't repeat them...) but overall yesterday was an awesome day... last night though, when I got home, they ""punished"" me for the times that I wouldn't listen to them... they were screaming inside my head that I am worthless, that I have no chance of having a real life if I refuse to listen to them... and last night I had a dream about what it would have been like had I listened to them... I don't know what to do... I think that they are trying to trick me to trusting them so that they can eventually have me do things that I will really regret... but I don't know... also... my girlfriend's ex, Richie (grr... must... kill..), keeps on telling her that she has to break up with me and start talking to him again in order for her to have a chance of getting back into thespians, god, I truly do hate him... he is using things that I can't stand that I said against me now... and it really get's to my girlfriend... god, I love her so frigin much... but I just don't know what to do sometimes... I think, hell, I know she still has feelings for him... but I couldn't confront her about them in a million years... my best friend, kevin, thinks that I should break up with her... but god, i just couldn't bear to do such a thing... well, I'd better go...

"{Experience} Angry Sibling I have a sister who will tell you she's the most laid-back of us all, but the truth is her anger will zoom from zero to 10 in the blink of an eye.  When we converse she will criticize or take exception with something I've said and I have to gently remind her that I'm only telling her how I *feel*; I'm not disagreeing with her opinion, or whatever.  Thing is, it's getting more and more difficult to talk with her as it seems as though *ANYTHING* sets her off these days!  And while I've nothing at all against Bill Burr - I actually think he's hilarous! - talking to her is like trying to talk back to one of his on-stage rants, understand?!  Because he's ranting to be funny, but she actually means what she says.  I love this sister, and am closer to her than many of the five sisters I have, but I'm beginning to point this out to her because I don't think she realizes the way she sounds.

I went to my mom’s house and when I got there, there were guests staying over that I didn’t know. I have very severe social anxiety so this is not good. When I called my mom before driving to her house, she specifically said that no guests were over and it was okay to come. She lied.   I went inside the house and asked my mom about the guests, she told me that she intentially lied to me because she wanted me to come over and knew that I wasn’t going to come over if there were guests there.    I freaked out. My mom completely disrespected my boundaries and said the equivalent of “fuck your social anxiety, do what I want”   I quickly left the house and went back into my car. I wanted to leave there because I knew I couldn’t handle socializing with other people. However, my mom followed me back into my car and started to ask why I was leaving. I tell her that she lied to me and I can’t take deal with my social anxiety. She says she doesn’t believe my social anxiety is real (mind you, I’ve spent two month in a psychiatric hospital last year) and says she wants me to stay. I tell her fuck off and get out of my car but she doesn’t leave.   At this point I don’t know what to do so I freak out. We have an argument for an hour. She’s not leaving my car and is yelling at me. We eventually decide that I should go to my sisters house to sleep.     I leave but now I have so much anxiety that I can’t drive. I park my car in a nearby parking lot deciding what I want to do. I have so much anxiety at this point that I made a post of /r/suicidewatch but quickly deleted it.    Then my mom calls me and eventually asks me if I am driving to my sisters house. I don’t respond to the question because I don’t want to lie, and she finds out that Icwas nearby.    She freaks out. She accuses me of lying to her when I didn’t lie. She then takes her car and starts to find where I was. She finds me and then we have an argument for two hours. She keeps on yelling at me saying that I should come back to the house and “forget about my anxiety”. I tell her I wanted to go back to the psychiatric ward in the hospital and she says that I’m being fucking ridiculous and should stop thinking like this.    She eventually leaves my car saying that I should come sleep in her house and that “everything will be fine”.

The enthusiasm is disproportionate to some of the things she's done. She's given me thoughtful gifts like chocolates, books or an adult colouring book (I like art). But when we travelled around together she put up stark boundaries - like she'd not even let me in her room to help her out with a mouse which showed up, even though she complained like she needed the help. Also, she only makes the time to reply to my messages about once per week. I can say that confidently because I know she's online most of the time on Facebook. I can see it.

"I want to share my experience moving to NYC from Israel - four months ago Hello everyone,     I just thought it would do good for me to share my experience moving to this city among other new yorkers and maybe hearing some new voices of people who are living here and know better than me or even went through the same thing.      So basically, I'm 28 years old and moved to NYC four months ago with my wife. My wife is doing her Ph.D. at Columbia University, and I just joined her (with a work permit during our stay here), and we are going to be here for at least 3.5 years, but we could choose to stay for five years if we wish to. (At the moment I don't see it happening)      I have to say that moving here has been the most difficult challenge I've ever been through in my life. First, though my English is not bad at all, I'm SO, SO insecure about it. I'm feeling afraid to open my mouth and say complicated things, and it is depressing me. (I am a person who's talking a lot by nature. I've always been like that) And I feel like someone took away that ability from me and I'm much less charismatic in English than in Hebrew which affects my confidence tremendously... After smoking weed for 4-5 years almost every day in Israel, I quit doing it since the first month I got here only because it made me feel very anxious (it used to make me feel quite the opposite before)      I used to be a teacher in Israel and pretty quickly I've found a job as a teacher that teaches Hebrew here in New York. (In Israel I used to teach History which I found much more interesting than teaching a language, but that's what I got here, so I have to live with that) A few days ago, I had a conversation with my boss, and apparently, they are pleased by my work there, and they asked me if I am willing to continue for next year which is nice to hear even though I don't like this job that much. I guess I will have to compromise.       My wife and I are supported by an excellent scholarship, and we don't have to worry a lot about money or health insurance so, on the financial field, we are kinda covered. But being here makes me feel powerless. Obviously, I don't have my good friends here with me, and I feel much less ""special"" as a person. I feel like I am only one among millions who are trying to survive in this big hectic city. In the beginning, I thought it is beautiful that this city is full of people from all around the world, but now it just feels to me that everyone are strangers to each other and it seems like it is the loneliest city in the world at the moment.       And because I don't have friends here and I am married (so meeting with girls on tinder etc. is not an option) I don't have many reasons to leave the house and it is kinda sad. The only reasons I'm leaving my house is for yoga classes, work, and restaurants with my wife. Other than that I don't have any other reasons to leave the house... The weather is fucking horrible, and it is so cold it is painful to me being outside.       Anyways, I don't expect from you guys to be my therapist or giving me some life-changing advices... I guess I post this to release some steam. So if you managed to read my post until the end, Thank you :) And I hope things will improve for me. I've always lived in Israel and only left for trips. The longest was 3-4 months, and I have never relocated my life to anywhere else. So maybe it is just a matter of time until I will start to feel more like home here. If you have anything to share from your experience, that would be lovely just to know that I am not the only one who is going through this adjustment period.       Thanks again for reading and for your patience.

" So we did the Oklahoma thing.  It was actually a very beautiful lake.  On Saturday, as soon as we got into OK, it started pouring.  We were worried that our fun-filled weekend would be ruined because of the rain.  We had nothing to do.  We decided to see DODGEBALL, which was silly.  When we came out of the movies, the sun was out and the sky started to clear.  We dashed over to the lake to rent a kayak.  It was really nice and not too hot since it had been raining all day.  We then ate dinner at a local restaurant.   Sunday's weather was better.  My husband enjoyed the scuba diving, though it was not my cup of tea.  I am not certified and just sat on the shore, under the trees, trying to avoid the sun.  I told him that I might not go with him the next time he decided to dive, since it is not very interesting for me.  I know he enjoys it so much, but is definitely not a spectator sport.   I am teaching classes in a summer program for high school students.  It is going well, though some of the kids don't seem to care very much about the program.  They seem to be determined to get kicked out of the program (which will provide college tuition upon successful completion ).  I don't know.  Hopefully these kids will wake up and realize that this is a unique opportunity before they are removed.  I know that they deal with difficult stuff at home - things that I never had to deal with. . . .

"I feel like nothing matters, so why try? Hey guys, I've decided to turn to reddit to try to get some help with my lack of motivation.  Recently I've felt like nothing matters in the end, and nothing I do makes a difference. We're on a random rock floating through space in a universe thats bigger than we could ever fathom and we don't understand, and we think that things that we do matter.  I feel like I've heard ""just because nothing matters doesn't mean you can't be happy"" a thousand times, and while it sounds good, I can't get passed my negative view on things. I honestly wish that I thought that way, but that's not how I think.  I guess I posted this to try to get different perspective.

"Too cowardice or just selfish? So English is not my first language so there might be some grammar mistakes but this has been bugging me for a while now. There was this girl I met some time during my last year of middle school and I guessed she took an interest in me, I was pretty confused as I wasn't the type to stand out much and I wouldn't talk at all unless someone comes up and starts a conversation with me. And she was the one to do that - uh, during a school graduation ceremony, of course. After that, we went to different high schools but still kept in touch.  So overtime, after the graduation, we kind of became close, as friends. Well I didn't have many friends to start with so I spent a lot of time talking to her about all kind of stuff and I was devoted, if she was sad I would spend my day trying to cheer her up or yes, I wouldn't push her to say what was on her mind if she didn't want to share but yeah, I could do anything to make her happy because as I said before, I didn't have many friends, I was bullied and she was the first one to be so kind to me - all my ""friends"" kind of just sided with the bullies when they knew I was the target. At one point, I thought I was in love with her. But that was the part I would feel guilty whether it came up, I thought because she was the popular type, and she had a boyfriend, dating her was something I could never do. But then she broke up with her boyfriend (it was some kind of argument over some disagreements iirc), I was happy about it but it just wasn't the right time, she was sad and she would spent the whole summer the following year after we met just talking with me about stuff and as we could do some drawings, we kind of made a world of our own and we would stay up until 2 in the morning everyday just to think of a concept for that universe (it's like making a comic or something, I'm a big nerd for world concepts) so it was like I was bonded with her. Anyways I think I'm being too informative about this so I'll just skip to the main point. After that, about 6 months or so I tried to be an understanding friend and I didn't take a single opportunity to try to flirt with her as I knew I would be a dick if I had done that - well because I thought I shouldn't pressure her into a relationship whereas she just got out of one.  So anyways, after a year, she got over it, I thought it was the right time for me but I didn't have the confidence to confess because I was overprotective of her as she didn't/doesn't have a good family and I was more like a big brother to her, because she was the one who wasn't good with dealing problems and I've lived my whole life dealing with all kinds of problems so I had a good view of dealing with them (I won't go into details as it would be another really long story) - So the idea of us dating was kind of ridiculous - I still don't know if she ever felt the same way. So I tried to change for the better, I went out to socialize more (it was exhausting but hey, there are things you would do for love), I worked out to lose weight so she doesn't feel embarrassed if we were to get together (she doesn't say it but I know she doesn't even want to date a fat guy) - I wanted to be a good partner for her, I know I wouldn't be the best but I could try. I tried to be someone reliable because I know full well she kind of looked down on me, how she tried to prove that she's better than me at everything (she is, at some fields). But the distressing part was that she started changing, she is still popular (yup, up until now), but she had more outbursts, she was constantly crying and whether I came up to ask her what was wrong she would throw a fit at me so I thought I was invading her privacy too much so I didn't say anything anymore, I was just there, trying to be supportive. So for the second time, I let go of another opportunity for a girlfriend.  (you can actually skip the first two parts but I just felt like going into details, sorry)  The third time, I thought it was time to make a move and she met a girl and fell in love with her instantly, I was supportive of her regardless. The latter one was also attracted to her so I thought just what kind of person would be so selfish to stop their bestfriend from getting in another relationship. I mean, honestly, I never had any luck with girls so I could just wait for later, her being happy was my priority. Yeah, so ever since I tried to change, I was better at talking. So I helped them get together, how to reply just to get the other one to be her girlfriend. And after that, our friendship was getting better. I thought I was the happiest person at the time, but another part of me was devastated. That part was well hidden for quite some time but it grew, it hated her girlfriend, it hated the fact that I was being too devoted and never got anything in return (I didn't quite expect anything in return from the start but I guess my feelings piled up). And before I knew it, I was being a control freak, I hated the other one not out of jealousy, but rather because she brought her down - her girlfriend was suicidal, she kept saying how she wanted to die - well I could careless about that because I knew lovers don't like bestfriends. That is, until she started saying how she wanted to die, she was constantly whining, crying and whether I asked her she just said nothing was wrong and kept on doing so. And whether I tried to talk some sense into her she just replied with a single ""Ok."" and it was bugging me. And she spent most of her time talking to her girlfriend and kinda just went anywhere with her, I never knew what was going on in her life anymore at this point. Now I'm not that small to start hating her for that, I let it slide anyways, though it bugged the hell out of me. So as you all know how important your last year of highschool is, she kind of just felt so down she lost a great deal of weight but it's kinda weird how I started to careless about details, about her too, of course, guessing because I was let down so many times. But anyways, my feelings for her started to fade, but regardless, I still tried to cheer her up, pushing her to study but she gave me the cold shoulders and even got mad at me for ""interfering"" with her life. And ever since we talked less. Then lately I don't know what is wrong with me but I just started feeling hatred for her. I didn't even blame myself for that. I just...Hated her. But for some reasons, I can't quite tell her and I don't even know why, why our distance grew and why I loved her and now I hate her.

"All I am on this earth for is to die. What is so great about living. Everyone is going to die eventually. Why wait? Just get it over with. If god is so fucking great then why does he put humans on the earth that feel lost, sad, lonely, depressed, and worthless? Why do we all feel this way if god is wonderful? FUCK GOD! We're all in this world to eventually die. I want out. I hate the world, i hate myself, i hate the sun, i hate the moon, i hate everyone i know, i hate hating, but worst of all i hate love. when i love someone why don't they love me back? when i trust someone why must they lie to me? WHY?!?!?! Why is the world the way it is? why am i the way i am? Why are there so many worthless, hopeless, depressed people in the world that they have to make web sites?? Why is this the only way and the only time i can ever share my feeling? Why am i depressed? Do you want to know? ............... because i got raped and abused for 8 years. because i had my childhood taken away from me by a person that i trusted my life with, by the person that i called my father. My step dad raped me for 8 years, since i was 8 years old until a few months ago. Why didn't i tell anyone? why couldn't i speak up? ..... because he told me they wouldn't believe me, it would ruin the family. my mom would hate me. well he was right about one thing it did ruin the family, but they did believe me and my mom still loves me. it ruined the family for a better cause. i don't ever have to see or talk to my step dad ever again. so why do i still feel this way?. ...... because my mom still loves him, she is torn between us and she never really took my side and helped me through this. For 8 years of my life i had to pretend to be happy and normal. i had to push everything in the back off my mind and cry every night. i had to wonder why he was doing this to me, i thought he loved me. He had been my father since i was 2. how could he betray me like this and hurt me. how could he take away my childhood. from that i learned that in the end everything will be bad and nothing is ever what it seems. I had to grow up so fast, i had to realize how the world really was. i had to lie and keep secrets. I learned to hide everything even myself, even my soul. It took me 8 years of pain and suffering. of growing, thinking and knowing. of wishing, hoping and dreaming. to finally speak up. To finally show myself. to make my soul vulnerable. To cry a million tears that i could never cry before. but now that i can be me and show myself, i don't like myself. All the pain and misery. the secrets and lies. the memories and nightmares. this all was building up inside of me for 8 years. Now its showing and I'm a bitter and sad person. I was on the verge of exploding and now its taking me along time to get all this build up out of me. I've never really discovered who i really am. I pretended for 8 years and now all the hurt and bitterness is showing. When and if that's all gone what will i really be like? i can't even picture myself being happy or excited. I can't picture my self in color when everything around me including me is gray and bleak. Will anyone ever love me? I try to love people but they always hurt me and i know that it will always be that way .......................................................",1,earth die great living going die eventually wait just with god fucking great doe human earth feel lost sad lonely depressed worthless feel way god wonderful fuck god world eventually die want out hate world hate myself hate sun hate moon hate know hate hating worst hate love love not love back trust lie me why world way is way am worthless hopeless depressed people world make web site way time share feeling depressed want know got raped abused year childhood taken away person trusted life with person called father step dad raped year year old month ago did not tell anyone not speak up told not believe me ruin family mom hate me right thing did ruin family did believe mom love me ruined family better cause not talk step dad again feel way mom love him torn really took helped this year life pretend happy normal push mind night wonder doing me thought loved me father betray like hurt me away childhood learned end bad seems grow fast realize world really wa lie secret learned hide myself soul took year pain suffering growing thinking knowing wishing hoping dreaming finally speak up finally myself make soul vulnerable million tear before myself not like myself pain misery secret lie memory nightmare building inside year showing bitter sad person verge exploding taking time build me really discovered really am pretended year hurt bitterness showing gone really like picture happy excited picture self color including gray bleak love me try love people hurt know way

"Why I’m leaving When I was a kid a had an accident in which I chipped both my front teeth. I was 12 back then, so my dad had the funds and everything but he never wanted to take me to the dentist which went unnoticed for 4 years and just a chip on my tooth became a huge problem, I got a gap and they look uglier than they did. Anyways the thing is just right when i was going to get the work done my dad got deported and I stayed by myself.

"Reddit Secret Santa Saved My Life... I want to begin this by saying that I've been in a really dark place recently. Combination of family issues, breakup, and finals put me in a really depressive state. As a result, I'd been having strong suicidal thoughts for weeks. I had been seriously thinking about ending my own life. So that's the context in which this occurs.   About a month ago I signed up for secret santa on a whim. I had never done it before and honestly didn't expect anything. But yesterday, my gift arrived. I don't know who this person is, but they spent at least $150 dollars on about 6 separate gifts. They also included a really thoughtful and touching letter that talked about how they thought I was such a great person and how much they enjoyed learning about me.   I immediately broke down crying upon reading it.   It might seem small or sorta stupid, but it made me feel like someone cared about me. That I wasn't the idiotic nobody my depression tells me I am all of the time. I felt motivated and happy for the first time in weeks. I cleaned my room and did work that I'd been ignoring for months. I finally felt like maybe, just maybe, I meant something.   It changed my life, and probably saved it.   So whoever you are, thank you so much, and I can't express how much this meant to me or thank you enough.   And let this be a lesson to everyone else. The smallest act can and does make a difference. Let's all try and use the Christmas season to ensure everyone feels a little more loved.

"What's wrong with this friendship? I need some thoughts on this situation.  Three friends of 20 years decide a month a head of time to go to a Gatsby Party for New Years Eve. All of them are single. Well, at least one of them is somewhat single. The less-single one is Charlotte. Charlotte has a new beau, who she has been seeing on the low for about two months. Melanie and Jenny can see that Charlotte is smitten. Ok, no big deal. All is good. ""Do you, girlfriend! Just don't lose yourself"". (Names have been changed)  So everyone is planning for the NYE party. Melanie and Jenny have their outfits ready to go. The dress that Charlotte ordered is not going to be in on time for the party, so the back-up plan is to go the mall and find a new dress. Melanie goes with her, and Charlotte, reluctantly buys the best dress she can find, but it is not nearly as fabulous as the first dress she ordered online - which, again, won't arrive on time.  The ladies planned to all go to Melanie's house early on the day of NYE to slowly get ready, play some good music, eat pizza and have a few drinks before they summon the Uber to take them to the party.  The night before, however, the party's promoters announce on facebook that the venue has changed to another location. A little aggravating, but not a big deal. They decide they're not gonna let that mess up their NYE and want to have fun anyway.  Anyhow, on Jan 31, at 5pm-ish, Charlotte sends a group text to the other ladies:  Hey ladies, i know you'll probably hate me for this, but I'm not gonna go. I wasn't feeling it since they announced the change of venue and now James asked me to go to Vegas. So I rather do that. I apologize for the late notice"".  Needless to say, the other women were very upset.  Any thoughts?

" there are so many people in the world. Some of us are trained and broken and some of us are jst broken by choice. Reality sucks and everyone knows it. If you want a meaning in life then you have to find it. But if you want to suceed in life you have to be buried in it.Is there really a choice in what we want? Why do people hate? does anyone Know? I htink that people hate out of fear. Fear of change, fear of difference and fear of everything staying exactly the same. Everyone wants what they cant have, unless they dont have anything at all then they want nothing but need everything. But if you have it all you want everything and need nothing. we inven tmore and more things to make life simple, but in turn it just makes everything more difficult. you have money therefore you dont know what its like to be without or if you dont have any money you dont know what its like to have. everyone is unique, we have our own thoughts, thats what makes us who we are. We all like And dislike different things. we all believe in different things, and everyone says they like it that way but as soon as they find out someone is different from them they want to sprint in opposite directions of eachother or they wnat to make eachother like themselves. Everyones perfect. you all say were not because everyone makes mistakes, and thats what makes us perfect. Our differences and mistakes. NoOne is perfect to us because we base our lives on imperfection, therefore noone knows what perfection is. In order to find out who you are you have to experience as much as you possibly can or else your not giving yourself a chance to be happy. thank you for reading this even though i know its really scattered and probably makes no sense to you. i apologize.

"[F17] I really need someone to listen This is a throw-away, because I don't want anyone in my personal life to see this. Let me preface this by saying I've been diagnosed with bipolar tendencies (i guess you can't diagnose bipolar disorder until you're 18), severe depression, chronic anxiety and body dysmorphia. I've been hospitalized for a suicide attempt almost two years ago, and I've struggled with self harm since fourth grade. I was bullied relentlessly throughout elementary and middle school. Thankfully, i've been clean for a year, and after the hospital I got on medication and things started to get better for a while. My senior year has been great so far but it's starting to get bad again. I used to be a social smoker, but now I'm completely dependent on marijuana for everything. I'm not hungry unless I smoke and I can't fall asleep unless I smoke. I need it to get through the day. I can't go to college, because I can't afford it and my mom says she can't consign on a loan for me. I totally understand that too, because if my dad were to die she'd be in trouble and in tens of thousands of dollars in debt. I'm just sad because I want to go away like all of my friends but I can't. My dad is most likely going to lose his job soon apparently too, which is going to put us in poverty. My mom and dad fight all the time, and hate each other. They've both talked about getting a divorce to me exclusively. I pretend like it doesn't bother me, but it does. My dad is addicted to prescription painkillers, and locks himself in his room the minute he gets home. He comes to my choir concerts, plays, and musicals but leaves almost immediately after it starts, which hurts me a lot. I pretend like I don't care about that either. The thing that hurts me the most now is my dog was put down today. She was my first dog. I was allergic to dogs when I was way younger. I grew out of it and it took so long to find her, because my mom was set on picking the perfect dog for us. We found her, and now she's gone. I was the one who stayed in the room with her, because my mom couldn't do it. I pet and comforted her while she died. I've never had to cope with someone dying before, and it's so hard. She was just a dog, but I still loved her so much. I want her back so bad. My problems are so minor compared to some people's, but I'm so sad right now. I don't know what to do. This is the first time in a while that I've wanted to kill myself, but I don't want to go down that road again. I just don't know how to cope anymore.

"I don't even know I don't know if I'm depressed or just the good 'ol sad. I can't fully express how I feel because the inside of my head is a mess.   I don't want to give what I feel everyday the label of ""depression"", I feel like it just insults the people who knows they have depression. I have no idea where to get any help for whatever I feel. If I did, I would either be too lazy or too shy to ask.   I am too lazy. Everything is just too tedious. In everything I do, halfway through it I just feel an intense urge to give up, and I do.

English, something I was proud of for learning it by myself, became harder for me. My memory isn't what it used to be.   I'm jealous of other people who can properly comfort their depressed loved ones. Everytime, it pains me that I can't find anything in my head or say anything to make them feel atleast a little better. It eats me inside that I know they're suffering and I can't make them feel that someone cares when they think that no-one does.

" Question.   What is this blog about? why's it here? who the hell are you? and why do you think that this deserves to take up valuable internet real estate?   well i'll tell you grasshopper. this blog is a test, a personal test. a test designed to push my own boundaries, and maybe...just maybe bring into being something bigger than just another shitty internet blog.  ultimately, this blog will be a place where i can give wings to my voice and throw open the doors that hold back the whirlwind of emotions and thoughts that dance their way through my headspace. ambiguous enough for you?  on a specific note, i am hoping to eventually provide enough detail about my personality and ideas/ideals that at some point in the future my posts can be used to create a simulacrum of myself. some sort of personality that will capture the essence of what I am about. but that's more of a long term goal.  short term this blog will aim to provide myself with a sounding board for my own thoughts and emotions. a place where I can cry out to my imagined readers and tweak my opinions.  the title of the blog 'generation gap' reflects a deep emotional feeling that I have regarding being labeled by society, and falling down into the generation gap [or generation trap]. hopefully my rantings will address this give the site a 'feel' of changing for the better.  so who the hell am i? i am me! i am someone who is searching. someone who is constantly looking, not sure what he will find, but making the most of the journey of discovery. i am someone who is sick to death of the crap passed down to us by society, in an unconscious attempt to mold us and tell us how to be. i am someone who is trying to push my own boundaries to discover my own mettle and shine in whatever way i can. i am me.  as for why this site should exist, well simply put, cause i want it to. it represents an extention of my will into an infinate void [the interent] where there exists plenty of room for everyone to play. so if you run into this site and don't like it... don't read it, don't come back... sorted. this site exists for me, but if someone else benefits from it then fantastic!  next question.

" So, this is the first time I have ever posted something. Been thinking about a lot lately, so this might seem to be pretty random.  Things are changing all around, but I don't really think any of it is really going to make much of a difference. Out with the old, in with the new. New managers to work with at work. New owners to work with at work. Everything is new at work, except for me and what I do. Show up, talk to agents, managers, publicists, local bands, local press, etc. Book shows, promote shows, settle shows. It's almost getting to a point where I feel like I am going through the motions. I don't get as excited as I used to about bands. I'm probably just a lit bit jaded, but I hate booking shows like W.A.S.P., and ICP and all that other crap. At least by booking these shows, I get the resources to book the bands that I like. Just take the good with the bad.  About to be an uncle for the first time. Pretty excited about that, but I'm kind of scared for my sister. I just hope that she and her boyfriend are able to raise the baby together. I think it would crush her if he ends up leaving. I know that it will all work out in the end, but I have a feeling that it might be kind of a rocky road.  Been thinking about life and love a little bit too much lately. I really miss what it's like to be in a relationship with someone. It's been two years now, and I still find myself thinking about the good times I had with Colleen from time to time. It's not that I miss her, I think I just miss the idea of having someone like her to have around. It's nice to be able to see someone everyday and not get sick of them. Someone with whom I can share my thoughts and feelings.  On a similar note, I think it's time that I start taking care of myself a little bit more.

"I wish I was 15 again, when nothing really mattered I'm 21 now and all I want is to be 15 again, when I didn't have any worries,  when I didn't know what depression was, when I had interests, when I didn't have existential crisis, when I didn't question every little thing about myself, I was just able to BE. Not to say everything was perfect back then, but every year it starts feeling emptier and emptier. Even though my life has technically better, I feel so empty and dead.

"Friends? Hi Reddit, so I recently moved to a new town (and by recently I mean about a year ago) and everything has been alright but I have a really hard time making friends. I'm pretty awkward and I'm just naturally awkward around everyone.   I managed to get a best-friend, but its more like he adopted me to be his friend and I got the balls to get a girlfriend who I've been with for about 10 months now. I even got somewhat of a friend group but I'm always awkward around any of them when I'm just with them.   so, what i'm trying to say I guess is that I'm wondering if ya'll could give me advice on how not to be awkward or how to get people to enjoy/embrace my awkwardness. I don't know man, I just want friends lol. Thanks guys &lt;3 ",0,friend hi reddit recently moved new town and recently mean year ago alright really hard time making friend pretty awkward just naturally awkward everyone managed bestfriend like adopted friend got ball girlfriend month now got somewhat friend group awkward just them so trying say guess wondering ya advice not awkward people enjoyembrace awkwardness not know man just want friend lol thanks guy lt
"My life is so hollow Stupid self pitying rant, sorry. Nobody cares about my existence.  I’ve never been and can’t get into a relationship. I’m stuck in this isolated suburb for the next 3 years of my life, drifting between my school and home. Usually I can occupy my mind with focusing on my looks or dreaming of the beautiful life i’m going to have once i’m free, but recently i’ve been having to do more school work (i’m used to just stumbling through school without really focusing and getting above average grades but recently i’ve been having to actually work to compete with my peers) and I either reject it to stay in my dream world or get 10 minutes in and break down because it gives me time to realise how hollow my life is. Nothing feels authentic when i’m here. There have been beautiful times in my life and 90% of them are when i’ve been abroad. I just feel so genuinely empty whenever I give myself chance to look around and realise how isolated I am from people and the world.

" So here I sit at work. Only three more hours left, I guess that's not so bad. It's over time so that makes it even better.    This online Blog idea was very clever. The user interface is very easy to use. I like it.    So when is it too soon to say I love you to someone? Or is there even a time limit on feelings and emotions. I don't think there is. I use to. I use to never believe in love at first sight. But just because you don't believe in something, doesn't mean it's not there. It's amazing how I use to think when someone would say, ""Oh you'll know when you've found the person you want to spend the rest of your life with."" I'd think to myself, how can that possibly be? How can you possibly know that just after meeting someone. Use to think it was all just movie talk, hollywood glamour to sell movies and merchandise. But I believe it now. I think deep down in my heart I had always wanted to believe it, but never wanted to get my hopes up for fear of being let down.    An Ex of mine use to get so aggrivated with me during our break up, cause he kept asking me if I see him in my future. I kept telling him I don't know. Because well, I don't. He kept asking if I had hopes for us to be together again, and I said, No. I don't have hopes for anything. Never have. It's better to have never hoped for anything, then to have been let down by those false hopes. But is it better to have loved and lost, then to have never loved? Going through the break up, I began thinking it's better to have never loved. But in recent events, I couldn't change my mind quick enough. I would rather have loved, and lost. The joy of being with that one person, and sharing moments and experiences that would never be the same, is priceless.    Well there is quite alot there to read. hehe I guess I should probably get some work done.

"I lost my job, i'm in the worst place i have ever been, and nothing makes sense or feels fair. I have worked at the same place for nearly three years. It's an entry level retail job, but i haven't ever had anything else, so it was really the only thing that made me feel validated. Recently, for the fifth time i got passed up for a promotion, but this time marked the end. The girl who got promoted over me is one of my best friends in the world. She is absolutely amazing, and i am so happy for her, but it was the hardest to accept. She started about a year ago, and i helped train her and build her up. Fairly quickly, we became the face of the job that we did. She was my partner in everything, and i feel like i would be there for the things she couldn't do, and she would be there for the things i couldn't do. Seeing her success is the most proud i have ever been, but it's made me the most miserable. I basically found out that after busting my ass for over two years, my partner was going to be my boss. I hate that. I lost the person that was my rock in the things that i did. I don't want to work under her, i wanted to be there with her. She told me when it happened out of respect for me, and i turned in my resignation the next day. Now the only thing that made me feel validated and gave me security is gone, and i don't know what to do.   My friend understood everything of course. More than just being my partner in work, she was the only person who could tell when things got really bad for me. When i hide how miserable i am, she's the first person to notice, and the only person who understands and will tell me what i need to hear. If there is any upside to all of this, it's that at least i still have my friend. In my overthinking and fear, i guess i was afraid this would change things. I learned pretty fast how much care and respect she holds for me, and i don't think anything will change that. I hope not.  This job was beating me down. I trained a lot of our best staff, and i had a lot of associate come to me before management, feeling like i was more of a leader to them than our actual leadership was. We lost a lot of people due to burnout and frustration with management, but i know that i always cared about the people i got to train and help, and took a lot of pride in their success. Even after getting underpaid, undervalued, and shafted at every turn, i always stayed because i cared about the people i worked with and i wouldn't give up on them. One would think that leaving a shit situation would make me happy, but it just doesn't. Despite my 2+ years retail and leadership experience, it's been hard to find another job. Most people offer me less money than i made before (not much) and basically completely ignore any qualifications i actually have.   I am in school. I finish community college this year and will move to a four year school assuming i can as my performance isn't amazing. I I want to pursue grad school to gain qualifications as an industrial/org psychologist, but everything seems so far away. I feel like with being a Psych major i'm just going to end up equally as useless with a four year degree, and even if grad school does work out, that's overall another four years from now. I have to pay bills, and i hate feeling so useless.   I'm not going to starve and die or anything. My family has money, and has offered to help me pay bills if i can't find a job, but that just makes things worse in a way. I moved away from home because i wanted to be my own person. It has been three years and i haven't had to ask for help from anybody. I hate the thought that i will have to rely on these people who have given me everything to give me more. It isn't their fault that i'm a fuck up.  A man said to the universe:   “Sir, I exist!”  “However,” replied the universe,   “The fact has not created in me  A sense of obligation.”    - Stephen Crane  I know that life isn't fair. I know nobody owes me anything, but i hate that it seems like i always end up last. My friend gets to be happy, my other friend practically runs the store now (but not enough to help, because the SM makes all the decisions and she's shitty), but i have the least and i get the least. My staff and coworkers get people to hang out with. Everyone gets to go home to someone that loves them when they fail and gets comfort from that. I don't get that. I am alone, and i have always been. The joy i get is from making other people happy because i can't make myself happy. I want to make these people never have to feel how i do. It's just so fucking unfair that things just seem to work out better for everyone else. I don't know what to do, i don't know where to go, and i don't know how to be happy.  This is the worst it has been. Usually i go home for a bit to take my mind off things, or can occupy my time with videos games or something to take my mind off things. Nothing is fun right now. Not turning to alcohol is hard. I really feel like things will get better but..... how fucking long does it take? What do i do until then?",1,lost job worst place been make sense feel fair worked place nearly year entry level retail job not else really thing feel validated recently fifth time got passed promotion time marked end girl got promoted best friend world absolutely amazing happy her hardest accept started year ago helped train build up fairly quickly face job did partner everything feel like thing not do thing not do seeing success proud been miserable basically busting as year partner going bos hate that lost person rock thing did not want work her wanted her told happened respect me turned resignation day thing feel validated gave security gone not know do friend understood course just partner work person tell thing got really bad me hide miserable am person notice person understands tell need hear upside this friend overthinking fear guess afraid change thing learned pretty fast care respect hold me not think change that hope not job beating down trained lot best staff lot associate come management feeling like leader actual leadership wa lost lot people burnout frustration management know cared people got train help took lot pride success getting underpaid undervalued shafted turn stayed cared people worked not them think leaving shit situation make happy just doe not despite year retail leadership experience hard job people offer money not much basically completely ignore qualification actually have school finish community college year year school assuming performance not amazing want pursue grad school gain qualification industrialorg psychologist far away feel like psych major just going end equally useless year degree grad school doe work out overall year now pay bill hate feeling useless not going starve die anything family money offered help pay bill job just make thing worse way moved away home wanted person year not ask help anybody hate thought rely people given more not fault fuck up man said universe sir exist however replied universe fact not created sense obligation stephen crane know life not fair know owes anything hate like end last friend get happy friend practically run store but not help sm make decision shitty least staff coworkers people hang with get home love fail get comfort that not that alone been joy making people happy make happy want make people feel do just fucking unfair thing just work better else not know do not know go not know happy worst been usually home bit mind thing occupy time video game mind thing fun right now not turning alcohol hard really feel like thing better but fucking long doe take then

"In an awkward situation with my best friend. She wants me to tell how I feel towards her - how should I? I’ve been friends with her for 3 years. She’s a lovely person and I really like her, but there were some occasions where I felt weird around her.   She apparently sensed it and recently asked me what’s wrong between us, telling I should tell her if there’s something.   Some of the things I’m thinking of telling her are:  - she often kind of invites herself when she learns I hang out with my friends and invites other people (that I don’t know well) as well without asking me when I organise something (picnic, trip etc.)   - she’s a nice person and means well, but she sometimes says things that hurt my feelings. For example, she said she couldn’t wait to move into a new flat with her bf or how he’s like in bed when I was having a difficult time after a breakup, and she often assumes I’m broke and I feel sort of belittled.   - she tells my rather personal stuff to her other friends, like gossip  I could list several things, but I’m not sure if I should be upfront, as she has social anxieties and I don’t want her to feel bad or scared in social situations. Or are there nicer ways to put them?   Also, I should probably mention that I have a small circle of friends, and she’s basically been my only friend that I get to see regularly, I’ve been really good friends with a girl (B) that I met partly through her for the past few months. I enjoy hanging out with her (A), and we text each other all the time, but I’m not sure how she (A) feels about this.  Thanks for taking your time to read this, I appreciate it.

"I just drove 1000 miles cause my Gma tried to OD and is in ICU. IDK if this belongs here. Maybe it will get removed, but I feel like I need to vent somewhere. My grandma has struggled with manic depression a lot through her life. I've always seen her as this strong independent woman. She has always been my favorite family member because just how kind and loving she is toward everyone and everything.  No matter how bad life has ever gotten for me or anyone else she has always had positive words. Well I never knew it but she's a bottler and my dad told me in the 90s she snapped and try to OD roughly 20 years ago. Combination with anxiety and stress and lots of other factors. Keep in mind everyone loves this woman she has 3 granddaughters and 1 grandson and loving kids. This woman is a saint in my family. He we are 20 years later again. My family and I live in Texas, meanwhile they live in Georgia and my dads sister/ gmas daughter and her family live in Virgina. My aunt plans to move back to TX. So my grandparents were planning to move to TX since everyone on the East Coast is leaving. When it came down to sign on a Realtor she snapped I guess again.... These are people in there 70s trying to uproot their life again and move across country. She tried to OD on some pills and my dad, sister, and I hopped in the car yesterday and drove from Tx to Ga. My Gpa said he noticed she was eating less but didn't see the signs. Now we surprised her and didn't tell her we were coming. Amongst other family all were happy to see us. My Gma I could tell wasn't the rock solid woman I always known her to be. It made me realize that you can be 70yo and still have these dark thoughts and try. She looked so weak and frail. So here I am in a different time zone trying to support my gma the best I can. My sister doesn't even know, she just thinks she's 'sick'. This woman has all the love in the world and that still doesn't help dark thoughts. IDK how I feel, I don't know how I'm coping. It hasn't hit me yet I think... Also my Gpa literally would not survive without her. Like she's the one that makes sure bills are paid on time and basically runs the house. She's his guide and he'd be lost and a wreck without her. Hes so shaken up and worried. On top of everything my girlfriend just tried the same thing but a different method and her brother called the cops and she got 5150'd and I've talked her once in 3 days. When she called I had just learned about my gma and I feel like she didn't get the support she needed from me. It breaks my soul to think that this loving amazing person would want it to go all away and leave all of us behind. I have so many cherished memories of my grandparents. Sometimes I feel like I can get these stints of depression and I know it runs in the family.

" Well, yesterday I went to warped tour with my gay and lesbian friends from Kiel. I have to say that it was a rocking time. I got to see Story of the Year, which blew my fucking ass away. The pure energy that just flowed off of the stage and into every soul jamming at the concert was so intense. I really didn't expect much from the other bands that I saw, basically because I knew nothing of their musical endeavors. But I would have to say that Flogging Molly and Billy Talent really left a good impression on me. So good in fact that I decieded to download their music. Illegaly of course. It was the only way I could really show my appreciation towards them. Other than not being able to hear for most of the day, it went by pretty typical. Went to the farm for a while in the morning, came home, played a little Metroid on the JNES, and reffed a meaningless soccer game. Oh, and I created this incredibly awesome web blog. Yea, that's it.

" They say when it rains it pours and boy are they right.  Things that have happend to me this month-- graduation, birthday, mother's day, breakdown of both vehicles at the worst possible time, frustrating treading of water re the fixing of the lawnmower, which means my grass is waist high now.  Then He Who Is Mine went and tore his bicep off the bone-- surgery to reattach it was just Thursday.  Now he's on a forced three month medical leave, crippled up and unable to do anything with his arm in a splint, *and* because his injury happened at home, he's not eligible for light duty at work, therefore he's out of luck on the paycheck department.  So.  I've put in my app in several places the last few days and told the boss to expect a phone call or three but please don't think I'm leaving (are you kidding? This job is manna from heaven).  I also spent the day (and half the night) futzing around with an old computer trying to get it ready so my MIL can use it at work. In the process, I have made it so that DH's compter... the one with EQ installed mind you... won't even boot.  I will have to spend a week futzing around with that one too to figure out why.

We had only been dating for 3 months. Sad huh. This went on sporadically for about a year and a half (during that time I committed myself). Finally I started dating my next boyfriend. He told me if I didn't stop cutting he would leave me. I stopped. We dated 2 years and then broke up. I am now 27 and married to another man who is 12 years older than me. We have been married almost a year (together for 3.5 years) and about 3 months ago I started cutting again. This time it is 3 times worse and I can't seem to stop. I am covered in scars and I have even gone as far as cutting the inside of my wrist. I am currently on Wellbutrin which does seem to be working (I do have a lot of good days). Although since I started to become depressed again I have been having a hard time dealing with the fact that my husband has a son. It didn't bother me as much (just a little) before because I did my best to stay busy. Since I got married I lost all my friends and now spend every other weekend alone. Mostly in bed. I never had to play mom before so I never thought I would ever be in the position to, so I just stayed out of the way. Plus, his son doesn't like me being around. Which makes me feel worse. In my state of mind I can't deal with that. My alone time is when I cut the most. My husband and I are in therapy, my therapist wants us to work. I am not so sure I can stay with him. Although I am having a hard time leaving. I am just so tired of feeling so alone all the time and he is just not capable of being there for me. This puts extra stress on him and I don't want that. Plus, it is my fault I married him, I knew he had a kid. I guess I didn't know I would get bad again. Last week we talked about me leaving. He ran upstairs and cried (he said he will fight for me) I went straight for the exacto knife. I had suicide in mind although I see myself as a wimp in that area which makes me feel even worse about myself. I cut 5 times on the inside of my wrist but I guess not deep enough. He came down and found me. My antidepressants work almost 80% of the time but whenever I think of losing my husband I get sad and hopeless. Every time I think of staying with him and feeling the way I do all the time I get sad and hopeless. I feel cornered. Cutting make it all feel better, suicide sounds comforting.

"Im wasting my life As a 15 year old currently, I feel like i'm entirely disconnected from every human soul on this planet. I cannot properly have social interactions with others without me overthinking stuff that person says. What I mean is, if a ""friend"" tells me i'm dumb jokingly, I take it at heart. I take everything too literal, I cannot properly talk to others without me being awkward and silent. I cannot talk to people if I have ignore them constantly, if someone addresses me so they can talk to me, I sometimes ignore them and pretend like I never heard them. If a person says hi to me, I stay silent. I'll never get a girlfriend, i'll never feel a girls hand, or the feeling of affection, comfort, and attention. I never even got to talk to a girl before. Seeing everyone at school socializing with their girlfriend, hugging them, doing everything for them, absolutely destroys me as a person. I can see why I got bullied. Those times I was called ""Pussy"" ""Weak"" ""Retarded"" turned out to be true. The physical bullying I received, when they pulled my hair and embarrassed me in front of everyone in class by flipping me off my chair. I understand now, the stuff I deserve. I can see why my dad abondoned me ever since I was born, he was never there for me, I don't know what type of man he is or how he looks like. The brothers and sisters I never met, which I dearly wish I could. They're all so young, I wish I could have been a big brother for them. I hate living in isolation and loneliness. As if I wasn't lonely enough at school, but now at home. Everyone takes their brothers and sisters for granted, but a person like me would love one of those. My grandparents and mom say they love me, which I do believe, but I still feel no more or less that same, it doesn't matter in the end. I cannot do simple activities at school that involve groups, no because a person could possibly screw it up for us, but because I need to socialize. I cannot do sports because it involves me being around people and I absolutely despise it. What am I so afraid of? Being judged? Why am I here? What am I? It doesn't matter, I still die in the end anyways. Maybe taking my own life is the answer, it resolves all the pain I have received. Who cares what my so called family feels? They must know its for my own personal benefit, they should realize that when I do eventually end myself, that I will no longer feel the pain I once received. I never have felt an emotional connection between any of my family, they're doing their own thing in their life. Nobody at school would care, I only have two friends. Ones I hold dear because they understand my pain. Looks are deceiving aren't they? A lot of people in my school consider me attractive and cute, but good does that do me? I won't get any benefit from it either way.  A bit of a description of how I look like, long hair, feminine face, a thin appearance (not super thin, I weigh about 130). But anyways, I simply plan on ending my own life sooner or later, I don't know how long I can last. We have no value, no significant purpose of existing, so might as well end it now. I constantly wear this mask where i pretend i'm happy, when i'm not.  The only thing I do with my life is listen to Joy of Mans Desiring in bed, contemplating my existence.",1,im wasting life year old currently feel like entirely disconnected human soul planet properly social interaction overthinking stuff person say mean is friend tell dumb jokingly heart literal properly talk awkward silent talk people ignore constantly address talk me ignore pretend like heard them person say hi me stay silent girlfriend feel girl hand feeling affection comfort attention got talk girl before seeing school socializing girlfriend hugging them doing them absolutely destroys person got bullied time called pussy weak retarded turned true physical bullying received pulled hair embarrassed class flipping chair understand now stuff deserve dad abondoned born me not know type man look like brother sister met dearly wish could young wish big brother them hate living isolation loneliness not lonely school home take brother sister granted person like love those grandparent mom say love me believe feel same doe not matter end simple activity school involve group person possibly screw u need socialize sport involves people absolutely despise it afraid of judged here i doe not matter die end anyways maybe taking life answer resolve pain received care called family feel know personal benefit realize eventually end myself longer feel pain received felt emotional connection family doing thing life school care friend one hold dear understand pain look deceiving not they lot people school consider attractive cute good doe me not benefit way bit description look like long hair feminine face appearance not super thin weigh anyways simply plan ending life sooner later not know long last value significant purpose existing end now constantly wear mask pretend happy not thing life listen joy man desiring bed contemplating existence

"Depressed? Or Just in a Bad Rut? (Long Post) I've never really felt like I've had depression before. I'm turning 24 at the end of the week, and this is the first time I've honestly wondered about myself. Usually, I'm pretty happy about things, and my outlook on life has always been realistically positive. But, lately, I just feel absolutely lost. And this morning, after I got off of work, I sat and cried. I'm not much of crier at all, and the only other time I've cried in the last ten years has been at an uncle's funeral recently.   This past summer, for me, was a pretty great time. I was in a relationship with a girl who really made me happy, more than any other one had before. I seemed to be having fun every weekend, whether with her or with some friends of mine or family. I had a lot on the horizon, and a lot to look forward to. I was getting ready to finish up my degree, and it seemed like things were going in the right direction. The only thing that was a problem then was that my job was a third shift job, but it was 3 days a week, and usually 11-13 hour shifts, meaning I had time to do stuff outside of it. But, my then girlfriend and another friend had solid connections that they thought could help me land a much better job where they worked, which would carry me pretty well until I finished school. Things were looking up for me. I was pretty happy.   I guess things started to slip for me when my uncle got hit with a terminal diagnosis in August. At 47, and with young children, nobody in the family was prepared to lose him. And the disease, an incredibly rare degenerative brain disease, was the same one that killed my grandmother 11 years ago. We lost him in early September. The thing with this disease that nobody in the family is talking about is that, if it hits twice within the same bloodline, there's a 50% chance that living relatives within the bloodline will get it in their 40's or 50's. There's nine of us left in the immediate family, including my mother, my brother and myself. And since it's so rare, there is absolutely no treatment plan.   That, for me, was a lot to process. I'm not worried about myself, but the idea that I could still be losing relatives to this disease for years sucks. It's hard enough seeing it happen twice.   During this time, things started to fall apart with me and my then-girlfriend as well. I kind of hid out with her for a while, because my family was perpetually sad and in a state of distress. And since I worked nights, I was kind of isolated. Things started to hit a rut between me and her when she started her own treatment for depression. I tried to be supportive of her, while doing whatever anyone in my family needed while my uncle was sick. She really seemed happy that I was there for her, (and things really worked out since she lived so close to my uncle anyways, and I could bounce back and forth from place to place on my days off.)  Both my family and my girlfriend were very important to me, and I guess helping them out made me feel good about myself, even though the situation was shitty. I kind of let school fall to the back-burner though. And I kind of neglected my other friends for a while as well. But between work, my family, and her, I was consistently busy.   My uncle passed in early September, sending most of my family into a pretty bad state, and only a week later, my girlfriend decided she was done with me, because she was afraid that if she recovered from her depression with me around, then she'd equate me with happiness, and if I left her then she wouldn't be able to recover. (Which ended up being mostly a made up way of saying, I don't love you anymore, but I don't have the courage to tell you.) Obviously, it wasn't fair to her to be stuck with me if she wasn't happy with me, but there were so many better opportunities for her to break things off, and she chose the one that was the most tedious and mentally draining for me. My state of mind after it ended wasn't great at all, and I said some very mean things to her after it ended, (I guess, at the time, I thought it was constructive criticism, but it was all just mean and awful and embarrassing.) Understandably, she hasn't talked to me since, and I feel like I burned any bridge towards reconciling with her.  I missed my uncle a lot, but doing favors for his wife and kids helped me at least feel like I was contributing. My mother's still kind of a mess about it, but she has my father for support. My brother had a hard time for a while too, but his job keeps him well occupied. But, lately, for me, the things I can help with anymore have been fewer and fewer.   Right now, I just want to fast forward to like March or April. I don't want to deal with my birthday, since the plans I had with my ex-girlfriend are obviously not happening anymore, most of my friends are busy with work and school, and my family is still not back to being normal. Nobody seems to want to do much for my birthday anyways, which is, for lack of a better word, normal for me. When I got home from work this morning, I cried thinking about it all. I've never had that kind of emotional reaction to anything before.   The only thing I look forward to in life at the moment is my night or two out with a friend a week. The holidays are going to be rough on my family, I know now that my ex girlfriend (who I still care for and would probably take back) has completely moved on from me, and the once promising prospect of a new job isn't nearly as likely as it used to be. And, school kind of got caught up in the shuffle, and I'm not where I wanted to be with that, either. I'm going to be out on my own come January, which might help, but right now I'm just dreading the next month. I feel like the things I care about are slipping further and further out of my control, and it's hard for me to deal with.  I don't know if this is just a rough patch in my life, or a sign that I have a more serious problem. But right now, I have very few people that I can be 100% open with, and it's been tough. Work is, for lack of a better word, quiet for me, meaning I spend most of my time thinking, and it doesn't help much. Since I've never really had a stretch like this before where I've been as mentally drained and just sad, I'm not really sure what to do. But there's very little on the horizon that I'm looking forward to, and I'm worried about that.   tl;dr: Stretch of life events, most of which out of my control, have wreaked havoc on my emotional state. I now feel kind of hopeless. Don't know if it's just a rough patch in life, or something worse.

"Lonely, family/friends just not interested?? We moved across the country almost a year ago. We left all our extended family behind, which was hard because we were really close to them. But, It was a great opportunity for us. We are doing really well as a family unit, with life, jobs, and everything other than missing our family.  Now, I'm getting really lonely, and can't seem to get any of my in laws or friends to come visit, even the ones with no jobs, kids, whatever. Tried offering to pay for the airfare. I set up a fully furnished guest room, and offered it up. I have kept in touch with everyone on a weekly or bi-weekly basis on the phone this whole time, as well as every couple of days on social media.   We were all so close before, but since we moved, it feels like everyone just wants to forget we existed. Is it time to just stop trying?

"We have been playing Quake 4 almost every night for a little while. We play online against other players using Xbox Live and it is very cool. Most people are friendly. We have made some 'friends' and we find them and play with them. One time I found some person talking too much trash and you can go in a mute them or set a preference to never see them again. Well, last night I encountered a group who had a feud going. One kid was talking too much trash and people on the other side were just going with it. I figured one game was a not a big deal. But sometimes you end up finding them again and again in the same night. I have this guy some slack and didn't say anything but then later I got to play as part of the same team with him. What a jerk. He kept asking me to give him the flag so he score it and get the points instead of me. Forget about the team winning, this guy wanted all the points for himself and didn't care about the team. I had to set him straight, and after the game I had to report him as being a trash player and set in my preferences to never see him again. After that I saw the other players and they were all nice. It only takes one guy to ruin a great experience. Overall, playing online with all these people and talking with them is great, you just have to know when to cut someone loose. Eventually when many people report him as being a jerk, he will be banned from the game. Oh well.",1,playing quake night little while play online player using xbox live cool people friendly friend play them time person talking trash mute set preference again well night encountered group feud going kid talking trash people just going it figured game not big deal end finding night guy slack did not say later got play team him jerk kept asking flag score point instead me forget team winning guy wanted point did not care team set straight game report trash player set preference again saw player nice take guy ruin great experience overall playing online people talking great just know cut loose eventually people report jerk banned game oh well

So I jumped out of bed and opened my door, and this WALL of smoke came pouring in! I quickly woke up my brothers and got them outside, then went back in to investigate. I hurried over to our kitchen, and arrived just in time to see out microwave melt and fall into pieces!!

Today though I decided to go to subway to get a melt and I was just standing in line when this girl walks away from her friend and up to me. I thought she was pretty and was nervous about why she was talking to me until she asked “Are you a serial killer?”  That’s when my heart sank.   I had just shaved and I realize I’m not the best looking guy in the world, but I didn’t know that’s how strangers perceived me. I kept a calm demeanor until I got back to my car and I just complete broke down and I was bawling all the way home.  I don’t know why it hurt so much, but I felt like complete shit.   I’m trying to not let it affect me and not hit a low point so I hope sharing this relieves me a little bit. I am nervous about sharing this though. I’m just shocked that someone could say that.   Sorry for the formatting I’m on mobile. I don’t know if this is the right sub for this either, I just needed to get this off my chest.

"There truly is no hope. For any of us. This is the bleakest truth of all. Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born.   But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but it doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved.   And the truth is I feel so angry, and the truth is I feel so fucking sad, and the truth is I've felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long I've been pretending I'm OK, just to get along, just for, I don't know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own.

"Any advice on how to handle leaving my only friend? LAST thing I need right now is the pain but I think I have to. I've posted here a few times before and never got much for replies, which is ok.  I really do hope I can get some insight on this particular issue however.  For so long I've been completely alone and it really sucked.  I managed to connect with my Cousin a couple of years ago and we've had a lot of great times, but more often than not lately it seems I feel bad after dropping her off instead of good that we hung out.    We've hung out like 3 times a week for a couple years now.  I feel like we have a real connection but she doesn't show it if she feels the same.    I'm an alcoholic and so is she, so we drink together a lot.  I certainly would be able to quit if I didn't have to drink to be around her.  Besides the booze I have no idea what other drugs she's into; I know coke for sure, probably smoking crack time to time, she's made jokes about wanting to go out and do meth all night.    She's CONSTANTLY lying to me about everything.   She is so very unreliable, in the last 2 weeks twice now she's made plans with me for the next day, only to show up on facebook at like 8pm after I've been sitting and waiting for her all day and then she gets angry with me for telling her it makes me feel like shit.    Everything is always about her, she's even more depressed than me and has none of the coping skills I do so most of the time it's just her bringing up all her problems and me trying to reassure her.  If I try to talk about my issues though she pays no attention and changes the subject.    I know she's not really a ""friend"" more of a ""company prostitute"" if anything, it seems like I'm always having to buy the booze or lend her money she never pays back.  I know I am being blatantly used, but the company is still better than being alone with my thoughts all of the time.    She actually ""ghosted"" me about a year ago for a few months and that put me in a really bad place, I had to check into the psych ward I was in such a rut over it.  When we finally started hanging out again she didn't seem to care at all the pain it caused me, and I still have never heard an answer ""why"" she'd block me and dodge my calls or visits out of the blue.    I feel like she's getting worse and no matter how hard I try I can't help her or make her seem to care.    I don't think I can handle the pain of losing my ""friend"" again.  I also have OCD and I obsess on things to ridiculous lengths and this is going to suck me into a dark hole for a long time.    I suppose I actually came here hoping people would tell me not to ditch her, but I know I can't keep letting her treat me like this.     How do I do it on good terms?   How do I get over it and not let the grief consume me?

"Anyone else feel they are unloveable? TLDR: I feel I have no friends and anybody I get close to leaves   I started noticing I was always unhappy and sad in my last year of high school. I didn’t understand the point of life anymore and everyday driving to school I just thought how easy it was to drive off a cliff on the way to school. I got scared and told my parents who helped me get professional help. I confided in my 3 best friends at the time and almost immediately I noticed 2 of them stopped talking to me. The third I’m still friends with but not nearly as close as I used to be.   When I went to college, my roommate and I became best friends but a year later, he decided to drop out and leave. I realize this is through no fault of my own but it still sucks losing a best friend.   Finally, my 3rd year of college, I met the most amazing woman. With her help, I felt like I finally defeated depression. We dated for 2 years and I was so sure we were gonna last. However, I got a job on the east coast whereas we were both from the west coast. We decided we could last through the distance so I took the job and moved 3000 miles away. She just told me it wasn’t working out and broke up with me.   She was my best friend and my girlfriend for 2 years. I never felt a connection with anyone else as strong as I did for her. Now I’m fearing my depression may have come back. I’m thinking I didn’t defeat depression but instead had her to use as a support. I’m here on the east coast of the US and I have no friends or family around me. I don’t know what to do and everyday I just feel like it’s me vs the whole world. I’ve already lost all hope and I feel like I don’t deserve happiness. Why else would happiness be ripped from me every time I feel like I found it.

"Feeling sad for my daughter/realizing grandparents won't live forever My husband and I had a child later in life. She's 18 months old and her grandparents on both sides are in their mid-late 60's. My parents are very healthy and I don't think of them as ""old"", so I mentioned that my daughter could live close to them if she chose to go to University in the city where they live. My mom chimed up and said that they may both be dead by then (for context, they're Chinese and it's completely normal for them to be this blunt with their children).   I've had other family members pass away before, but it just hit me that no matter how you prepare yourself for that day, you'll never be ready to say goodbye. It's never enough time.  I immediately felt very sad for my young daughter and just hope that we have lots of time left to bond and make memories. We live 5 hours away by car, so it's hard to see them as regularly as we'd like, but we try to visit and have them visit as often as we can.

"Gossiping in the family Hello. I am not sure whether this fits in this sub but I am going to ask it anyway. My family is a known gossiper. All of them tend to gossip about me. I am the odd ball, the one who doesn't agree with them. The one they all tend to chat about. Many times we have arguments, they all gain up on me. I will have my mom, dad, and older sisters all attacking my character- telling me I am no good and that I am poison . I have caught them in a few instances; but they brush it off. Often, they pretend I am being paranoid or they play dumb and be like, ""I did nothing, we said nothing."" Sometimes they complain about someone else to use it to get to me. It's really bothersome. It makes me feel so betrayed, confused, and really angered. I also not my family learns things about me before I even told them- mainly negative. There are lists of inconsistent gaps. I try to confront them but they immediately dismiss me. They try to cover up their tracks and always tell me I am paranoid. I know lots of the advice will be to confront them, but I do not believe that will work. I have tried that- all kinds of approaches but they insist they did nothing even when I catch them saying things about me. My mother does it the most. Often she, gossips after work with my sisters or sometimes with my dad. Sometimes my sisters gossip about me together. I have become the play thing in the family- my problems and life is just a giant joke they can share their contempt for. It's hurts. It's hard not to give a shot because it's your own family. I have considered audio recording secretly but that is creepy and invades their privacy despite they do that with me often. It's also wrong to play the same game. What should I do? I really am at a loss.

"Here's a new update for interested readers. Bad news first: I got a voicemail last week, it said my mother was in the hospital. It took me awhile to get more info, I called and left a message where she lived because it was too late to get anyone on the phone there. I finally found out where she was and called the hospital. They said she was having problems walking, that maybe she hurt her back. That she was getting breathing treatments because she had trouble breathing. Part of it was she couldn't smoke, part of it was probably because she does smoke. They didn't seem to find out what caused the problem with her legs. Then she had some other stuff wrong. Part of the good news was one thing they thought was wrong was caused by a shot they gave her, and it was solved the next day. Now, I called her Friday and she said her heart test showed a tear in a valve. She is getting a more detailed test next week, the doctor said it is too early to tell how serious it is or if it needs anything done to it. He told her, it could be just something minor that needs to be monitored and could cause no problems at all or it could require heart surgery. So I was very worried about that. My first thought when I heard she was in the hospital was that she would end up having cancer from smoking, or liver disease from drinking. But I didn't think of any heart problems. I am hoping that it won't be anything serious, or that if she needs surgery that it will be successful and she will recover without any complications. I don't know much about heart surgery, I know I've heart that many bypass patients have good surgery but get sick and die from complications after the surgery. I hope and pray that she will be ok, I live far from her and can't do anything but call her and pray. Now some good news, my new job is going to switch me to fulltime hours next week. I still have to find out if it will be temporary or long-term, but I'm happy either way. I went from poor and going to be homeless, to having a place to live and a low-stress job in a short time. Each day I wake up and am alive and have a place to live means a lot to me now. It kind of gives me a better perspective on life in a way. I know so many people have it worse, so much suffering in the world and I'm lucky. I have to get some new clothes because changing to fulltime I have to go by a different dress code, so I'll be looking for cheap nice clothes tomorrow. I'm thankful I have some money to look for clothes. I'm still adjusting to things, sometimes I feel like ""where am I, what's going on?"" but it is better than before when I was at my apartment thinking ""when will I get kicked out, where will I live?"" I'm trying to take it one step at a time, not worry about where I'm supposed to be going in life. I'm thinking, what do I need, get things stable, be able to support yourself, get a phone, get car insurance, get more hours at work etc... I try to stay positive and be grateful, but still I'm a little lost. If anyone wants more details about things, or advice on how I've coped with anything just leave a reply and I'll answer you. I have a lot of things I've learned and advice, but I don't go around telling people what to do or pushing my point of view.

" Well, I made it to graduation....sort of...After slipping by math with the scholarly final grade of a D minus, I acted like Chris Farley in the begginning of Tommy Boy and felt that it was neccesary to brag about my accomplishments to every man,woman and child within a mile radius. Well, not really, but I did call most of my close friends and family. (If you're reading this and wondering why I didn't call you...get over it.) Commencement went well, except for the part where I got the case with no diploma inside!:) The weekend was great, except for when I found out that I had to change my living arrangments because of someone backing out of a contract. I won't name names, but his initials are Tim Taylor.. (No hard feelings Tim :))Only four more weeks of college, and then I'll become as close to democrat as possible so that I can freeload off of society and milk the government for all it's worth until I finally land a job. At this point, any chance of actually landing a journalism job seems about as realistic as bumping into Tom Hanks at Merritt Square Mall. (I'd say more like...one in a million.'- 'So you're telling me there's a chance!'- Dumb & Dumber) Speaking of Merritt Square, the new theater there is amazing. As my good bud Stacey said, the theater's motto should be: Cobb 16- ""Can you believe you're in Merritt Island?"".

"Beautifully Broken I’ve spent most of my life afraid to be my true self because I believed that if I didn’t live up to the standards and norms that I grew up with, I wouldn’t be accepted. I was told since a young age how I should act, talk, and dress. I was told that money was important and that attending societal events and bullshit balls was your key to social success. And those things, trying to “feel” important, had meant everything to me.  But then life screws you over and suddenly your perspective on everything changes. I learned that I no longer wanted to be the person that everyone said I had to be and things that had once seemed important became trivial. I realized that I didn’t give a fuck if I had Tory Burch shoes or a Chanel bag. No amount of money could ever bring me happiness, which was clearly evident in the money that was spent on “I’m sorry” shopping trips and my therapist.  Things started falling apart at home when I was 15 years old. So my remedy to broken family was to drink until I couldn’t feel. But despite my new fond love of alcohol and its pain killing effects, I kept my life together. I worked hard in school, I stayed active in my community, and I made sure people thought I was keeping it together. I couldn’t let everyone know that I was a fucking mess. But in this process, I slowly lost myself and started living two different lives. When the curtains were wide open, people saw a girl that was very studious, had many accomplishment’s, and always had a smile on her face. But as soon as the curtains closed and I was alone, my demons came out. And the more I hid, the more I lost myself.  At one point, the alcohol wasn’t enough. Things had only gotten worse at home and I needed a new escape. The first time I did it, it was a pair of scissors. It was small, barely noticeable. I had sworn after the first time that I would never hurt myself again. But eventually I did, and when I left for college it had only gotten worse.  By my second year of college, I had reached my lowest point. I was in a toxic, emotionally abusive, relationship. I had a broken relationship with my parents, who spent most of their time stuck in a cycle of fighting, not speaking, and then pretending that they were okay. I hadn’t spoken to my older brother, a struggling addict at the time, in almost a year. I no longer knew who I was. So one night I went out and bought a bottle of wine with my fake ID and went back to my apartment and chugged the entire thing. I sat on my bathroom floor crying, staring at the knife in my hand. And in the back of my mind I thought about the gun that was a few feet away from me hidden in a book that my dad had given me for protection. For the first time in my life, I had looked at mortality straight in the face. I had questioned it many times, but it was never like that night.  Eventually the crying stopped and the numbness came, a feeling I had become all too familiar with.  Would I do it?  Could I do it?  Would anyone care?  I was consumed with darkness, but there was a small flicker of light, of hope. I wanted to help people, I wanted to one day to change the world, or at the very least change one person’s life. I wasn’t ready to leave just yet, so I held on to the tiny amount of hope that was left in me. I called the cops and was admitted into a psychiatric center. I spent 48 hours in a white walled, emotionless, prison like place. And not once did someone ask me if I was okay.  My parents came up to see me and had a difficult time accepting what had happened and I didn’t understand why. They knew I wanted help, they saw the scars on my arms, and they knew that I wasn’t okay.  They blamed my relationship with my then boyfriend and told me to never speak of this to anyone. They didn’t want people to know I was “crazy”. Was I? During that time, I came to believe I was, but now I understand that I was just broken.  It’s been over three years since that happened and although I still struggled with a lot after that, I’m now in a better place.  The reason I am writing this is because I promised myself to one day help the 15-year-old me whose cries for help where tossed to the side, who was told she was over-dramatic and crazy, and who thought that cutting was the only way to cope. There was a reason I grew up surrounded by mental illness. I watched not only myself go through it, but I saw my brother, my parents, my friends, and so many people on the news struggling with their own demons. And this didn’t happen because life felt like fucking me over, it was just trying to show me what my reason for living is.  I spent years ashamed of the person I was because I was scared to show people my true, raw, fucked up self. But isn’t that the problem? When it comes to having a mental illness, we believe the stigmas that come attached to it and we’re afraid to speak up and talk about it. And the people who are lucky enough to not experience it, don’t want to talk about it either. The only difference from how mental illness was treated a hundred years ago and now, is that we no longer hide and chain our family members in basements or attics, but the shame and embarrassment is still there.  And I want to change that. I want to remove the stigmas and stereotypes attached to mental illness and get people talking. But change starts with me, and that means that I can’t be afraid to share my experiences.  This is who I am and I wouldn’t change my life for anything in the world because now I truly understand what it’s like to live with a mental illness. I finally know what the difference between sympathy and empathy is, and that is one of the greatest gifts that could have come out from this.  I will be exploring different topics on mental illness while trying to find ways to change the way people think and talk about it. I will not only be looking at the psychological background of mental illness, but the neurological background as well. More and more scientists are publishing articles on different alternative treatments that don’t involve medications. One of my favorite topics, which I will soon explore in more detail, is neuroplasticity, or the brains way of re-wiring itself to create new circuits, and essentially a new you. I’ve set a goal to one day create a facility for those who are afflicted with a mental illness. But instead of white walls, cold stares from employees, and isolation, they will be surrounded by beautiful colors, the outdoors, and people who actually care.  Our current mental health system is completely and utterly fucked up. We can’t keep over-medicating people and throwing them out into the world with absolutely no regard for their actual well-being. If these “treatments” were actually working, we wouldn’t be seeing an alarmingly increasing rate of mental illness.  It’s time to re-define mental illness and stick a middle finger up to all the people who tell you that you’re crazy or different.  And maybe I am crazy, I’m sure as hell different, but that doesn’t make me any less of a person. I’m proud of who I have become and now I know what the purpose of my life is, and I’m not going to stop chasing it.  -RBZ  “Sometimes the most beautiful people are beautifully broken” -r.m. drake   ",1,beautifully broken spent life afraid true self believed did not live standard norm grew with not accepted told young age act talk dress told money important attending societal event bullshit ball key social success thing trying feel important meant me life screw suddenly perspective change learned longer wanted person said thing important trivial realized did not fuck tory burch shoe chanel bag money bring happiness clearly evident money spent sorry shopping trip therapist thing started falling apart home year old remedy broken family drink not feel despite new fond love alcohol pain killing effect kept life together worked hard school stayed active community sure people thought keeping together not let know fucking mess process slowly lost started living different life curtain wide open people saw girl studious accomplishment is smile face soon curtain closed alone demon came out hid lost myself point alcohol not enough thing gotten worse home needed new escape time did it pair scissors small barely noticeable sworn time hurt again eventually did left college gotten worse second year college reached lowest point toxic emotionally abusive relationship broken relationship parent spent time stuck cycle fighting not speaking pretending okay not spoken older brother struggling addict time year longer knew wa night went bought bottle wine fake id went apartment chugged entire thing sat bathroom floor cry staring knife hand mind thought gun foot away hidden book dad given protection time life looked mortality straight face questioned time like night eventually cry stopped numbness came feeling familiar with it it care consumed darkness small flicker light hope wanted help people wanted day change world change person life not ready leave just yet held tiny hope left me called cop admitted psychiatric center spent hour white walled emotionless prison like place not did ask okay parent came difficult time accepting happened did not understand why knew wanted help saw scar arm knew not okay blamed relationship boyfriend told speak anyone did not want people know crazy i time came believe wa understand just broken year happened struggled lot that better place reason writing promised day help yearold cry help tossed side told overdramatic crazy thought cutting way cope reason grew surrounded mental illness watched not it saw brother parent friend people news struggling demon did not happen life felt like fucking over just trying reason living is spent year ashamed person scared people true raw fucked self not problem come having mental illness believe stigma come attached afraid speak talk it people lucky not experience it not want talk either difference mental illness treated year ago now longer hide chain family member basement attic shame embarrassment there want change that want remove stigma stereotype attached mental illness people talking change start me mean afraid share experience not change life world truly understand like live mental illness finally know difference sympathy empathy is greatest gift come this exploring different topic mental illness trying way change way people think talk it not looking psychological background mental illness neurological background well scientist publishing article different alternative treatment not involve medication favorite topic soon explore detail neuroplasticity brain way rewiring create new circuit essentially new you set goal day create facility afflicted mental illness instead white wall cold stare employee isolation surrounded beautiful color outdoors people actually care current mental health completely utterly fucked up overmedicating people throwing world absolutely regard actual wellbeing treatment actually working not seeing alarmingly increasing rate mental illness time redefine mental illness stick middle finger people tell crazy different maybe crazy sure hell different doe not make person proud know purpose life is not going stop chasing it rbz beautiful people beautifully broken rm drake
"Spending Valentine’s Day alone... when I shouldn’t be. Over the weekend, I told a girl who i thought liked me too about how I felt about her and I asked if she wanted to go to dinner on Valentine’s Day.

"Alienating family Do you ever get tired of saying you're okay when you're not but you don't want to talk about it? So instead you just stop talking to them but then you feel worse for alienating your family and they have no idea why or what's going on with you.   My family has never been super close. We get along with each other and talk to each other but we're not a support system and I don't feel comfortable talking to them about my problems. I feel like I'll be judged and gossiped about so I just keep it to myself and as a result wind up pushing them all away.   The only person in this world I feel I can talk to about my problems are my husband and I know that's a huge burden on him to be my only outlet, my only friend. It's putting a strain on our relationship and I blame myself for this. It's a lot of pressure to put on someone.

"The moment of clarity I've had suicidal ideations for as long as I can remember. Despite this, I always wrote off my depression as not being a problem. Throughout my entire lifetime, my thoughts have been so warped that I just assumed that they are normal parts of the human experience. It sounds so stupid typing things out.

"Friend emotionally unloads on me? I have a particular friend from highschool who always wants to meet up with me. We were good friends then purely due to convenience I feel, and over time we’ve become really different people. She had a bout of depression and has been struggling with these issues for several years now.   I don’t feel like she’s responded to my own issues well, and for some reason her method of reassuring me is to “move on, and get over it”. I’m not quite sure how I feel about that considering I would never say that to her. It’s gotten to the point where she would occasionally send me messages on Facebook about her ill mental health and says that I am the only one she can talk to about this, despite having a boyfriend and other friends already.   I want to cut her off, but at the same time for some reason I feel guilty to? Like here’s an emotionally vulnerable person and I’m not sure if I’m just adding to her despair. But I dread seeing her messages and I get tired thinking about her. I’ve also suggested professional help but she’s shot that down many times.   Am I thinking too much into this? Thoughts?

"I have been so depressed over a lost friendship. I have known this girl for about 5 years. We were very close or so I thought. We both had boys around the same age, went on vacations together with our families, and both went through our 2nd pregnancy together. I knew she was a person that had to have things her way but I accepted this. She has a large circle of friends that she included me in. I felt her family was mine, in a way. I am very shy and came out of my shell. Last year I got caught up with 2 other friends that were having problems. They really needed me. So I wasn't around much but I am always available if she needed me. Anyway, we got into a misunderstanding over something very minor. I really didn't think much about it the next day. That is the way I am. I get mad then I am over it within 24 hours. She is not like that. She holds grudges. I saw her the next day (4th of July) at her house. I knew she didn't really talk to me but she did have a lot of people there. Well,a couple of weeks after I call her saying ""Hey girl, can I pick land on up?"". She said ""How can you call and act like nothing is wrong?"" Then she hangs up on me. I wait until the next day and called again. First thing she says is ""What do you want?"" I say ""Just to be your friend."" She says ""We are no longer friends. There will be no more double dating with our husbands, vacations, you are to not come to my house, We are not friends"". I was blown away. I asked what I did and she couldn't give me a direct answer. She said we had different friends and I had more drama than any of her friends of 20 years. I asked her what drama? Last year I had some problems with my husband but I didn't really talk to her about that. She said  that was a problem, I didn't tell her things and that is what friends do. WHAT? She was contradicting herself. She hung up on me again.  It is very difficult for me because when I make a friend and let them into my heart they are my friend for life. Her son is my son's best friend and her husband is my husbands best friend. I had recently told my husband to not mention their names around me because I become really depressed. My poor son doesn't understand why she doesn't like me anymore. How can I explain when I don't know. I bought her daughter a shirt about a month ago and she didn't acknowledge it until she saw me in Walmart a week later and we were face to face and she thanked me. It was very weird. I haven't seen her since July. I can't let my son have his friend over anymore because it hurts too much to see him and know that I am not welcomed in their home and they haven't asked my son over their house since all of this even though he still came over ours. I can't figure out what I did that was so bad. I wish I knew so that maybe I could at least defend myself and have some closure.

" I just got back from seeing the movie I, Robot starring Will Smith.  Let's just say I was just a tidge disappointed in the movie.  First of all, when I heard that this movie was coming out I picked up the book (not the misleading one with Will Smith on the cover).  I was fascinated by the book in the fact that it was a series of vignettes about the evolution of robots from mindless machines to a species equal to ours, all shown through the eyes of a robot pschoanalyst.  I thought these stories were amazing and saw a definite flow to all the unlinked stories.  This made me very intriqued about how the movie was going to be.     I had read that Alex Proyas was going to take liberties with the plot, but keep Isaac Asimov's vision intact.  I believe he failed, miserably.  What Mr Proyas made was just another unbelievable action movie that appeal to the dense overly stimulated action freak with none of the intended vision to what he speaks of.  It is sad really there was so much emotion and cerebral moments that were lots in the mindless CGI and laws of physics bending fight sequences that have been over used by ever movie since the first Matrix.  In fact they should have called this a Matrix prequal that George Lucas would have been proud of (including the apparently useless sidekick kid from Even Stevens that didn't have to do with anything in the story except a cheap laugh, can you say JAR-JAR).       There was some redeeming value, there was some witty dialogue that kept the plot interesting.  But of course, like all Will Smith movies, there was far too many pointless one-liners.   Another point was the fact that the leading lady wasn't just some no brain supermodel which was hard to believe that she actually could read the script (Denise Richards in The World is Not Enough), but they found some one less than perfect who was actually believable though still too young to be a brilliant scientist.       Overall the movie was entertaining, but not something that Asimov would have been proud to go see.

"I have been recently released from the hospital after a failed suicide attempt.  I am trying to learn how to cope with things and I recently found out that my wife has disclosed the fact that I attempted suicide to many people (about 8) that I really do not know, nor do I feel comfortable with them knowing.  As a matter of fact, I'm very upset about this.  For a little background my wife and i have not had the best relationship for the past 2 - 3 years.  about 18 months ago we moved back to her hometown after I lost my job and she could advance in her career where we are now.  I really don't have any friends down here and have lost contact with my old friends.  I have told 3 people that I attempted suicide (mom, dad, brother) and i knew that her family knew (mom, dad, 2 sisters)  Now my wife tells me that she needed to deal with what I have done and she has told many of her coworkers.  She couldn't talk about this with her family or with her high school friends (which are still in the area, and I have known about 8 years).  She had to tell people that she knows I don't know very well, and of what I do know, I don't like very much.  Now my wife wants me to do more things with her coworkers and I feel very uncomfortable around them.  Am I being too sensitive about this?  Not realizing my wife's needs?  Or am I justified in my being upset?  I will not be able to come back to this board until Monday (tomorrow) evening so I can't post any replies until then.

"I don't think who try to kill themselves actually want to die From my experience and one of a close friend who almost died in a car accident, I think people don't really want to die. We just want the pain to go away. All the shit we take  and all the heavy baggage we have to carry, just makes us tired and lose hope  When we ponder on death, we see an easy way out, so as to get rid of the unbearable agony we suffer.   Moreover, I watched a video of suicide survivors. About those 7% who survived suicide, claimed that in their final moments, when they were throwing themselves from a high place, they said they'd regret everything and wanted to live. Now imagine all those who died and regretted in the last moments.  Personally, I've been close to do it, but my online friends gave me so much support and so much love that I noticed that it's not worth it. I still have things I want to do. Sure getting out of bed is still a huge task. Today it took me 2 hours just to do it, but I did it.   I'm not sure if I should have posted this in suicide or here as it has to do with both.

"i am a 16 year old. i think i am depressed, but i don't know how to tell. um...it is like i am afraid to tell my parents because i know them, they will brush it off as no big deal or make me sit down and tell them what is going on. Did they ever think that i don't want to talk to them? My mother is like a roller coaster ride you cannot wait to get off of. One day she could care less that i am sick, or that i need to tell her something, and then the next day she is all, talk to me, tell me what is going on. God it can be so annoying. i know that i have a problem with my emotions, i just can't seem to control them, when i am upset, stressed, angry, sad. There are always three things that i do. First i cry, then i scream, then i run to my room, and sometimes i might knock something down. And that gets me another, what is going on talk. Two years ago my grandma died. We weren't that close and i think that is part of my problem. every time i try to go to sleep i just lay there and think about my life, and realize, there isn't that one person, you know, everyone has one, that one person that you can just call up and say, ""hey, i am in a bad mood, can you talk..."" or ""hey i just got in another stupid fight with my mom, do you have time to talk to me..."" and maybe that is what is wrong with me, i don't have someone to vent to so i keep it all inside. i mean i try and find ways to let my anger and frustration out like, i am a poet, sort of. Everyone tells me i am at least, but what they don't seem to understand is that maybe i am a good poet because i have nowhere else to let all of this out. No one can see that, no one can see that i need someone to talk to. i try and talk to my mom, but she is so busy, and that is not her fault, it isn't like she is ignoring me on purpose, she has school, she has work, she has my brother's wrestling match, she has a meeting. then i try and talk to my friends, and i know that they would listen and they would try and understand, but i don't know, i just don't feel as though they need all of my crap on their shoulders, not that you do either, who ever is still reading this. i guess it is that sometimes, i feel ignored. i turned sixteen this year. Happy Sweet Sixteen...right? i wanted to have a party, i wanted to go out and have a good time. But that didn't exactly work out the way i had planned. At first i thought that my friends had forgotten about me, no call on my birthday, no card. And then they threw me a surprise party, nothing big and fancy, just small, just the four of us, the way we like it, but still it felt weird, it just didn't feel right. i am supposed to be driving, i have my temporary permit, i have had them since October, you know how much i have driven, about one hour. i could have gotten my license last month, but i cannot go to driving school until i get more experience, and i can't get more experience until one of my parents decides to let me drive.

I don't like to leave my house, and I don't unless I really have to. I am overweight, 39, and very alone in this world. My family tries to stay away from me, they don't talk to me unless they have to. My 14 year old is totally afraid of me, I can see it in her eyes. My 21 year old is bipolar, which makes him more screwed up than I am. He throws me into a panic attack every time I get around him. I have been on all of the medications out there, nothing seems to work for me. They just make me sleep a lot. I went to therapy for about 7 years. That really didn't work either.

"I don't know what my problem is Hello, I've never posted here before. I'm a 28 year old guy and have a decent job that I like, it's quiet and involves a lot of puzzle solving and I'm pretty good at it. I've never had a ton of friends because I'm very particular and not very open with people so it takes a long time to build up relationships, but the friends I do have are outstanding and I wouldn't trade them for anything. I'm kind of the funny guy but my humor is very blue. I got bullied a lot in grade school and learned to make people laugh because it'd get them to not make fun of me. I think it just kind of stuck. I don't know if any of that information is really important, just wanted to give it in case that's something that people do here.    For at least 5 years, I have a hard time doing anything outside of my job alone without crawling up inside my head. All the things that I used to do for enjoyment like listening to music or playing video games, I just can't do anything anymore. It's like a wave of apathy that very rarely lifts. Occasionally, I pick up a razor blade and will press it into my shoulder or hand and I don't really know why to be honest. I don't know if I like the pain or maybe I like having something else to focus on for a minute. Or just to feel something that isn't apathy for a moment.     I think about dying sometimes. Why we're here, what's the point if it ends the same. I doubt I'd ever kill myself because there are things I care about here that I wouldn't leave behind like that, mainly my mom and brother. I worry my brother will end up like me.     Is there anything I can do? I don't know what a pill could do for me or if a pill works. I think the brain is so complex that it couldn't, but I guess I don't know. I don't want to be in a mental fog or be unaware or not be me anymore. I've also always kind of thought that it's human nature to feel this way: that everybody gets down, gets bored, thinks about their mortality, etc. and that I'm just being soft and need to suck it up. Life is difficult, I just need to learn to deal with it maybe.     I don't know what's going on but I don't like feeling like that. If I'm hanging out with friends or family I'm usually fine, it's being alone with myself and having time alone where I can't entertain myself and waste away. I can't really explain it. Does anyone else feel like this? What helps you? I've never talked to a therapist or anything like that and understand you cannot give a diagnosis on here, but if you know any methods to help me get out of that feeling, I'd be eternally grateful. Is this what depression feels like and I've just been in denial about having it for years?",1,not know problem hello posted before year old guy decent job like quiet involves lot puzzle solving pretty good it ton friend particular not open people take long time build relationship friend outstanding not trade anything kind funny guy humor blue got bullied lot grade school learned make people laugh not make fun me think just kind stuck not know information really important just wanted case people here year hard time doing outside job crawling inside head thing used enjoyment like listening music playing video game just anymore like wave apathy rarely lift occasionally pick razor blade press shoulder hand not really know honest not know like pain maybe like having focus minute just feel not apathy moment think dying sometimes here point end same doubt kill thing care not leave like that mainly mom brother worry brother end like me do not know pill pill work think brain complex not guess not know not want mental fog unaware not anymore kind thought human nature feel way everybody get down get bored think mortality etc just soft need suck up life difficult just need learn deal maybe not know going not like feeling like that hanging friend family usually fine having time entertain waste away really explain it doe feel like this help you talked therapist like understand diagnosis here know method help feeling eternally grateful depression feel like just denial having year
"Does anyone else get very irritable whenever you're hungry? The biggest problem in my life is that I get extremely irritable when I'm hungry. I'll find myself fantasizing about getting in argument or getting mad about something and then kinda snap out of it and realize I'm actually just hungry. Then I get something to eat and I can feel some of the stress melting away, taking deep breaths and shit. This happens every day.  This makes me pretty cranky while I'm making something to eat in the kitchen. If anyone tries to talk to me I just want nothing to do with them until I get some food in me.

"I thought things were getting better... Sorry for the little rant... I just needed to say this somewhere.  After recently getting out of the hospital for a(nother) attempt at my life, I was surrounded by family and friends who want to support me. For a couple days this almost gave me a high, thinking that maybe I really am glad I wasn't able to go through with it or that maybe I was beating these years of depressiveness. Not even just after a week of getting out of the mental ward, I fantasize about what I could have done differently to have made sure I died that night. Going forward I thought I would be happy being able to see my younger siblings and my dog again, yet the only thing I can think of is them knowing I tried killing myself, and that I have added just another thing to deal with and another burden on them. I will now be treated with *care* and people will be on guard around me, and I didn't want to do that to them. This semester has started again and I have already missed the first week, and while part of me just wants to drop everything, I can't afford to start paying back the loans. I just want to curl into a ball and not exist and have to deal with it all.  TL:DR - trying to take the easy way out has just made everything harder.",1,thought thing getting better sorry little rant just needed say somewhere recently getting hospital another attempt life surrounded family friend want support me couple day gave high thinking maybe really glad not able maybe beating year depressiveness not just week getting mental ward fantasize differently sure died night going forward thought happy able younger sibling dog again thing think knowing tried killing myself added just thing deal burden them treated care people guard me did not want them semester started missed week just want drop everything afford start paying loan just want curl ball not exist deal all tlr trying easy way just harder

"""I used to be you"" ""It gets better"" ""You have to love yourself first"" &amp; other lies Not even sure if I should post in this sub, but..     To the people who *used to* suffer from depression, from trauma, from anxiety, from whatever made you miserable, I'm not you.       You were once miserable, like me, you saw no light at the end of the tunnel, but then, you didn't give up. *Something* happened. Now you're happier, now you've got your happy ending, now you've got people who love you for who you are. But I'm not you.       You probably changed, you probably were capable of change, were strong enough to change yourself even. I'm not you.      I've been gone for a long time, now. There is nobody here but bad habits and terrible feelings. Sometimes I feel a semblance of someone who just wanted to make other people happy and be loved, but I think the misery just piled on like miles of permafrost.       I can't blame people for not loving me, but I do blame them for lying to me. Don't they know it hurts more to say 'I care' when they don't, and it takes me much too long to figure it out? How am I ever supposed to trust people when they say they care if it's been such a common lie? The worst part is, *nobody can prove it, because nobody can help me, because nobody knows how or wants to*, I don't know. I've been asking for help for a long time now but nobody takes me seriously.      You, who says that I shouldn't give up. Why? I'm not you. Years from now I will *not* be surrounded by people who love me, I will *not* be anywhere closer to happiness, I will *not* find anyone who loves me. If that person exists, and perhaps they do, I will *not* ever have the luck to meet them.       You tell me I have to love myself before anyone else will. Those who grow in complete solitude don't even learn a human language. So tell me, if there is nobody to show me how to, how do you expect me to teach myself to love myself? I think you just want to place the blame on me. I don't 'love' myself and so that's why I am miserable. Not because of depression, not because of isolation, not because of poverty, not because of heartbreak, it's because I don't love myself in a world that's only taught me to hate and criticize myself. In this world where the people I thought I could perhaps give my heart to, say 'I care about you' and then show me those words are meaningless.      Forgive me for being skeptical about getting better when I've only seen my life decline since it began. I'm not even asking for pity, because I know it's just the luck of the draw and I was dealt a particularly shitty hand. But can you please understand that not all of us are going to be okay in the end? Just because you suffered for many years and I've suffered for many years and you no longer suffer like you used to, doesn't mean I'm not going to continue suffering as I always have been.

"""I don't wanna die, but I ain't keen on livin' either."" Sorry for the Robbie lyric. I just want to vocalize a bit before the rare fancy passes and I go back to soldiering on alone. I'm sorry if this rambles or doesn't quite make sense, but if I leave the stream of consciousness or reread I will probably delete because I loathe the idea of complaining to others or whinging knowing full well I've probably got it better than most people here. But a part of me wants to know that someone else experiences depression the same way, as some small solace.      I'm never particularly sad, nor do I hate or wish harm upon myself or my life or the people in it. However, in every waking moment I have a weight emanating from my core, like a gravitational pull sucking in my ability to want anything meaningful.      The best way I can put it is in the title - I simply don't want to *be*. And that's not because I'm overwhelmed by hardship or struggle, I've got it pretty good and there's nowhere I'd rather be. If, hypothetically, you took me back to before my birth and laid out an incredible life for me and said ""alright, you're about to be born, ready to go?"" I'd say ""no thanks, I'm good"".      With a core belief like that there's no life to live. Career advancement serves no purpose but to consume more time, and I'd be taking a good job from someone who actually gets some personal value out of it. Romance is off the cards because someone who wants to date someone who doesn't want anything from life, probably also isn't worth being with. And heaven forbid someone should want kids! Hey Junior, daddy doesn't like his existence but he had you anyway, what an asshole.     I should stop before I become some combination of ""old man yells at cloud"" and ""whiny emo stereotype"". This stuff sits on me every day and I wish the small part of me that wants the affirmation of others wasn't there.

So he gets up in the afternoon. But does he tell me he's done this to MY clock? NO. When I call him to ask him if he did this(which I already know he did)does he apologize? NO. He never apologizes. My angry response negates an apology. See...things are always about him. Screw what the rest of us need. He set that clock to HIS work time. Never mind that he never needs it to wake up. I wake him up, or the kids wake him up.   Ever been so pissed you can't go back to sleep even though you are dead tired?

"Difference between antidepressent starting side-effects and hypomania? Hey all,  So I've read about how SSRIs can send bipolar people who are misdiagnosed with unipolar depression / anxiety into hypomania or mania. I've also read that SSRIs can have activating effects during the start up period (including insomnia, restlessness, distractibility) that sound similar to some of the symptoms of hypomania.   So if someone starting and SSRI experiences trouble sleeping, restlessness, increased energy, increased distractibility, periods of euphoria, spends money like it's nothing, increased pressure to talk/sing/dance, increased responses to music and caffeine, starting up old hobbies, etc.,  how can they know whether it's a combination of start-up side effects of the SSRI + feeling (much) better from the SSRI (or maybe placebo / excitement from doing something about the depression) or an antidepressant-induced hypomanic episode?  I know it's a question for a professional but I like to hear experiences also.

Otherwise, we were always talking to eachother and we cared for and loved eachother a great deal and did heaps for eachother but yeh she did in fact cut me off because I didn't reply to her messages one day.

"I read ""The Art of Happiness"" a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it. The Dalai Lama is something else. I've forgotten a lot of it but I do remember him saying that we should strive to be unswayed by emotion so that we don't differentiate between good things happening or bad things. I am the opposite of this. When good things happen I feel good. When bad things happen I feel bad. I loved what you said about there being no such thing as self loathing in Tibet. I wonder if this means there is no depression. I've always wanted to be a monk. Maybe that's the answer. Thanks for the interesting post Harlequin. I will now go and Google breathing meditation.

I had skipped work today because this dream was too good to just let the alarm clock interrupt it. I've been able to hold onto my dreams a lot lately. Such as I can wake up and roll over and fall back asleep in the exact spot in the dream I left off....  Now the dream is I'm at some party. The room is very lavish looking. And everyone there I know. Feels like this party was somehow for me. Never has ever happened. Now the part that stands out is that I see my teacher who was my mentor she was everything to me. When I was in high school I not only had this HUGE crush on her but she was the kind of actor I had always wanted to be except I was willing to die for my art. Still am. She's sitting with her two kids. They're probably the most gorgeous kids I've ever seen and she hasn't changed. Her husband is in the distance somewhere. I never see him but I am aware of him. I thank her for all her time and effort she put into me and I ask her how it's going with her life and if she's still teaching. We talk about something else and the dream slowly fades away.  Reality is I haven't heard from this teacher since I graduated. I heard she had a kid and she moved to vermont. I miss her terribly. Somehow this dream seems to have more than just one meaning. And since everyone else has dream threads I'm going for one too. ,1,skipped work today dream good just let alarm clock interrupt it able hold dream lot lately wake roll fall asleep exact spot dream left off dream party room lavish looking know feel like party me happened stand teacher mentor me high school not huge crush kind actor wanted willing die art am sitting kid probably gorgeous kid seen not changed husband distance somewhere aware him thank time effort ask going life teaching talk dream slowly fade away reality not heard teacher graduated heard kid moved vermont miss terribly dream just meaning dream thread going too

And to top it all off, my period is due tomorrow which cuts my tolerance in half.

"Just graduated university. Anxious and depressed, can't find a job, scared of losing partner over it Hi everyone. This is my first post on Reddit. I just felt like I needed advice from people who might understand.   I'm in my early twenties and just graduated with a bachelor degree in psych in October. I never really had a job during that time because I was lucky to have my school and expenses paid for and I wanted to focus on school. I've only had one job but it was 5 years ago just at a fast food place. My boyfriend of almost 4 years and I live together. He has a great job and pays for 2/3 of our expenses and I pay the rest. He's recently told me he doesn't see a future for us if I don't get my life together and find a job and start putting more into the relationship. I feel this is coming at a bad time because ever since I graduated I am really anxious and depressed. I find it hard to even get up in the morning, chores get neglected, I don't even want to get out of the safety of my bed. The world is bleak and I'm sad all the time. I can't sleep all night and then sleep till mid afternoon. I feel like my life is just staying home and having to do chores and feel sad. I try to apply to entry level jobs like cashier at the grocery store but no one calls back. I don't know what to do because I want to get better and don't want to lose my bf but I can't even get an interview to work at a high school level job. He has been really supportive and caring but I think he is getting to the end of his rope. I feel stuck and hopeless. Any suggestions?

"Losing my brother My brother died suddenly Friday night. He was 38. He was pretty much estranged from most of the family, spent some years making bad decisions and doing drugs and it caught up to him. He was trying to straighten out his life and cut out drugs and negative friends, from what I’d heard. He was in the ICU recently with heart failure and pneumonia. We talked while he was in the hospital, a lot of apologies and crying and encouragement, just a brother and sister having a conversation. The next day his blood pressure was supposedly good enough for him to be released. 10 days later, he was gone.  My family members are taking it in their own ways.

"I was just curious what your feelings are on long-term outcomes for depression. A little background for me: I've been on and off medicines for several years. I was always depressed as a child, but didn't really seek professional help until maybe 10 years ago. I originally went on medicines. for severe pms prescribed to me by my ob-gyn. I just kind of continued on with it because it made me feel ""leveled out"". Then I had issues with sleep apnea, joint pains etc. My neurologist put me on Effexor. Every time I tried to go off that drug I was dizzy and had bad side effects. Finally, I reduced the dose myself and weaned myself off the Effexor. I had gained a tremendous amount of weight. I was off all medicines for 8 months and then I really feel into a dark depression. It was then that I sought a therapist, etc. I have been on medicines ever since...since June of 2004. I had lost 40 pounds by going off the medicines, but then became depressed again. following several deaths and major life events. I was put on Lexapro and gained weight. Not wanting to gain weight again, I hated being on the medicines. He kept saying it will stabilize. I told him that the weight gain was making me more depressed. Finally, he changed my medicines to Wellbutrin. We talked about trying to go off medicines when life events settled down...my main reason to go off was the weight gain. Immediately the weight came back off. That was a year ago. Now a year later, I am still losing about a pound or two a month. The last time I went in, he didn't say anything about going off the medicines. How long do people take medicines? Is it just better to stay on them and not fall back into the hole? Are there any long-term use side effects to be concerned with? Is this something I will probably be on forever? It just seems like I will always be like this. It just seems like depression is always just standing back in the shadows. I go for a very long time and feel fine and then I have a week where I get very down and know that if I wasn't on medicines. it would be very bad. I haven't gone to talk to my therapist in a long while. When I am having these bouts of depression, should I call and say I need to go in for a ""check-up"". I don't really have any specific issues to discuss. The big thing right now is I just feel down because I have lost my closest friends and don't feel like I have any friends to do anything with. I feel so isolated. Would it be good to just call and go in? I just feel stupid saying I feel sad because I don't have any friends. Are there any good books that you can recommend on self-help--esp. negative thinking, understanding why I think the way I do, etc. I found Dr. Phil's book on Life Strategies to be very helpful in discovering that there are reasons why I do things and think.",1,just curious feeling longterm outcome depression little background me medicine year depressed child did not really seek professional help maybe year ago originally went medicine severe pm prescribed obgyn just kind continued feel leveled out issue sleep apnea joint pain etc neurologist effexor time tried drug dizzy bad effect finally reduced dose weaned effexor gained tremendous weight medicine month really feel dark depression sought therapist etc medicine sincesince june lost pound going medicine depressed again following death major life event lexapro gained weight not wanting gain weight again hated medicine kept saying stabilize told weight gain making depressed finally changed medicine wellbutrin talked trying medicine life event settled downmy main reason weight gain immediately weight came off year ago year later losing pound month time went in did not say going medicine long people medicine just better stay not fall hole longterm use effect concerned with probably forever just like like this just like depression just standing shadow long time feel fine week know not medicine bad not gone talk therapist long while having bout depression say need checkup not really specific issue discus big thing right just feel lost closest friend not feel like friend with feel isolated good just in just feel stupid saying feel sad not friend good book recommend selfhelpesp negative thinking understanding think way do etc dr phil book life strategy helpful discovering reason thing think

"Does Trading Help Your Depression? Maybe I am a bit weird in this regard, but I do quiet well in this regard. I have not traded too much because of life circumstances, and thus the past few years have been depressed, as my one best friend is in jail and the other has adopted asceticism. I also moved to a new area and broke up with my ex. I have been thinking stuff over, and even though winning at coding can make me slightly happy, I feel like whenever I am trading I am on fire and feel like my ""true"" self, whereas otherwise I feel blah.

" So how many blogs do I have now? Let's count...probably 4, and I usually only use one which is Dead Journal. But hey, I want a new taste...so I'm gonna use blogger again. For the 3rd time? lol   It was (still is) very windy today. I like this cool breeze...although it was really hot today.   The moment I got up today I knew I was going to have a good day, cuz I woke up briskly and eager to go to Saturday School. But now that I think about it...today was a REALLY tiring day. The most tiring day I've ever had at Saturday School maybe. I mean HAL!! Hal is SO GODDAMN loquacious! (Hahah, there goes my vocab again...) He would NOT shut up!! We did show and tell again and he would make either a sarcastic remark or a ""Oh I have that"" to everything everyone says. YOU SMARTASS!! And then for HIS show and tell, guess what he gets out... fossils and anmonites.  He even made this presentation-board type of thing. And he talks back to me, says mean things that he doesn't mean, etc...that kid absolutely drives me  mad.  But what the hell, at least he's somewhat entertaining...half the laughter in that class is caused by Hal's smartness (and stupidness...today he said 'Stupidity counts in everything.' Daresama yanen...lol) . Talked to Victor today, was nice...he's so cute, hehe. It's so weird how my heart jumps whenever I see him. But his hideous sense of BAGS and HATS are disturbing...lol I guess he likes that military color combination...  Yusuke, Hiroaki, and I were gonna go to a movie tonight but since we found out it ends at 9:05, we cancelled it...plus we might not have gotten tickets, we were planning to see  Day After Tomorrow . That comes out today! So then we planned to go out to dinner, but since I finish work at 5 we postponed that as well. lol   Apparently I might be going to prom with Hiroaki...? Yusuke and Jyongri persuaded him to go with me, and it might just happen! It all depends on if he has the whole outfit though, I hope he does. Well whatever, I'm not too concerned with going dateless after all. As long as we all have a good time...  Speaking of packing, I leave in  15 days!!!  Do you read that Courtney, I'LL BE IN THE SAME GODDAMN COUNTRY IN 15 DAYS! I'll be sure to give you a call when I get to Indiana kk? ;) Ahhhh I'm so excited...XD XD   I must go do homework now.

"Unsure how to talk to friend about something they're doing, or well, not doing. [Advice] First time poster in need of a bit of advice. Sorry this'll be long.  So basically, I've been having a bit of an issue with a friend of mine, we've been friends for around 3 years at this point and everything was great! We'd talk every day and hang out around once a week/2 weeks depending on schedules and [my] kids schedules etc.  Then about 8(ish) months ago, she got a new boyfriend, and of course I'm really happy for her, she deserves all the happiness!   Thing is though, over the last 5 months, there's been a steep decline in conversation between myself, said friend and another friend.  Friend #2 and I have been making ALL the effort to make plans with friend #1 and we're getting almost nothing back.  We'll text her and we'll not hear anything for days, but she's on Facebook or snapchat posting pictures of her and her new boyfriend, and when she does text back, it's a totally one sided conversation. Like I'll ask her maybe ""how have you been"" and I;ll get a page of text about how she has been with BF and what they've been doing and at the end it'll be ""okay, I got to go, bye!"" If I don't specifically ask her about her baby (who I adore, she's like my niece) I don't hear about her, at all. It's all about BF.  Recently, Friend #1 and I didn't see each other for just over 3 months! (did I mention she lives 20 minutes away from me?) No matter how many times I asked her over, offered to go to her house, offered to take her to coffee etc, either the invite went unacknowledged, or she wanted to spend the time with her BF.  At that point, I was a bit annoyed but, I understood that people have lives and sometimes things just don't match up. However, the reason I'm looking for advice is because, after not seeing her for 3 months and talking to her only a handful of times, she hits me up and asks if I can watch her baby so she can go out with another friend. (who wasn't even going, she took her BF)  I said yes, as I know how it is to want to go out and not to have a babysitter, so my husband and I watched baby over night for her. The ONLY thing I said to her was that I had plans the next day after 1 so I needed her to be back before then. (spoiler: she wasn't!) So I couldn't do my plans and asked friend #1 to stay and hangout since I hadn't seen her for so long.  In the 1 hour(!) that she stayed, she called my sister (who I had plans with - we were meant to take my youngest out for his birthday, because friend hadn't come back yet, my sister took him out by herself) a freak!  She said 3 times ""imagine not waiting for you!""  I said to her, we'll it's because you weren't back and she blamed traffic for being 2 hours late...  On top of the main incident, there's been an incident where she brought a stranger to my house (after I told her I didn't like strangers in my house or around my children) and expected me to be okay with it!  She dropped the bomb of bringing this stranger to my house 15 minutes before they arrived and told them I didn't want them there so they felt awkward! (I did try really hard to make them feel welcome, and thankfully the kids had plans so they weren't put in the situation)  The advice I'm seeking is  - A. How do I talk to friend #1 about this without coming off as bitchy or upsetting her.  and B. Should I keep being friends with her?   I don't like to give up on a friendship, but I feel like she only wanted me around when she wanted something from me.   Any advice is welcome, even if it's me being weird or whatever.

"Hosted my sister’s baby shower, only to be a second thought the next day Hi Reddit! I’m wondering if I’m being too emotional about this and could use your opinion. I flew from Utah to Boston and arrived Thursday morning on a red eye. From 6am Thursday to 3am Saturday, my mom and I prepped for my sisters baby shower. I see her once or twice a year, but the three of us talk almost everyday on a group chat, and we’re close. My mom and I stopped prepping briefly Friday night to meet her, her husband, and her best friend (who flew in that night) for dinner- so that was the first time I was seeing her this trip, same as her friend. The best friend stayed at her house while I was staying with my mom.  So Saturday we had the shower for 25 people. Huge hit. Sister was very very appreciative and loved it. I had brought my suitcase in the event I slept over there, so I could have more time with her Sunday morning. This is generally normal. Once the shower wrapped, her friend brought my suitcase down...sort of a “here you go, bye.”  The main Sunday plan was to watch the AFC game back at her house, at 3pm. I woke up after some major sleep catch up at 10:30 and asked the mom/sister group text, “what should we do today kids??” To which my sister replied that her and her girlfriend are getting breakfast and meeting up with the girlfriend’s husband’s cousin (who also lives in Boston) and that they’d be back at the house at 2:30 before the game.   My flight back to Utah is 6am Monday, so today (Sunday) was really the only time to see her.  I didn’t respond to that message. Around 1pm I told my mom that I didn’t want to watch the game with them, and I’d rather go downtown and watch it in a bar since I was feeling extremely hurt after putting all that work in for her shower, and then feel like an after thought the next day. So, Mom and I went to a bar and watched it.  Sister and her husband blew up at me for being so “selfish” and are not talking to me. Husband went so far as to say I’m not welcome to see the baby when he comes. Crazy.  I guess I should have put a smile on my face and just showed up for the game at 3? I would have if I ever stopped crying.   Thoughts??

" Woohoo! My Very First Blog. I'm so happy. Now I'm gonna' spill my heart out like a naive little 3 year old! Or something like that.  So Today was the last actual day of school. I'm so happy, now we've got finals to do. What fun. I've got Japanese and Computer Literacy. We did nothing at school today whatsoever. It was really retarded, but it was fun, cause the teachers were somewhat intimidated and forked over tons of candy in a last ditch to maintain some semblance to order.  It worked.  During Science, M*rr*s (take that Google!) was a meanyhead, making me take the darn remote and fast forward through commercials, then count field trip money, then do this, and that, and so forth. Me no like M*rr*s. Oh well. SHE'S GONE FOREVER FROM MY LIFE AFTER THIS. I'm so freakin' happy.  History was kinda' stupid, but Micah and I chased each other around, and Ms. Yi got pissed. Japanese was kool, cause Austin and I got to sumo wrestle or something like it. Everyone was goofing off. It was awesome.  CS, I was locked in a room with Sm*th for a whole period. I was scared. He's still pissed at me, I think. Here's where background is required. He was dissing Mozilla (!), and how they were heralding ThunderBird as the next generation of email thing. Then he proceeds to diss all of Mozilla, including Composer and FireFox. Then, the final straw, he calls ThunderBird FireBird. So I tell him he's wrong and tell him that FireBird was the 1st generation of the  FireFox browser. He just kinda' stares at me. So I'm not sure whether he was really, really pissed or amazed that someone as computer illiterate as me would know that.  Skipping all other classes, I get to English with B*l*sta, 8th Period. I tried to behave in class, and this is the 4th day of the year that I managed to actually pay attention!!! But I got this pencil, and wrote on my binder, ""Blinder than a Mother-Freakin' Doorknob"" with an arrow pointing to my right.   Ms. B*l&sta walks over and has her back to me. She gives a really long, like  5 minute lecture with me holding this next to her. It was picture perfect, and Micah nerly died laughing. No kidding.  At home, I IM'd and got in fights w/ my parents.

" I have a lot of kids, the fur baby kind. I love each and every pet I meet. That doesn't necessarily mean that I WANT each and everyone that I meet, because I don't. I believe that they all need to have their OWN homes where they are special. To me they are all special. It can be very hard to make all the cats  feel  special and I do try to make them feel that way. I don't like to see them broken hearted when a new one arrives. That causes me stress. Sometimes new arrivals require alot of attention and the other cats get their feelings hurt and start to shy away. That breaks my heart too. Plain fact is that I need help. I need foster parents to take in orphaned babies so they can be adopted. At work we get so many calls of people finding orphaned kittens and the shelters here are full. I can't take them because my sancutary cats have been exposed to FIP. If they come here they have to stay forever. I already found 5 orphaned kittens myself. I had no where to send them so now they are here to stay. Anyone out there want to help bottle feed babies? If you do and live in Pensacola, FL call me: 261-0760 or 492-6878. I will start a list and give notice at work that I have foster families! That would be too cool! Those of us that work in a Vet Office, we are there because we LOVE what we do and we LOVE animals.

"Well, it's been a year now since I tried killing myself A year ago on December 1st I tried to kill myself. I spent a week in a psych ward and have been on lots of meds and doing lots of therapy since then. The therapy has helped quite a bit, I've slowly learned how to listen to myself and how to take things one day at a time. As far as meds go, my anxiety is much more controllable and my sleeping meds actually work (mostly) so I can't complain too much.  I don't think I'm ever going to overcome depression. I've kind of learned to live with it, sure, but beating it probably won't happen; I'm way too cynical to beat it. It's just how I'm wired. There's a lot in life I probably won't get to experience because of how I am. And I still don't know how to change that, or at least make some good out of it.  I guess what I'm trying to say with this post is, I'm not sure if I'm happy or not. It's the not knowing that bugs me. I know I'm better than I was a year ago, but I still feel lost, and I don't know where to go from here. Every day is just a haze that I trot through.  Sorry for the rambling.

"Alright, this is a bit weird to explain, but I am having a lot of trouble making this decision so I am going to try and write it down. If anyone has any suggestions or advice to offer I would appreciate it. A while back my brother and I let a stray cat in and fed it, and we got really attached to it. It is probably the most needy animal I have ever met and will sit with people all day, loves it when you pet it, and I really like the cat. I wasn't thinking at the time, but later I realized I needed to pay a pet deposit like the rest of the people in my complex, so I could keep the cat. So my mother called up our landlord's office and they said that we could not have the cat. It seems really unfair to me that everyone else is allowed animals, but for some reason we are not. I don't think there is anything I can do about this and it makes me really sad. We didn't want to get rid of the cat so bad that we decided to hide the cat away, letting it inside only at night, and living in my brother's van in the day while we were looking to see if there was somewhere else we could move to. The problem is, I think I would only barely have enough money to move and I think it would be too risky that my family would lose our assistance if we were to go through with such a thing. Not to mention that I keep my spare money around in the case of emergencies and if something bad were to happen, I wouldn't be able to deal with it financially. So the only option I know of that is left is the animal shelter and I really do not want my cat to be locked up and possibly die alone in a cage. I know that it is getting old and that people take younger cats from animal shelters much more often than older ones. I want my cat to have a good place to live and don't want it to spend its final years in a cage, without loving owners. I am having so much trouble making this decision... I love my cat a lot and want it to be taken care of well and to be happy, but I am endangering my family the longer I try to hide it. My mother and brother keep telling me that it is my decision to make and I just keep procrastinating. So I posted this here because it is making me depressed and stressed out. Are there any options I am leaving out? Do I either have to spend all of my money to move or give it to an animal shelter? They both seem like such terrible options",1,alright bit weird explain having lot trouble making decision going try write down suggestion advice offer appreciate it brother let stray cat fed it got really attached it probably needy animal met sit people day love pet it really like cat not thinking time later realized needed pay pet deposit like rest people complex cat mother called landlord office said not cat really unfair allowed animal reason not not think make really sad did not want rid cat bad decided hide cat away letting inside night living brother van day looking to problem is think barely money think risky family lose assistance thing not mention spare money case emergency bad happen not able deal financially option know left animal shelter really not want cat locked possibly die cage know getting old people younger cat animal shelter older one want cat good place live not want spend final year cage loving owner having trouble making decision love cat lot want taken care happy endangering family longer try hide it mother brother telling decision make just procrastinating posted making depressed stressed out option leaving out spend money animal shelter like terrible option

"I have lived with depression since I was little. I was molested by my uncle and a family friend and my dad is in and out of prison all the time (I'm guessing that is where it all started from). Well, when I hit my freshman year in high school, I had no friends because I was so shy. I walked the halls alone, went to lunch alone, sat in the back of the classroom alone. I sat back there fantasizing about suicide and death, and I would cut myself, and I actually planned my suicide. By this point I was so far ""out of my mind"" that I couldn't take it anymore, so I went to my mom. I was diagnosed with severe depression, and I've been in counseling on and off ever since. I am now 18 years old, and I have made friends since, and i even got a boyfriend. Well. I haven't seen my counselor for a while now, and in the past few months I feel like my depression is worse than it has ever been. So many things have been happening to me, that I just can't take it anymore. I lost the friends that I had, and I don't even know why exactly. My boyfriend just broke up with me, after we had been together for two years. I've started to cut myself again. i want to be dead. I know I should go to see my counselor, and i tried to make an appointment, but i feel it's too late. i feel like I'm on the edge of a huge cliff, and if I get pushed just a little more, I'm done. i don't know what to do, I just cant take it anymore! If someone could please just give me some advice I would greatly appreciate it.

I let him be my friend again, and he outed me as bi to my religious summer camp, which I then had to leave.

I told him I was done being friends with him because he constantly endangers me or puts me in uncomfortable positions, and he called me crying about how he just wishes things were ""like they were in freshman year"" and that he ""should have never lied to them"".

"Feeling numb I’ve realized that if I can’t talk to someone about my feelings then the next best thing is to write them down and seek advice from reddit so here I am. I’m on campus right now preparing for my midterm and my confidence is at an all time low. I haven’t even seen the paper and already I feel as if I’ve lost. I never thought I would reach such a low in my life. Something weird happened today. I finally set up a countdown timer to the day my exam results are announced. That seemed like the next logical step and it made complete sense to me in a weird way. The only thing that made me remove that was talking to my parents and seeing the hope and love for me in their eyes. I know my life isn’t truly mine and that if I hurt myself then I also hurt other people but it’s just getting too much. The thought is always there in my mind and for the past few days that voice has gotten stronger. I’ve been through this period before and had come out nearly unharmed and at the beginning of the year I was feeling optimistic about what’s to come but that lasted all of one month. The future I was dreaming of looks bleak and distant and with every passing minute that future keeps on going farther and farther away from me. I try very hard to keep my guard up near people I know and love but it’s becoming harder and harder to do so. I used to think that I was destined to do some good in the world but maybe that was just me being delusional. It’s getting harder to keep the tears in. Whenever I used to feel numb, I used to punch the wall just to feel something but even that is not helping now. All I wanna do is talk to someone and pour my heart out but I don’t know if I have the strength left to do that. Getting out of bed is starting to feel like a struggle and for the first time in a while I’m afraid of myself, of what I might do if things don’t go my way. I know that this is not the end of the line but why does it feel like it is? How can anyone recover from such a failure? It’s gotten so bad that I would much rather prefer that I disappeared than having to tell my parents what’s wrong. Depression is nothing new for my university and it wouldn’t be the first time that someone took a drastic step and now I know why they did what they did. The pressure and stress which comes with a university as respected as mine, is just too much to handle. I’m almost inclined to reveal my university’s name just in case someone’s able to figure out who I am and I can finally get the respite I desire so much. All around me I see happy faces and I can only hope that one day I can leave all this behind me and be happy but in the meantime I guess I just have to struggle on and wait for the light at the end of the tunnel.

"I'm not worth it I just don't feel like I'm worth anyone's time or effort, and I just feel like a burden to everyone.  I have a part time job (anywhere between 20-39 hours a week) and I'm at college (in the UK &amp; I'm 18)and I'm constantly tired.  My mum is such a lovely person, but I really do feel like she'd be better off without me, she's always complaining how she never has time to do anything (she works 30 hours a week + she always cooks + cleans up after my stepdad and brother but complains about any mess I've made)  and I'm lazy, messy and I quite often ruin her day. But I'm sure I've ruined her whole life.  She had me when she was 19, which meant she had to quit her job because she couldn't afford childcare and she had an abusive step-dad, who would refuse to let her mum look after me, and she also fell out with her very religious grandparents as she wasn't married (they have since made up). She then couldn't get a job until I started school (which is actually a decent job). At this new job, she met my step-dad (after a few years) and they've since had a child together (who also doesn't seem to like me one bit). My step dad seems to hate me more than my mum does, but I can't complain because neither of them are abusive, and this is one of my problems; I feel like I shouldn't moan about anything in my life; I live in a decent sized 3 bedroom house, I have an education and I also have a job. Whilst my mum lived with her abusive step-dad, was forced to quit college (so she could get a job to start paying rent) and was also forced to baby sit whilst her parents went out drinking every other night. Yet here I am, never feeling happy, without many friends (I talk to the people at work when I'm there and I have 2 other friends that I speak to around twice a month, normally because there other friends are busy and they want to complain about their boyfriends, or because the other friend doesn't want to go  shopping on her own ( another reason why I don't have a reason to be negative; she was in care and now classified as homeless as she's now 18 and not catered for in the care system, so now she has to live in temporary accommodation with lots of drug users in the same building.)  I feel like I just ruin everything, if I'm downstairs with my family, there always seems to be an argument, even if I'm not involved in the argument. But if everyone else is in the living room, whilst I'm upstairs in my own, I can only ever here them laughing and enjoying themselves. It's like, even when I haven't done anything, I seem to just produce a negative atmosphere.  I really don't want to be here anymore, if I disappeared, it wouldn't really effect any one, my mum might be upset at first but she'd quickly realise how much better her life is without me. The problem is that I'm even too lazy and stupid to kill myself, so I'm just secretly hoping that a medical issue that has been ongoing for a while (and I haven't been to the doctor's in years because I would just be wasting their time, when they could be helping someone better than me) is serious, and nature will take its cause...",1,not worth just not feel like worth time effort just feel like burden everyone time job anywhere hour week college in uk amp and constantly tired mum lovely person really feel like better me complaining time she work hour week cook clean stepdad brother complains mess made lazy messy quite ruin day sure ruined life meant quit job not afford childcare abusive stepdad refuse let mum look me fell religious grandparent not married they up not job started school which actually decent job new job met stepdad after year child who doe not like bit step dad hate mum doe complain abusive problem feel like not moan life live decent sized bedroom house education job whilst mum lived abusive stepdad forced quit college so job start paying rent forced baby sit whilst parent went drinking night am feeling happy friend i talk people work friend speak twice month normally friend busy want complain boyfriend friend doe not want shopping reason not reason negative care classified homeless not catered care system live temporary accommodation lot drug user building feel like just ruin everything downstairs family argument not involved argument living room whilst upstairs own laughing enjoying themselves like not anything just produce negative atmosphere really not want anymore disappeared not really effect one mum upset quickly realise better life me problem lazy stupid kill myself just secretly hoping medical issue ongoing and not doctor year just wasting time helping better me serious nature cause

Problems: I don't have a cent to my name, parents will not give their ok on the issue and I haven't had a job in over a year and there are no prospects in the near future. I could go behind their backs and apply for a loan but I would just feel a lot better knowing they were ok with it all, I don't want money from them. Some meaningless minimum wage job is not going to make me feel good, if anything it will make me feel worse about myself.

"How to disown my sister How do I remove my 18 year old sister from the family? I’m her younger brother (16) and all my life my sister has been nothing but manipulative towards my parents. The main issue is when she turns my mom and Dad against each other, resulting in her being free to do whatever while our parents scream at each other, leading to my mom crying or then separating for a few days. This isn’t the first time it’s happened, which is why I’m taking into serious consideration of kicking her out of our family. I understand my sister means a lot to me so it won’t be easy but her behavior have made my mom cry more times than I can count. Unfortunately, my parents are also very soft on her so they will not go along with me trying to disown her.   I understand some people might think I’m a terrible person but I have lost a lot of respect for my sister where this seems to be the only Option.

"Calling me a bitch as a form of endearment not cool This was a great friend of seven years. We had so much in common and a few things not in common. We met in our mid and early 20s (im being 5 years younger). We met on a the job years ago.  Well five months ago when she was stressing about her day...  Listen bitch our manager gave us more rules....  Time froze like huh? :/😨 Also I'm 30 shes 35.  I let it slide since I thought maybe that was a mistake. Maybe she was so stressed out?  Well it didn't end and got worse...  Everyday she leave me text messages, and recordings updating me of her life and each sentence I was called a bitch.  Listen BITCH.... Yeeees BITCH..... Then this BITCH at work....,but you get me BITCH.... I told myself, BITCH you need to hit the gym  ( Yes at times she called herself a bitch which is fine.)  Lucky for men they'll never get called bitch by her.   I made excuses for her saying maybe it's a temp phase. 3 months in I told her I don't like being a bitch every sentence positive or not. She said this how her and her family always talked. I thought I known you for 7 years...never heard of this. Then she continued to talk and yup calling me a bitch.   I continued telling her to stop at times. Other times I just tried to ignore.   One month ago she texted me that shes working with a nurse who is a woman who has a grill in her mouth. And how cool she thought that was. And how she hopes to become a nurse someday with a grill.  I had to catch myself....to me grills look ugly on men and worse on women😝. I faked it like....yea...um cool... :/  Well a 5 days ago I got fed up. I told her 6 days ago calling me a BITCH 50 or so times a day must stop!    We never had a argument...maybe a few disagreements.  She went off and was pissed I didn't want to be called bitch for fun. I told her I'm not a dog in heat! I told her my name and that I'm  a girl or woman hell even calling me a female is nicer. She said shes not about that girl power or that feminism crap!   FYI...shes actually into feminism and don't know it. I would love to be a house wife,take my voting rights away and I love dresses. Shes willing to support a 3rd world man soon,talk about how if she gets a great degree she can support her man lol.  I felt myself at the time great sadness here she was going off at me for not wanting to be called a bitch. She then says her family call each other bitches alllll the time.   After she went off....she went back to talking about how she wants to go to school. I never felt so degraded and disrespected.  I decided this friendship ends. I'm very nice, and consider how others feel....she basically treated me like a door mat.  Next day I texted her I'm not a dog. Not into being called a bitch daily and I no longer can do this. After I texted that I blocked her number asap.   It's crazy about 3 or 4 months ago. She was mad that when she called a coworker a bitch instead of saying girl or other friendly terms...she caught that coworker talking about her warning others to stay clear of her because she will call you a bitch. She called me about it all mad. I told her I actually understand that girl....she completely ignored my remark.  I plan on changing my number soon...maybe.   But I do feel better that I don't have to hear that hood talk anymore.   I was her only friend. Hopefully she can make new friends who don't mind being called that daily.   I have friends and recently by mistake made a new one. New one is like me and we respect each others boundaries.  I like that shes another race as well,so I can learn her view of things.

"I cut off my best friend because she was a flake NOW she wants me back ( Am I wrong for declining?) **TLDR**: I cut off my Best friend of 5 years for being flakey and unreliable this summer. She tries to guilt trip me into taking her back. She bought me a gift while visiting in Korea and wanted to give it to me this Saturday. I said ok at first but sent her a text this morning declining the gift and the offer. I feel guilty. Am I wrong?    **Long Story (detailed)**:              My friend and I had been friends since high school ( I am now 23 and she is now 21). I ended our friendship this summer after giving her numerous chances over the years. Long story shortish, she would never keep her word when it came to meeting up, she was super inconsistent and only really reached out when it was convenient for her. She would always be ""too busy"", she'd change our plans to hang out with others, or she'd flake out all together and not call or show. We both went to separate colleges in different towns so meeting up was hard and hanging out regularly was pretty difficult. I was always the one who would reach out to see how she was doing and I was always the one to initiate are hang out sessions. We would make plans to meet up a month in advance and the week of our planned day, she would flake out. After a while, I started calling her out and she would beg and cry exclaiming that she would change, but she never did. I would text her and she'd never text back. I called her once after a hard day at school and she rushed me off the phone but whenever she would call me for help and advice I was always there front and center ready to listen. I would ask her to help me out and she bail at the last minute due to scheduling conflict or her failing to think ahead. I once asked her to pick me up from the airport. I asked 3 times if she was sure if she could and she reassured me that she'd be able to. A couple of days before the day that she was supposed to pick me up, she calls me talking in circles only to tell me that she couldn't do it. I was broke and couldn't really afford a lyft. Luckily I was able to reach my dad.            Over the summer things got even worse. She turned 21 and I had tried several times to link up and take her out. She bailed both times. The first time she bailed because I guess she forgot that she needed to pick up her aunt from the airport. The second time she made date night plans with her boyfriend. It continued to persist. she was teaching me how to drive but didn't think enough of me to let me know when she was going to cancel. Instead, she ghosted me for a week only to blame it on the fact that she was too busy to text me or call me.        In September, I had had it! I deleted her on facebook and i blocked her number. She added me back a week later and then I blocked her. Feeling bad, November I reached out one last time to see if we could talk things through. She said that she missed me and was too sad to talk in person and that she need time to process what happened. I rolled my eyes at the text and said whatever. Toward the end of the month (November 19th to exact) she reaches out to me telling me about how sorry she is how awful of a friend she was. I vented my frustrations and she said apologized and alluded to wanting yet another chance. I said ok and we planned to meet on December 22nd.             A few days before December 22nd, she texts me saying that the 22nd didn't work for her. She tried to place the blame on me by saying that I knew that she had job training that day and that I should've picked another day. I went off, She begs, I say whatever. Sometime goes by and we talk again and I explain everything that is on my mind. I tell her that its cool to be busy but its also important to make time for the people in her life. She didn't really respond because I guess it was finals week on her end. I told her that I would always be there for her and I wished her the best of luck.          On New Years she texted me telling me that she had been thinking about me and she wished me a Happy New Year. I did the same. A few days later she texts me saying that she bought me a gift in Korea (where she had been visiting) and I said ok? I was a little irritated because I know that it was just another nice-nice sappy guilt trip manipulation ploy. We settled for meeting up on Saturday. however after thinking about it, I texted her today and told her that meeting up isn't a good idea. I told her that while she is a very sweet person and that I appreciated the gift, I do not trust her. I told her that I have since moved on and healed from the situation. I included that if she wanted to speak on the phone on Saturday that we could but outside of that I would not feel comfortable meeting up and hanging out. She texted me back a little short saying ""Oh ok"" and she asked if she could text me later. I said sorry and told her to take care.         *Am I wrong? I feel a little guilty for how messy this entire thing has been but Im over feeling used and manipulated. She thinks that if she ""gives"" me gifts and or cries and begs for me to give her another chance that I give in. I mean it this time.. Ive gone back on my word so many times with her because of guilt and not wanting to seem like a bitch. She doesnt have many friends and I was kind of her should but she always had a hard time returning the favor. Should I meet up with her and accept the gift? Or should I just let sleep dogs lie???*  ",0,cut best friend flake want wrong declining tldr cut best friend year flakey unreliable summer try guilt trip taking back bought gift visiting korea wanted saturday said ok sent text morning declining gift offer feel guilty wrong long story detailed friend friend high school ended friendship summer giving numerous chance year long story shortish word came meeting up super inconsistent really reached convenient her too busy change plan hang others flake not show went separate college different town meeting hard hanging regularly pretty difficult reach doing initiate hang session make plan meet month advance week planned day flake out while started calling beg exclaiming change did text text back called hard day school rushed phone help advice center ready listen ask help bail minute scheduling conflict failing think ahead asked pick airport asked time sure reassured able to couple day day supposed pick up call talking circle tell not it broke not really afford lyft luckily able reach dad summer thing got worse turned tried time link out bailed time time bailed guess forgot needed pick aunt airport second time date night plan boyfriend continued persist teaching drive did not think let know going cancel instead ghosted week blame fact busy text me september it deleted facebook blocked number added week later blocked her feeling bad november reached time talk thing through said missed sad talk person need time process happened rolled eye text said whatever end month november th exact reach telling sorry awful friend wa vented frustration said apologized alluded wanting chance said ok planned meet december nd day december nd text saying nd did not work her tried place blame saying knew job training day picked day went off begs say whatever go talk explain mind tell cool busy important make time people life did not really respond guess final week end told wished best luck new year texted telling thinking wished happy new year did same day later text saying bought gift korea where visiting said ok little irritated know just nicenice sappy guilt trip manipulation ploy settled meeting saturday thinking it texted today told meeting not good idea told sweet person appreciated gift not trust her told moved healed situation included wanted speak phone saturday outside not feel comfortable meeting hanging out texted little short saying oh ok asked text later said sorry told care am wrong feel little guilty messy entire thing im feeling used manipulated think give gift cry begs chance in mean time ive gone word time guilt not wanting like bitch doesnt friend kind hard time returning favor meet accept gift just let sleep dog lie
"I'm a 23 year old female who has suffered from depression for the last 3 years. I remember having bouts of it in high school, hating myself and thinking i was ugly and worthless, but it generally passed and things got better. Then all of a sudden when i was 20, i just started crying constantly, feeling out of control, wanting to dig a hole and bury myself, not knowing what to do with myself, feeling hysterical. I went on medication after a few months, and things improved, but it's something i still deal with every day.  I am at university full time, as well as working part time, and just feel like i'm constantly on the edge of going insane. I just moved to a new city, and feel so lonely, wanting attention but i feel like no one's interested. Worst of all, i miss so much university (because i can't get out of bed in the morning) that my tutors regard me as a bad student, which makes me feel so bad, because i know i'm smarter than most of the people in our class. I just want everyone to know i'm not lazy and boring, i just feel like my body is made of lead and i have no energy and no drive to get up in the morning. I have just started seeing a psychologist and she is really great, but it's so expensive i have to work extra shifts at work just to manage, which makes me even more stressed out!  I don't want to take time off university because i took last year off and it made me feel worse. I really love my course and it's pretty much the only thing that gives me joy ...  if only i could get out of bed to go!  i'm so angry at myself, my life wasn't meant to be like this...

"God giveth and God taketh away, but lately he seems to just be taking from me. I'm tired of it all now. A little over a year ago my Grandfather who lived with us passed away. About 6 months ago my mother passed away. A week ago my father went into the hospital to have open heart surgery done on him, and today he came back and is definitely looking worse for wear. For the time being he can't do anything physical, can't drive, and just looks like he's in pain, and is talking about probably retiring.  Meanwhile in my life i'm struggling between choosing to go off to college or getting a full-time job. Only just a week ago I was getting ready to start to apply to FAFSA in preparation for actually starting college this year -- now with recent developments i'm not sure if that's even a viable option. I'll probably need to stay home and help out by getting a full-time job since both me and my brother are reliant on my dad financially, and my brother is already in college.  I really don't know what I want to do or what I even can do. Add onto more shallow but personal reasons for me to feel down, like the fact that I have no social life to speak of and honestly it's enough to make me seriously consider suicide.

"I want to pay off my debt then kill myself. I came from a really poor family, worked hard during primary and secondary school. Got a scholarship for college which paid me 10k a year as well as covering my school fees. Gave parents the money, it paid for the bills as well as my siblings's school fees. Thought life was good, studying what i love. However, i got bullied until i cant take it anymore and requested a change of class, the school rejected my request. I then requested to take a semester off school, but the contract for the scholarship states that i have to complete school by 3 years or the contract will be terminated. Failed a module and i have to extend my time in college by a year, which caused my scholarship to be terminated. Which in turn placed me in a 30k debt. Now, i don't have money to pay for school, so i had to leave. Im out without any qualifications except for a secondary school cert, with the organisation that offered me the scholarship requesting 1k per month for installments.    I've always looked forward to my dream job, i was so close, i volunteer every weekend to get experience from that job. Now it feels like everything is taken from me. I appealed to have my scholarship reinstated 3 times, explaining the issues that i had, giving them the medical reports from my doctors, bringing up the volunteer work i did. But on the latest attempt, i got a call saying that they never planned to accept my appeal. It really feels like everything is taken from me. I feel like just working to pay off my debt so as to not burden my family as the debtors will go for them if i die now.

"I can't forgive her, no matter how hard I try I'm focusing on improving myself and working through repressed emotions from a difficult upbringing, namely with my grandmother. I am currently staying with her but thankfully I am already making plans and taking steps to move out within the next 5 months or so. I have stayed on and off the last several years and before I became an adult, I lived with her from birth.  We have a complicated relationship. Although I appreciate the things she has done for me - and she often tries to make me happy by buying me something or getting me food I like, etc. - I can't seem to let go of the deep seated anger and resentment I feel toward her for the mistakes she has made and how she has also been cruel to me.  I understand no one is perfect; adults aren't always ideal role models to kids. But my grandmother had a unique way of mentally and emotionally hurting me as a child. She would often act like I was her partner in crime [in the absence of a husband] and made me feel responsible for her happiness. She would try to talk bad about my mom so I wouldn't favor her [my mom wasn't living with us and had mental issues]. She would give me the cold shoulder, or say things to incite anxiety and guilt in me if I happened to act like I wanted to spend more time with my mom or got in a bad mood.   It confuses me because I think deep in my heart I DO want a happy relationship with her...or maybe I try so hard out of guilt, knowing she has tried to make it up to me, I guess? But every so often I implode and I tell her how much she bothers me or even that I hate her. Sometimes even hearing the sound of her voice is enough to make me want to scream in irritation. I feel terrible about it and like I'm a monster. I always feel guilty when she tells me 'you're the only one who is really special to me, you're the only one I have.' [She doesn't have a close relationship with mom, her other D, or siblings.] Maybe I get angry because to me, this doesn't feel normal, it feels like I'm being trapped.   I'm seeing a DBT therapist but we aren't making progress about this ... yet. I just wish this was not my life. I'm not looking for solutions per say, just sympathy or someone who also understands.

Probably an understatement considering our only interactions were him calling drunk and calling me dirty names since the age of 14.

Well fast forward 6 years later he's in the hospital for nearly a month and no one tells me, not even his sister who I am in contact daily with. Finally he passes away last thursday. He was intubated and couldn't speak for most of his hospital stay. He was 39. I asked his side of the family why nobody told me he was in the hospital or why nobody told me died the day it happened. Their reasoning? I had vented at a few points saying I wished he was dead (normally after he would call me drunk and call me a whore and talk shit on my mother who raised me since birth). I am also not invited to the service. Should I feel duped? Should I feel cheated out of a chance to say goodbye even though we weren't on the best of terms? Because his family and girlfriend sure as hell made it clear i don't even deserve to grieve. All i wanted was a relationship with him and all I got was name calling and him taking me and my mom told court over the $200 he had to pay in child support each month. I wasn't very nice to him, I tried to be.. But he made it so hard. So was it  really they're call to say I couldn't see him. Or am I right to feel this way..",0,bio dad died family didnt tell day later close probably understatement considering interaction calling drunk calling dirty name age believe started sent letter wanting relationship him just wanted know dad not super close relationship wanted one fast forward year later hospital nearly month tell me not sister contact daily with finally pass away thursday intubated not speak hospital stay asked family told hospital told died day happened reasoning vented point saying wished dead normally drunk whore talk shit mother raised birth not invited service feel duped feel cheated chance say goodbye not best term family girlfriend sure hell clear not deserve grieve wanted relationship got calling taking mom told court pay child support month not nice him tried be hard really say not him right feel way

"I don't want to exist anymore My girlfriend has left me a couple of months ago, saying she doesn't love me anymore but without explaining me why. I then tried to ask her out one last time, not to come back together, just to clarify what happened. She doesn't want to see me and when I write to her she answers back just so that I can't say she's ignoring me and she continuously provokes me to get into an argument. I really had trusted her, and she had done the same, until a couple of months ago (she's always told me I was the only person who she actually trusted, even after we split up) so I feel like I've been used and then thrown away like an object. I then realized I'm not good at all at socializing, that she was the only truly important person in my life (except for other two friends of mine, who have their own lives and whom I don't want to annoy too much with my problems) and that I will probably never know anyone else in my life.  Every day I feel like I'm bothering other people and I'm not doing anything good, and probably this is the reason nobody wants to become my friend.

"My family is breaking apart (need help) So im a teenager aged only 14 , i live in Greece, my family was having issues, (my parents) started ~ 2015 and the real reason causing it was that my mother is working at my school as a cook , and a guy who finished his university ( i dont know what's called) of cooking  , he came to the school to work as head-chef , my father paranoia began at that time , he posted on facebook a post from my mother's profile tagging the cook and typing like this guy is my new boyfriend and stuff like that , my mother would never do that to my father, my father always had side-chicks beside her and he was being disloyal even at their marriage, also that head-chef was about 22 years old and my mother is 40-43 ... well lets go the main thing !

"Hey, My name is Jonathan. I'm 23 years old. I'm a senior in college hoping to be through very VERY soon. I went through a really rough depression era starting around the age of 15 and lasting till I was 21. It started to get a little better when I got into college, but then severely accelerated throughout the years. I took a year off from school to work and basically to get help, which I did. I found out a lot of my depression was cognitive... thinking negatively about myself. When I was growing up, I was a real shy guy. I think some of that though has turned into a social anxiety issue, but I didn't have a great social. I still don't, but once I got help, the psychologist I saw really helped me get past the negative thinking, but I still have really tightly bound emotional issues from time to time that tend to really upset me. It's taken pieces of my personality and completely do a 180. Part of my depression was that I was co-dependent. Now I'm really completely independent.

" I’ve started attending this yoga class at the Fitness Center on Wednesday nights. I figured it would be a good way to gain more flexibility & strength. I have to admit, it’s a lot harder than I anticipated and that kinda pisses me off! Here I thought it would be a nice “break” from my regular workout routine in the middle of the week. I'm pretty flexible and since it’s not straight-up cardio, I assumed it would be easy.  Not so much. It’s actually pretty challenging to continually switch  ; hold all of those poses. And it turns out I’m not as flexible as I thought I was. I’m particularly horrible at the balancing portion of the class. I look like I stopped off somewhere for happy hour before showing up. However, I do enjoy the challenge so I plan to keep going. I just know it will take some time before I feel any sort of euphoria from it.

"Friend threatened to ruin my therapists life over a joke. OK so I had a bit of a blur of boundaries with my therapist. It wasn't a big deal. Therapy ended and we became kind of distant friends who still chat via phone calls and texting.  However I told my friend that my therapist fancied me etc whilst things were happening. I told her to promise to keep it a secret even if I died. Nothing happened between me and my therapist and we never slept together, but things were a bit... Weird i guess. Some of the stuff my therapist said could make her lose her job.  Anyway I pranked my friend today by photoshopping a fake conversation between me and my college tutor. In the convo I told them my friend referred to him as ""daddy nick"" behind his back. It was merely a joke and I didn't really message the tutor any of this.  She freaked out when I sent her the photoshopped convo. And her immediate response was: ""I'm going to ruin your therapists life for this!"" I told her it was a joke and a prank. She demanded evidence which i gave her... She then acted as though things were fine when they weren't.  She said if I ever do anything like that again she'll ruin my therapists life.

"Zoloft made me fly off the handle I have episodes of clinical depression that last a few weeks alternating with episodes of being euphoric, having so much energy, and thinking I am the greatest person in the world and I have superpowers. It’s awesome but has issues of its own because I tend to make poor choices, act conceited/rude without realizing it, and sometimes get angry.  I was on Zoloft for a short time (age 11-12) and it made me a little less depressed but caused me to do horrible things impulsively, act spoiled and stuck up, and have frequent fits of rage. I attempted suicide within the first month of taking meds. I developed anorexia, made poor sexual and financial decisions, and was fired from my Saturday job as a babysitter because I was yelling at the kids, teaching them how to swear and bragging about it to other teachers, and trying to flirt with the children’s fathers. At school I told everyone I had superpowers and raged at them when they said that my superpowers were not real. I had arguments with my parents and pulled out a knife to threaten them at one point. I had a boyfriend but was still flirting with other boys constantly including my teachers.

" I finally gave in. I spent six years in a Theatre department (I wasn't the most devoted student) and somehow avoided Karaoke, but last night I made my way down to the Bandana Brewery in lovely Mankato for Tuesday night karaoke.

I mean, I don't want to hear the Dixie Chicks sing a Dixie Chicks song; why would I want to hear tone-deaf drunkards sing a Dixie Chicks song.

"I think letters are a wonderful way to communicate. That way you don't say anything without thinking about it first. I wasn't clear if your mother actually read the letter or not. If she hasn't, I might suggest approaching the letter with just the first issue of the way she treats you (without the father issue) in one letter. That might open dialogue and allow you guys to focus on fixing that first. I understand your fear of authority figures. When I was that age (I'm 31 now) I couldn't talk to anyone of authority. My mom, who was shy herself had to do that kind of stuff for me. Could another one of your relatives go with you to take your drivers test? Nana or Sonny who you mentioned in the letter? If it helps to hear, I did get over my fear of authority figures and sometimes I go overboard and challenge them (to make up for lost time?). I never had psychotherapy, but I wish I had. So don't discount it, nip it in the bud if you are able to. One other question I have is...is your mother ALWAYS this way or does she show moments of tenderness, sympathy or interest in your life? I think that if you've seen the mom in her in the past, it sounds like she has some internal problems that she takes out on you, but have nothing to do with you. Don't worry about how you should be at this age...everyone has their own time clock inside. If we were all the same, this would be a very very boring world. You sound like an interesting, thoughtful man.

" Well, here I am. I decided to start a blog. Now, I am not entirely sure why I decided this for a number of reasons. 1. I am rubbish at writing journals/diaries/most things, so this is not going to be very good 2. I don’t really know anyone on this thing so no one is actually going to read it, but I guess it might be therapeutic...or something 3. I live a relatively boring life, so there is not going to be that much to write in here.  So apart from all them, this seemed like a good idea at the time!  A few days ago I came back from a holiday in America. America is awesome. If you ever get a chance to go, you should. And if you’ve already been then... go again! I had a simply marvellous time! Visited both New York and Orlando... had to go to Disneyland. new York is like no where else, I stupidly thought London was a big, busy, over-crowded city, but it is nothing next New York City. I am not sure if I would want to return, as i have now done the whole statue of liberty, show on Broadway, baseball game thing... but saying that I do think I would like to go back with a bunch of mates and just go crazy! Florida was... well... hot. And heat does not like me much. Therefore I tried to avoid it by standing under lots of fans. Despite this, I still managed to get heat rash and a severe case of sun burn. I think the sun does this to me on purpose. I also discovered that universal studios is better than Disney land...

"A Question About Honesty in Communication My friend recently graduated from Business school with a degree after 3 or 4 years. However, she continually asks me very simple, basic business questions that many non-business majors would know, stuff that I would think would've been covered over the first few classes. She's originally from a different country and still struggles a bit with English yet she went to school in Canada where all the courses were taught in English. The way I see it, if there was that much of a language barrier, she wouldn't have been able to pass. Even if she had gotten help with her studies, she still would have needed to retain this knowledge long enough to pass her exams, which weren't that long ago. The only thing I can fathom is that she had other people doing her work for her and taking her exams but I don't want to believe that and, besides, it's a bit of a stretch.    As well, she currently has a mentor who's supposedly helping her conduct business research, yet she still messages me with questions about assignments they've given her, saying she doesn't understand basic stuff. I even told her that if she doesn't understand what her mentor is assigning her, she should be forthright and tell them, otherwise they wouldn't be able to fully help her. She agreed but I noticed she's still asking me the same questions insteading of contacting her mentor.    Anyone have any insight into this? I've brought up similar things with her that I felt didn't make sense or were inconsistent but she's rarely honest, preferring to answer dismissively or cryptically. Not sure how to proceed from here.",0,question honesty communication friend recently graduated business school degree year however continually asks simple basic business question nonbusiness major know stuff think covered class originally different country struggle bit english went school canada course taught english way it language barrier not able pas gotten help study needed retain knowledge long pas exam not long ago thing fathom people doing work taking exam not want believe and besides bit stretch well currently mentor supposedly helping conduct business research message question assignment given her saying doe not understand basic stuff told doe not understand mentor assigning her forthright tell them not able fully help her agreed noticed asking question insteading contacting mentor insight this brought similar thing felt did not make sense inconsistent rarely honest preferring answer dismissively cryptically not sure proceed here
"How to Make Friends When No One Likes You A little background, in 4th grade my teacher would encourage bullying me (she got fired the end of the year) and I pretty much grew up taught it was okay to be bullied, so I never learned to stand for myself. That obviously left a lot of scars, and my depression (diagnosed in 7th grade) makes me isolate myself a lot.   I don't want to sound like I'm looking for sympathy, and sorry if I am.   But now I have mere months left in the school year of my senior year and I still have absolutely no friends. I am friendly and I try to be as outgoing as I can, it feels like everyone is keeping me at an arm's distance though.   Is it me? It must be, I don't know why but something about me just makes others hate me. I'll ask how someone's day is going and often the reply is just a short ""pretty good"" and then that's it. I refuse to beg for friendship or to force anyone to talk to me so when they walk away or leave I'll just accept it, wave and say ""see ya around"" or etc.   How do I get people to be my friend though? I don't smell, I am ugly but I try to cover that up best I can with makeup. I just want to feel like I belong somewhere with someone.

"Can people stop telling me that hiking and exercise is the magical cure? It just frustrates me so much, and continues the perpetual cycle of ""well if I can't make myself better through such simple actions I must be even more of a failure than I realised"".  I appreciate the science behind it, releasing endorphins yada yada, but if I can't bring myself to drink water or get out of bed how am I supposed to go for a jog? If I'm so insecure about myself why would running and jiggling in front of everyone to imagine their sneery comments going to make me feel better?  Where do I find the energy to go for a hike when being awake for three hours makes my body physically ache?  I get it, it's helpful for a lot of people but telling me to go get my yoga pants on and be at one with nature will not cure a thing and by repeating that useless mantra you're making me worse.  Rant over, I'm going back to bed.  Edit: a few people telling me if I exercise I will lose weight and feel better about myself. I only need to try it apparently. On the advice of my doctor, I have tried it, even walking. I do walk, every day, no matter how I feel. I also don't need to lose weight and being overweight is not the reason I am depressed (because I'm not overweight). Just saying to stop preaching the exercise mantra as if it's the only thing that could possibly fix what is a very real mental illness that has nothing to do with how often I move, flex or jump. My point is that it's not working.",1,people stop telling hiking exercise magical cure just frustrates much continues perpetual cycle well make better simple action failure realised appreciate science it releasing endorphin yada yada bring drink water bed supposed jog insecure running jiggling imagine sneery comment going make feel better energy hike awake hour make body physically ache it helpful lot people telling yoga pant nature not cure thing repeating useless mantra making worse rant over going bed edit people telling exercise lose weight feel better myself need try apparently advice doctor tried it walking walk day matter feel not need lose weight overweight not reason depressed because not overweight just saying stop preaching exercise mantra thing possibly fix real mental illness move flex jump point not working
" But there are a couple of things I've been thinking about.  Does it make me a bad person that I want to just quit my alumni group?  Here's the problem -- I'm the president of our chapter.  I have been for about a year and a half.  But it's not like I volunteered for it . . . or at least not without a bit of arm twisting from the ex-president.  And now I can't find anyone to arm twist myself.  And I want out!!  There's just not enough time in the day to dream up events, organize them, send out a mass email announcing them, reply to responses, etc.  Then I have to actually show up at the event -- early to get seats -- and talk to people.  Well, the talk to people part isn't horrible.  The showing up early is the one that always kills me.  I have to show up early enough to ensure enough seats for everyonee who's coming (half of which probably didn't RSVP), but late enough that I don't have to fight off the waitor for TOO long with promises of a coming party.  Uchhkk.  Let's see . . . what else.  Oh yeah -- I finally found a new apartment!  I'm pretty excited.  It's a one bedroom, so I'll be living by myself for the first time ever.  That's pretty nifty in some aspects . . . I can clean at my own pace (and only clean up after myself).  I can invite people over (or not) at my own discression.  I can decorate exactly as I like.  It'll be like heaven.  Except . . . I'm hoping I don't become a hermit.  Someone at work today joked that I'll be a cat lady.  I won't buy a cat -- I promise!!!  Hopefully it won't be so bad.  My current roommate will still be relatively close (she and her fiancee are moving in together).  My cousin will moving (with his wife) to a condo VERY close to my new place -- that'll be pretty nifty, cause I think we might be good friends -- we've never lived close enough to try before, but I've always enjoyed hanging out with him (and his wife) when I've gotten the chance.  Oh -- and I'll moving close to some friends-of-a-friend that I'm decently good friends with, too (and that I've always wanted to be better friends with).  So hopefully it'll all turn out well.

"Painfully lonely and spiraling into the worst depression I've ever been in I recently moved to a new city for a job after college. I have a few friends at work, but they're a group of guys that I don't have a lot in common with and we don't really talk outside of the occasional work conversation. They're nice and I'm happy to be friends with them, but it's hard for me to really get to know them because they do ""guy stuff"" on the weekends (like sitting around drinking and playing FIFA) that I'm totally not interested in/they don't bother inviting me to. Other than that, I have a few online friends that I'm growing increasingly dependent on for social interaction which is really unhealthy. I notice myself getting more paranoid with them about not responding, and I bug them way too much to the point where I know I would definitely be annoyed if I was them. Also they're not very supportive (probably the opposite) but it's not their fault -- they're just causal online friends that shouldn't have to cater to my current host of mental problems.  I'm totally alone. My family and college friends live 4 hours away. I have pretty bad social anxiety and I'm terrified of every new social interaction I have. I work 9 hours and come home to my empty apartment and watch netflix to escape my own life, every day. I sometimes hear from my college friends about all of the fun they're still having together and it honestly brings me to tears that I have such a pathetic lonely life now. I've never been able to have a ""normal"" social life -- it takes me forever to make close friends, and then even at my best I only have a handful of good friends at a time. I don't enjoy going out every weekend or the other obvious ways of making friends, and that wouldn't work now anyway since I would NEVER go alone and I don't have a single person that I could ask to go with me.   When I was a freshman in college I had this same problem -- absolutely zero friends and living in a totally different city. It was the worst depression I've ever been through. I had dozens and dozens of online friends at the time (now we've all lost touch and moved on from the RPG we were playing) that helped ease the loneliness, and I eventually joined a student club and finally made friends after like a year of going. There's not really anything I can ""join"" like that in a non-college town... I've been applying for a few volunteering things, they haven't started but I'm doubtful that it will be a good way to meet people.   I honestly just need ONE person to talk to. Anyone. I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm not a complete weirdo or anything and I know I can have meaningful friendships (just 90% of them have been online, and now I can't even seem to make any fucking online friends either), but I live the loneliest life of anyone I've ever known or heard of. I've never been serious about suicide, but recently that's changed and it's becoming something I could actually picture myself doing. I'm a long way from that but at this point I don't see anything getting better and I practically cry myself to sleep some days and have to hide emotional breakdowns at work after eating lunch alone.   Does anyone have any advice for meeting new people in a non-college town? Anyone else having the same problem?

"My bottom line concern is that I'm suddenly afraid of men. When a man speaks to me in public I'm suspicious of his intentions, and when a man was openly flirting with me two days ago I left the store and then became afraid that he might follow me home and had to go sleep with my 4 year old in his room with the door locked that night. I'm even nervous and suspicious of men I've known, like spouses of friends. Background. My husband is in the military and has been deployed. He's been gone since September and since the beginning I've had a fear of being in the house alone at night and it has progressed to this. I'm a fairly sane person for the most part. I dealt with some PPD when our son was born and my OBGYN gave me Xanax which was NO GOOD. My PCP put me on Lexapro which worked out just fine and I weaned off of it about a year and a half ago. I know this behavior is abnormal, but I can't seem to stop it. Can I have a little push in the right direction??

"I am always wrong.. I got married with a wrong man.  I have been married for 5 years. I have a baby who is still a month. I realized that i chose the wrong person as husband. He ruined my life.

And i have helped it. But he forgot that.. I want to leave him but i don't have money and i have a baby.. And I'm in different country.. No one is by my side. I cut myself almost every day. I have stopped it since i was 20. But situations make me do that. I would never wear short sleeve again. Too much scars. But i don't regret to cut myself. Because that's the only way to make me live.

"Are friendship ultimatums a good or bad thing? I have this friend who've I've been friends with for about 7 years. She moved across the country and is depressed for not knowing anyone she can be friends with. She's been making me feel bad about not going there to visit her. I've told her several times, I'm broke and have school obligations. Every time we talk, she brings up how she misses me and just needs a hug, and have someone (me) brush her hair, and hang out  with her.      Recently, I've found out that she feels there's an inequity in our friendship over the past year; because I haven't gone to visit her. I personally feel I've been there for her and her child whenever she needed me and dropped everything and go see her whenever her and her ex-husband and ex-best friend would have a fight.     About two months ago, my S.O. made a bad joke and she ended up lashing out on him and making a comment about a subject that I told her in confidence, and ended up hurting me as a result. We talked about it, and tried to go back to normal. But, I realized, that I'm still hurt by her comment and told her that. She then says she's going through a lot right now and can't deal with me going back and forth on my feelings. So she said I need to ""figure my shit out"" and let her know if we can move past this or end our friendship.    I've been doing some thinking and I'm torn on whether or not to try to get over this feeling of betrayal, or just completely end the friendship all together.

" I've got to go watch my favorite television shows, so I'll be brief.    As a conservative, I'm more than a little fed up with the liberal bias in the media. Disgusted isn't really the right word-I'm disgusted with the blatant anti-Americanism of the flag-burning war protestors, I'm disgusted with the self-absorbed corruption at the UN-but the media bias...it can best be compared to a child singing an annoying song, incessantly, over and over again. They're AWARE that they're injecting bias into their news. They're AWARE that it's wrong. However, they're not going to stop doing it...because on one level, the annoying song-singing child enjoys singing the song, on another, it enjoys annoying the people around it. Eh, that's the best comparison I can come up with on such short notice.   Perusing the internet a couple of years back, I came across this wonder of wonders: THE BLOG. Conservatives around the nation had taken opportunity of this new miracle of technology to protest the liberal media. Good for them.   Since then, both the media and the celebrities around the nation have turned up the heat on their criticism of Bush, all the while proclaiming that there was a 'chill wind' of repression silencing them. Such sheer pretentiousness on their part served to give me a headache for a few hours, but nothing more.   However, they've begun to go to far. They've gone beyond the realm of 'bias' into the realm of 'propaganda.' I realized this after I was able to deconstruct the basis of a Time magazine article ('How we got Homeland Security wrong) with a calculator, access to google, and no more than five minutes of my own time. When something like this happens-when a trusted and widely read magazine starts putting out bullshit that can be disproved with eighth-grade research and math skills...well, things have gotten pretty bad.   Instead of sitting around and bitching about it, I've decided to throw my weight into the fight, by starting this blog. Whenever I can, I'll point out liberal media innaccuracies. Whenever I want to, I'll write opinion pieces.   However, unlike the mainstream media, I'll be honest with you. This Blog will be replete with right-wing bias, ranging from moderate to, as the media would put it, 'extreme.'   Thank you.

"It's become a personality trait Depression has become part of my identity. As much as I'd like to say it doesn't define me, it really does, it controls my life enough to debilitate my every day experiences.

I knew I felt very depressed with that friendship though she never really did something bad like other people post on here. It was more like she did something I was not okay with and she never really reached out to me ( months). She was my best friend and someone I love and care about. I know I made my mistakes as well. She texted me to reach out and I talked to normally to her didn't get angry/say anything angry... just small talk...   Can we ever be close friends again and how?

"I don't know if I am allowed to feel this way I don't have many friends to start with. I mean I do, but when I count close friends, I nearly have none as I am slowly starting to lose them. I have great friends, amazing friends that were always there for me in the past, but I just don't feel any of that anymore. And yes, I know I should be considerate that they are people that have a life of their own with school and family and all their homework, but I feel in a way neglect. I asked them for once if they wanted to hang out, but they reply with ""sorry I'm busy with homework"" but then I see that they were making a costume and having a photoshoot with some other friend which would have took hours of work. I know I shouldn't say anything and I should be forunate that they still consider me their prized friend however, I feel neglected. I feel as if they don't even care or want to even care about me anymore because I'm the one always chatting in the chat, but I get short replies back once in the blue moon. It makes me feel like they just stopped because they found someone else.   On top of that, they calmed they were sick and I do believe that. They actually had initially told me that they wanted to give me a present for Christmas which is rare because they never really give me things (once on a blue moon maybe) and I only give gifts to them for their birthday. But now since they are sick, I have a feeling I'm going to be told ""no, sorry I am sick and need to relax after finals"" when they always go out with their other friends for these occasions no matter what. I want to say this again, but I feel that it is not right that I am feeling disappointed and neglected because a person is allowed to do what they want. I am not not allowed to tell them what to do as they have their own life and I wouldn't like that. But please, my request is may I have some advice about or further insight about what you guys could possibly be seeing in this situation?

Until July, I was on medication with SSRI (selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors) which helped me a lot but never completely and then for some months none. Now I consulted another doctor and decided to try with different medicine called Remeron. But my question might sound not related .... I somehow think that contraceptive pills (antibaby pills) that I used somehow contributed to my ""state of art"". I used them for 3 months because my gynecologist advised ( she thought that I had some problem with hormones; she did not even check my blood!) and when I stopped with this ""therapy"" I experienced ""total breakdown of the system"". Now, this pills somehow simulate pregnancy, and there is phenomenon of postpartum depression (the baby blues) and the women over 50 quite often develop depressions (hormones again!) ......!!!

"Getting motivated to get help I was diagnosed with a mood disorder and PTSD ~1.5 years ago. I was getting help for a while but I dropped out of school and moved out of state so I just haven't been able to do that in the past year. I live with (and mooch off of) an SO but I've been fairly isolated for about 6 months. I've been doing online school but had to drop my classes this semester when I started working. Now all I do is this stupid part-time job. I should probably quit because it makes me incredibly suicidal. It's all so superficial. It doesn't feel beneath me but I really just don't mesh with it.   Anyway. Health insurance. I can't figure out how to fill out the income stuff. A hospital near me has people that can help but I just can't find the motivation to even call them. It's like I'm trying to prevent myself from getting help. It's not even just psychiatric reasons that I want health insurance. I have a referral for a neurologist. I've been having memory issues, twitches, etc. I know I won't go without insurance. I probably could stand to get on birth control and check out some other persistent problems too but a) I know I won't be taken seriously and b) the only thing I genuinely like about myself is my mind so that's the priority.  I'm not completely not trying. I'll take St. John's Wort if I'm persistently suicidal but it doesn't help with motivation. I've been going to support groups. I'll ""decide"" to be motivated but end up collapsed and sobbing before I get out of the door. Play music, leave my phone behind so I don't get sidetracked. Tell people what I'm doing so I feel pressured to keep my word. Incentivize with promises of fast food, caffeine, or chocolate. I dunno what else to do. I can't even tell if it's laziness or depression or something else.

" Well, I took Hoss to get neutered this morning. Poor thing, he was so excited it makes me think he has no idea what is to come. He was like a wild thing this morning, playing and running around this morning. The ride in the car was great! We were stuck trying to find a place to get across to the vet's office through all the traffic, and he just watched all the cars and trucks go by. He really loves to watch the cars and truck moving.  Then we got there, and I had to take him over to the side to go potty before we went into the office. He was a total spaz there! I could hardly contain him and in fact, he got loose of his collar and scared a poor little shih-tzu. They called someone from the back to come get him once I put the collar back on and I appologized to the little dog that was just shaking.  Anyway, he goes under the knife between 11 and 2 today, and I can call to check on him later. Then tomorrow he gets a bath before his daddy goes to pick him up. He'll be like a whole new dog!  Here's a little pic of him when he was a baby...that seems so long ago.  He's only about 7lbs there, but he weighed 62lbs last time he went to the vet.  He's 9 months old now and so handsome!

"Feeling Good is an excellent book. I have re-read a few times when I've felt the need. If you are looking at something for anxiety and panic, I suggest Mastering Anxiety and Panic revision III (map-3) by David Barlow. I suffered from anxiety, panic attacks and agoraphobia from the time I was 12 until last year...that's 30 years. Nothing had ever helped until I found a therapist that uses that program. A different way of looking at things and I have to say that I worked miracles for me. I am driving, flying, going to concerts, sporting events...things I haven't done for over 20 years. I NEVER thought I could get better and only went because my boyfriend of 8 years was honest with me and told me that he didn't know if he could spend the rest of his life going every place alone. That was a wake up call for me and to my surprise, I found that I COULD do it. I still have my depression and I am endlessly working on being medicated correctly for that.... all of you know how that is. You can buy just the workbook www.oup.com (Oxford University Press).

My friend knows I really like this guy and she start flirting with him and started hugging him for no reason and I ended up crying because this was so upsetting to me. I confronted her about it and she said she didn't mean so I forgave her. About 4 months ago I got a boyfriend and she started flirting with him and he didn't even care, he flirted back at her. and I went home crying and I decided to break up with the guy and stopped being friends with her for good because I realized that she was flirting with that guy I liked.

"Are you a bisexual, pansexual, or queer parent? Hi! I am a graduate student in the Sociology Department at the University of California, Davis. I am conducting research on the relationship between sexual orientation and parenting strategies. There is currently a lack of research on bisexual, pansexual, and other non-monosexual identities, particularly as they relate to the family. I would love for you to help me fill this gap of knowledge by participating in my survey.   Participation in this research includes taking a survey about your sexuality, your family history, and your thoughts on parenting, which will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. You may also volunteer to participate in a follow-up interview, which will take approximately one hour to complete.   Thank you so much!

"I've really hit a new low I cannot believe how depressed I am right now, I am just imploding. I got fired from yet another job for being incompetent as usual. Usually I'm pretty good at bouncing back but this job just broke something inside me. I'm a damn failure. Three attempts at college. Flunked out after the first year. That's ok, college isn't for everyone. Try a bunch of min wage jobs. Get fired or quit with in the first month or two. I can't do damn thing.  I have no motivation to do anything at all anymore. I used to clock around 3-4 hours a day gaming because it was something I genuinely enjoyed. I've gotten 30 minutes in an entire damn week. I literally just can't muster the strength to want to do it. I've been pulling away from people because it's just exhausting to talk to them. I literally just get tired after five minutes of conversation. It's insane. We'll barely be through the how's your day been going before I already want to go somewhere else because it's so draining.  I've hit a complete rock wall in therapy. I tell my therapist nearly all of this shit and she helps me as best she can but there's only so much she's able to do. She has no magic way of instilling me with motivation. Like... to put it into perspective. I stared at a wall for 2 hours today. Because I just was to tired to anything else. 2 hours! I wasn't thinking about anything. I wasn't being bored. I just don't have motivation to do anything!  But what's worse is the moment I start thinking again is the moment all the sadness washes over me. It's like I'm in the middle of a vast, dark ocean and can't find shore. I swim and I swim and I swim but salvation is just nowhere to be seen. And I'm beginning to grow tired.  I have no future ahead of me. Nothing to look forward too. I go through thousands of career tests and applications and all I see is that I'm either not interested enough or not good enough for any career. And I can't simply work for money. Money in and of itself just isn't good enough for me to work at a job I hate or am completely uninterested in. That's the strain of these minimum wage jobs, some of them I've had to quit because they've literally made me suicidal.  I'm so lost right now. The world looks like a very dark place where I have to suffer in agony just to get by. I'm so tired of fighting. I'm so tired of trying. I'm just. So. Tired. It has been a very long time since I've been this low. I feel like I'm doomed. Like this is all the happiness I'll ever be afforded. That even if I get the job of my dreams and all the money I could possibly want, I will always have a big, dark cloud hanging over my head.  Everything hurts and I hate everything about life right now. I wish I could just fall asleep and stay in my dreams.",1,really hit new low believe depressed right now just imploding got fired job incompetent usual usually pretty good bouncing job just broke inside me damn failure attempt college flunked year ok college not everyone try bunch min wage job fired quit month two damn thing motivation anymore used clock hour day gaming genuinely enjoyed gotten minute entire damn week literally just muster strength want it pulling away people just exhausting talk them literally just tired minute conversation insane barely day going want draining hit complete rock wall therapy tell therapist nearly shit help best able do magic way instilling motivation like perspective stared wall hour today just tired else hour not thinking anything not bored just not motivation anything worse moment start thinking moment sadness wash me like middle vast dark ocean shore swim swim swim salvation just seen beginning grow tired future ahead me look forward too thousand career test application not interested not good career simply work money money just not good work job hate completely uninterested in strain minimum wage job quit literally suicidal lost right now world look like dark place suffer agony just by tired fighting tired trying just so tired long time low feel like doomed like happiness afforded job dream money possibly want big dark cloud hanging head hurt hate life right now wish just fall asleep stay dream

"Hi everyone. My name is Charlie and I have suffered from occasional bouts of depression for a while. Something that has recently taken my interest is the inferiority complex and how this affected my perceptions of things. I first got onto the idea through a page called Depression Hurts at a Hypnosis site 121 hypnosis (its worth plugging as I have found it useful). It took a while to admit to myself that I was afraid of not belonging, being criticized, sarcastic remarks at work etc and it stems back to horrid teachers and kids at school. This has been a turning point for me though - working through the false learnings and memories, so I thought I'd share it in case it resonates with anyone else. I've since recognized symptoms of inferiority in others (and they vary widely from conceited arrogance to total withdrawal), and it's been really great.",1,hi everyone charlie suffered occasional bout depression while recently taken inferiority complex affected perception thing got idea page called depression hurt hypnosis site hypnosis it worth plugging useful took admit afraid not belonging criticized sarcastic remark work stem horrid teacher kid school turning point working false learning memory thought share case resonates else recognized symptom inferiority and vary widely conceited arrogance total withdrawal really great

"I don't feel well. Hey, I'm a highschool freshman and this has been the lowest I've ever been from the past three years of feeling like I should be gone. Buckle up your seatbelts because this'll probably be pretty long.  Since the beginning of this year, I've been wanting to die; I feel so lonely and as if nobody actually cares about me.  So, there's my primary friendship group; the people I hang out with the most. All of my (2) ""genuine"" female friends pretty much don't give two shits about me because I tend to act really clingy to them and other people because I've been friends with them since first grade and don't want to lose them. One of my female friends is kinda popular and she barely talks to me, and I just feel like I'm undeserving of her time or something; she's also kinda claimed my other female friend, so I don't get as much time to hang out with them as I used to. My guy friends are also a bit popular and they also happen to be dating my two female friends lol. They do make me feel happy talking to them, and I do hang out with them a lot, but sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be hanging out with them all that much because then I'm ""stealing"" them from my friends. I also get pretty bummed not being in a relationship when my other friends are, and I do feel like I'm not needed amongst any of my friends. (Basically, I just feel like the rebound when one of my friends aren't there).  Can we actually talk about one of my female friends a bit more, actually? We'll call her M and my other female friend B. We met M last year and we invited her to hang out with us during our lunches. M was going through a tough time and we helped her out all the time and it was great making a new really close friend. She was really fun to talk to, but I don't know...sometimes she says some shit to me that makes me kinda bummed. I remember telling her how I felt kinda depressed once, and she said something along the lines of ""Stop asking for attention and actually do something"". Another time, I was hanging out with B's boyfriend, but the next day, M was mad at me and told me I shouldn't take him from B (which I do get and feel bad for, but B is totally cool with it and understands how me and her boyfriend hang out :p) Recently, (I don't remember what initiated the conversation really) M and I were talking (which rarely happens anymore), and she was talking about how she feels like she doesn't have anyone that actually cares for her, when she has so many people that clearly do care about her and love her. Then she proceeds to tell me to actually go and make friends again. I hate being petty and talking about other people, but I just don't feel comfortable being very close to her anymore and I'm not sure she's interested in talking to me either.   So then that leaves like two male friends, and again because they're in relationships with B and M, I'm trying to pace myself with hanging out with them so one of them don't get upset. It's also pretty hard to make friends in a school where most people are white and really attractive, or already have their place. I'm a non-attractive Asian female that tends to make weird jokes and seem really masculine with the way that I mainly put forward, and I just don't fit in anywhere. I have a lot of anxiety of what people think of me, so then I sometimes struggle with talking to people. I wouldn't say people dislike me at all, it's just that nobody would hang out with me outside of school and it's hard to find people that are willing to spend time with me.  There's also the problem with others' expectations of me;; Almost all my life, I've been deemed ""smart"", which has caused so much pressure and anxiety throughout the years. My parents really want me to do well in school, and peers think I'm so great at everything. I *thought* it would go away after elementary school, but even here, people consider me being so ""smart"" and able to do anything. With currently a ~95 average in my classes, it's extremely difficult to maintain that and I feel like if I do any worse, someone is going to get mad at me. People expect me and think I'm so good, but really I'm just average at literally everything I do.  I also have no idea what I want to do with my life. I'm not very good at anything, and I have so many interests, it's hard to pin down something that I *should* do with my time. Nothing really interests me enough to do it for like 25~40 years of my life, and the things I would be interested in have literally no way of making a living off of or is something totally unachievable. I feel like I can't make any difference to anyone in the world, and I'll die not making an impression on anyone or having anyone really care about me in the end.  I've been hurting myself since about third grade, mostly from scratching myself with my nails until it leaves a mark for a few days and hitting myself on the back of the head. It's extremely satisfying and I feel like it's a good thing to punish myself for being such a waste. So that's pretty much the gist of it, I guess? Mostly just problems with self worth and having others view me a certain way. There is some other stuff, but nothing that I can really think of at the top of my head. These past 3 months have been excruciating, and I haven't gone a day without thinking I should just end it all and give up. I want to be happy, but that just seems so far away and I don't know if me living benefits anyone. Admittedly, I don't want to die, but I *do* at the same time? I feel like I have no place in the world and I can't talk to anyone about how I'm feeling because none of them are actually willing to hear what I have to say, so now I'm just dumping my feelings on Reddit. I'm tired of living and feeling like shit. I don't remember the last time I genuinely felt happy to be alive. I want someone I'm close to tell me that they love me and care about me and say I'm not a useless piece of garbage and that what I say isn't meaningless or invalid. I don't want to feel alone. I don't ask to feel alone. I feel alone because I am alone, and I feel like I can't tell anyone this because I don't want them to walk out of my life.  I'm sorry if this seemed really petty and like I'm just bitching about some shitty first world problems, because I know I am. :/ I just feel kinda down right now and I haven't been able to tell someone how I actually feel in months.

"First of all, a happy Christmas to one and all. My situation is that I have had moderate depression on and off since 18 years old, and 2 years ago aged 33 I had it so bad I had to be off work for 3 months. Then I tried the SSRI Escitalopram and it worked perfectly and I went back to work. I came off it a year ago and then 4 months ago I suffered a relapse and had to go back on it, and now I am OK (except when it came back for 3 days after a booze bender). My psychiatrist is saying I should take them indefinitely. As I have no side effects I am happy with this, but I am concerned about some reports saying that they start to work less well after some years. Is this right. And if so wouldn't it be better to ration them so I only take them after I relapse? So they keep on working for longer, if not the rest of my life. Is there anyone on the boards here who has been taking antidepressants for many years who has found they have become less effective and now regrets having taken them for that reason. And now suffers depression that now cannot be treated by medication? Yes I've heard that you can switch to others, but surely the same type of reasoning applies? The psychiatrist said that I had endogenous depression with a reactive cause, and that she didn't think that counseling would help. Does this make sense? A former work colleague of mine recently said that the antidepressants had made me start acting ""weird"". Well apart from posting on an internet forum I don't think I've done anything weird, and other friends agree with me. But other friends all think that it is not good for you to keep taking these ""happy pills"" for a long term, that antidepressants are a short term fix only. But what do they know. You can't really tell if others have depression from the outside.

It turns out he was serious... i guess they have a ""no refund, no return"" policy (which makes sense), so he had to take it out of the box and put batteries in it and make sure it worked AND IT DIDN'T!!!  So i had to go get another one!!!  It was very awkward, but the guy was really cool about it.    Other than that, i guess i have no news. Ta ta.

"Hi, sorry if this turns into a lengthy post, but I could do with some advice, and I think this is probably the best place to ask. Firstly, I should point out, I am a 19 year male. My problem is that I am concerned by the physical effects the depression is having on me. I have probably been suffering from depression for several years, but I only sought medical help last November after I had a breakdown. The doctor has prescribed me with Fluoxetine, and I am taking 40mg per day. I originally started off on 20mg per day, but after I told the doctor what I will tell you now, about 2 months ago, he ""upgraded"" my status to severe depression, hence the increase in dosage. I can appreciate that my mindset is slightly biased towards feeling negative, and expecting the worst, but nevertheless I can't help but feel my symptoms might be the result of an even more serious problem. The medication has helped my mind (even though I still have plenty of lows, they aren't always as severe as they were 6 months ago), yet my physical health is deteriorating to the point where that's the main factor preventing me from accomplishing day to day tasks. My symptoms are as follows (and they may be generalized, I'll admit): Constant fatigue, even after plenty of rest; constant aching throughout the body; generally feeling very weak, lacking energy and strength, e.g. carrying shopping home can leave my arms in agony; loss of coordination, I have become very clumsy, always knocking glasses over, or dropping things for no reason; occasional loss of balance, usually when getting up, or starting to walk from a stand still; joints are feeling slightly stiff, they still move, but I can feel more resistance than normal and they get very tired very quick if was to use them, or even just hold my arms straight out in front of me; and for me, the worst symptom is an almost constant tremor in both hands and arms, which sometimes spreads throughout the body. If I attempt slow, fine movements with my hands, the tremor becomes very clear and results in jerky movements. Also, I like to exercise, yet after all exercises, even low intensity ones, the trembling seems to intensify. I doubt it is anxiety, as I still shake when I am calm, relaxed and immobile. I know I can't expect I diagnosis, but I would appreciate it if anyone can tell me if the severity of the physical effects I am experiencing, is quite common, even when the mental state is much more relaxed and beginning to recover? Thanks for any help",1,hi sorry turn lengthy post advice think probably best place ask firstly point out year male problem concerned physical effect depression having me probably suffering depression year sought medical help november breakdown doctor prescribed fluoxetine taking mg day originally started mg day told doctor tell now month ago upgraded status severe depression increase dosage appreciate mindset slightly biased feeling negative expecting worst help feel symptom result problem medication helped mind even plenty low not severe month ago physical health deteriorating point main factor preventing accomplishing day day task symptom follows and generalized admit constant fatigue plenty rest constant aching body generally feeling weak lacking energy strength eg carrying shopping home leave arm agony loss coordination clumsy knocking glass over dropping thing reason occasional loss balance usually getting up starting walk stand still joint feeling slightly stiff move feel resistance normal tired quick use them just hold arm straight me me worst symptom constant tremor hand arm spread body attempt slow fine movement hand tremor clear result jerky movement also like exercise exercise low intensity one trembling intensify doubt anxiety shake calm relaxed immobile know expect diagnosis appreciate tell severity physical effect experiencing quite common mental state relaxed beginning recover thanks help

Why does he always convince himself that I’m mad and refuse to understand that I’m not even when I try to explain it?  How can I handle situations like this?

"I was first officially diagnosed as depressed when I was twelve, and had been depressed for two or three years before that, following the death of my younger sister. It took six years before I found an effective medication. During the time I was depressed, I was completely antisocial, had no friends, and was completely oblivious to the outside world. Now I'm eighteen, and I feel like I've missed a decade of social development. I have no friends, and no idea how to make any. It's all well and good to say just be friendly, but I don't know what that means! I can't make small talk, because I have no understanding of fashion, boys, make up, any of the things girls my age are meant to talk about, if that is what they're meant to talk about. Most of the things I know about other people my age I get from books and television, and I have no idea how accurate they are.  Please, I really need help. I've just started attending a 'normal' school (as opposed to a hospital school) for the first time since 8th grade, and I'd like to have friends, I just don't know how to go about it.

"I am overwhelmed by guilt over my boyfriend's sexual assault of my once-best friend. My boyfriend of 2 years and I both suffer from mental health issues and trauma. I found out somewhat recently that months ago, when my then-best friend was sleeping over we were both asleep in the bed and he touched her sexually. Apparently he was stoned and thought he might start a threesome (it was casually mentioned as a possibility earlier).  I know what he did was horrible. It makes me sick to my stomach to think that I was there and couldn't help. It makes me throw up and stay up at night knowing that I stayed with him. On the other hand, he himself is absolutely sick with guilt. He's been having non-stop anxiety attacks, crying spells, and moments of catatonia and he can't stop saying how horrible it was that he did that and how he wants to be a good person. I believe he is genuine and my first reaction is to make sure he gets treatment so nothing close to that ever happens again. He checked himself into a psychiatric ward last night.  I'm also so overwhelmed by guilt by how selfish my internal response has been. He has cheated on me before multiple times, and I can't help but ruminate on how if I were prettier this wouldn't have happened and how it effects me. One recent (smaller) time just happened and I've had to take care of his emotions while being angry about this main terrible incident and that one. Furthermore, I'm selfishly worried about how badly this is affecting me. One of the few (maybe only?) things going right in my life is school and this is affecting me so negatively in my inability to concentrate or motivate myself. I'm also upset by how critical others have been of me in this even though they are at least partially justified. He posted his story to Reddit and got mostly cautious support. I posted mine and got a lot of messages calling me a pervert, an enabler, a shitposter, and a terrible person. He told his parents and one of the things they said was ""all three of you made mistakes"". Unrelated, but last night he posted a photo of us in the ER and a girl who hates me replied ""ew you're back with her? Nonono what are you doing."" I have no idea what I've done to make everyone in my life hate me this much.

"Long text, I just want an audience. Why haven’t I killed myself yet?  It’s not the title, but a question that lingers on the back of my head every second. It’s a common trend that people live for other people but what do you do when you have no one to live for? I never had anyone to live for. It’s not a huge problem really, its another lingering question or jealousy I have whenever I meet a person. Every single one of them have someone who cares for them, even a stranger would care for them. It makes me feel jealous that no one would care for me or even bother to be nice to me unless I open my mouth and say I have cancer or they knew about any of my situation. People don’t care, they pity me. They realize, then, that I’m a hopeless situation and they can’t help me at all because they really can’t. No one can. Therapies don’t help. My therapist knows all of my situations are out of my control and he wants me to move forward with my life. It’s not really a bad idea, it’s the smart thing to do especially being someone in my situation. I just don’t know why I can’t. Every single being on the planet wants me to graduate already but my body doesn’t agree with me. It’s always either I’m too sad/ stressed/ depressed/ ashamed/ anxious/ lazy to go to school. Nothing helps. Not even the 30mg of Lexapro helps. My school counsellor is doing the nice “I get it, I understand” approach with me and it makes me feel better but it really does make me feel guilty.  I just don’t understand why are people act so shitty with me? Is it my face? Is it because no one cares and all I have is literally myself? Is it because I’m dying soon? What is it really? I just want to fucking die but I cant just let myself slash my throat or swallow a lot of pills because I’m a coward. I want the easy way out. Why isn’t cancer an instant death? Why aren’t suicide booths similar to futurama a thing?   I give up. I just want to die.   P.S. Fuck people who say they’re afraid of rejection because hunty what world do u fucking live in that not one single person has said no to you?    P.P.S. Fuck you E, I’m sorry I disappointed you that I didn’t die yet even my diagnosis’ average life span is 6 months. Don’t worry, it’s coming. And I surely fucking hope karma is real. It’s fucking people like you who deserve such things and what do you fucking get? A nice family, a handsome face, people who likes to be around you. You’re one of the people who deserve my revenge and yet I’m being like a pussy who is letting a fake thing called “karma” take care of everything. In this fucking lifetime, not a single one got any karma. (or maybe my parents did by god giving me cancer but idk they just labelled me as a liability and now has dropped me like a hot potato so that’s really more on me than on them)   PLEAAAAAAAAAAAASE I just want to die.

" Ah, what a tangled web we weave.  To say im involved in some sort of bizarre love triangle would be overdoing it.  But, in a sense, maybe thats what it is.  In order to sort this out, I should start from the beginning.  I was working in a rehab for brain injured adults when I met her.  She was a petite spunky girl recently arrived in the area from california.  Some how or another, she showed interest in me and begain inviting me places outside of work.  I didn't really care, I was a student supporting myself and dealing with roomate problems, housing problems, getting to class on time, getting to work on time...the whole in and out of survival.  But, while im not all that great at subtle hints, she was aggressive enough for me to pick up on the fact that she liked me.  And so, after a long night of drinking and a bit of passing out and *unkowningly* spooning her, our relationship began.  It was cool, did all the great things you during a new relationship: trips to the beach, visiting the family, staying up late talking, holding hands, doggie style sex...(heh).  At some point, irresponsible as we were there was an abortion.  I dont want to go into here how bad that affected me; for her, I can only imagine it was much worse experience; but, it was her request and I supported it.  I do know having to walk through a thong of anti-abortion assholes didnt make it easy at all.  Not to mention I wanted to choke the living hell out of a few of em.  Time passed and the relationship seemed good.  Then, one day, she told me she was moving back to california and wanted me to come after I graduated in a semester.  I wasnt too sure about this; but, I agreed.  She left.  Afterwards, I continued to go to school and doubt settled in.  Perhaps I should break up with her?  Next installment....I move to california, relationship ends, we become friends...and then the web grows more complicated....

"Psychiatrist of 6 years terminated me as a patient and is refusing refills of Lamictal because I went to outpatient rehab? I have been going to the same psychiatrist for 6 years.  I have been on a high dose of Lamictal for 6 years to treat bipolar disorder.  I have gone to regular appointments and have had consistent refills.  I had a period of intense depression in which I went on a one month drinking binge and went to a hospital where I was given Ativan to deal with the withdrawal.

"No lodging for the sad Being depressed sucks. That's easy to grasp. Most people who aren't clinically depressed understand this. What they don't understand is that being depressed and honestly trying to get better is extremely difficult, and our ruggedly individualistic society doesn't give a single fuck about you. You need help? Fuck you.  Your wealth isn't just something you have, it's seen as a reflection of your worth as a person. Poor? Sad? Find it difficult to wake up? Find it difficult to complete things? Do you procrastinate because of underlying psychological issues? Fuck you, you're just lazy.  The clear message capitalism sends me is that if I can't work, or I can't work enough, or I can't work doing a ""high value job"", or if I need help to get better so that I can do those ""high value jobs"", I probably ought to just go die, because I'm clearly worth nothing.",1,lodging sad depressed suck easy grasp people not clinically depressed understand this not understand depressed honestly trying better extremely difficult ruggedly individualistic society doe not single fuck you need help fuck you wealth not just have seen reflection worth person poor sad difficult wake up difficult complete thing procrastinate underlying psychological issue fuck you just lazy clear message capitalism sends work work enough work doing high value job need help better high value job probably ought just die clearly worth nothing

"Should I attempt to repair our friendship one last time? So a few months ago a close friend and I had a sort of fight because I made a shitty passive aggressive comment.  I apologised shortly afterwards and felt terrible about it, even apologised more a day later.  Anyhow they said they needed some space, we happened to work together and sit right next to each other. So I left them be for awhile, they basically refused to even look or speak to me. After a month or so this started to take its toll on me, emotionally and mentally I wasn't equipped to deal with it.   So eventually after 66 days of this, something I could not get away from I snapped and out of desperation as I was losing my mind I told I'm walking away as without communication the friendship is doomed.  So that's where it ended, they then carried on ignoring me for the rest of our time at work, they eventually left to go to a new place. Even at the farewell I was ignored till the last 10 minutes then got some communication.  After that a couple weeks later on my birthday they randomly wished me a happy birthday on a work group. Completely unexpected, sadly this confused the shit out of me and I drunkenly sent some message about being tired of all the hurt. Then I was blocked. I have since not contacted them in any way for over a month.

"relationship with sister falling apart, different memories, need advice Hi,  In a nutshell - my sister (both about 30years old) has been accusing me of saying various horrible/bad things, often saying I said it seconds ago, sometimes hours ago and getting angry with me.  I don't think I've been saying these things.  It's really wearing me down, either I am being horrible and forgetting, or she is (perhaps unknowingly) making it up.

"Advice on where to post for advice on taking antidepressants. Hi, UK based poster - I've recently taken my Doctors advice and got a prescription for antidepressants. I've been in-and-out of various states of mild to severe depression throughout my teens &amp; twenties, but I've always figured this is just something everyone has to deal with at some stage or another, so I've never sought help even when falling off a proverbial cliff edge. After much deliberation, someone I care deeply about got me to try counselling, but I find that I'm really not getting much out of it right now, as I don't have the will to try, and my focus is all over the place (I'm being tested for ADHD too, but I'm still awaiting the results). My Doctor suggested trying a combination of antidepressants and CBT (the latter of which I am currently attempting to source a support group for), however I have an underlying phobia of long-term medication after seeing several people close to me, use it as a crutch and just become something wholly unfamiliar to me as a result. I've been prescribed Citalopram (Celexa for those stateside) but like I said - I have deep-seated reservations about taking them and before I tried, I wanted to see if there was anywhere/anyone I could talk to about their experiences on the drug and any perhaps any suggestions they could offer about managing short-term (6-9 months) antidepressant medication? I've looked at the sub-reddit rules for this group and I'm not sure if this crosses rule 3; if so, can someone help me find the right place to ask my question(s)?",1,advice post advice taking antidepressant hi uk based poster recently taken doctor advice got prescription antidepressant inandout various state mild severe depression teen amp twenty figured just deal stage another sought help falling proverbial cliff edge deliberation care deeply got try counselling really not getting right now not try focus place i tested adhd too awaiting result doctor suggested trying combination antidepressant cbt the currently attempting source support group for underlying phobia longterm medication seeing people close me use crutch just wholly unfamiliar result prescribed citalopram celexa stateside like said deepseated reservation taking tried wanted anywhereanyone talk experience drug suggestion offer managing shortterm month antidepressant medication looked subreddit rule group not sure cross rule so help right place ask question

"I have been in two accidents one in October (went to take pictures of my sister in the parade, she was nominated for homecoming queen), and one in February. The first accident really messed not only my mind, but my body up. Now I am 23, and have severe back, shoulder, and knee pain that I have been treated for, and other pain that I just refuse to go to the doctor for (all from the first accident). I have done the specialist thing, and physical therapy. Nothing has made me feel better other than temporarily (if all I do physically is nothing). I can't work, clean, or do anything I enjoy without it making the pain worse. I am at my witsi end. I am in the deepest hole I have ever been in.

" I am a French born Hong-Kong guy. I have always wondered what my life could have been if I was not born here but there.   I have always wondered what would my life be if I grew up with people of ""my kind"", if people stopped asking about my origins and more about me.  I have just started a new job after a year where I have been mostly doing nothing but having fun, meeting people and having a heartache. Heartache ? Yes, I kind of left my heart in Hong-Kong the last time I went there in December 2003. I stayed there for a month and a half and found out I really enjoy the life there.   Really I do, even if it is harder to leave in Hong Kong than in Lyon (France). Even if work is tougher, even if I would spend more time commuting, even if I would have less money.  I think like I belong there, I don't read nor write Chinese but I speak Cantonese. I kind of feel alive there.  Is it because each time I have been there was on vacation ? Maybe. Now I want to try the real life there.  I have to stop hesitating.   Last time I was there, I attended a wedding. This time, I will also attend a wedding of very close relatives.  I often listen to a radio show from RTHK 2, Mak sir is on the mic and always says : Never give up ! From his point of view, anyone can start over from nothing any time in his life. I agree with him.  With everything I like about HK, why do I hesitate so much ? Am I affraid to leave my family ? Maybe. Am I affraid to fail my endeavour ? Maybe. Do I have th guts to do it ? Yes. Do I have money to do it ? Not quite.  I have to make up my mind in the next couple of months.

"Drifting away from my best friend My best friend and I have known each other for well over a decade, and have gone to the same schools and last year when she went away.   We text everyday and see each other regularly but recently I’ve been feeling so disjointed from her.  We’re really close and I’ve told her things I’ve never told anyone.   She just got into her first serious relationship, had sex for the first time, got drunk for the first time and also had her first pregnancy scare (i was with her when she took the test).  We’re 17 by the way.  However, whenever we talk it’s always about her life, and her boyfriend. She built up so much courage to dump him only to get back with him the next week. They’ve known each other for only a month and he said i love you within a week of them dating. He’s emotionally manipulative and so immature but she insists that she only tells me the bad things about him not the good things.   I want to support her but she makes it so hard. She never asks about my life anymore. I’m going through a really tough time yet it’s never come up. All we talk about is her and her relationship. I know it’s a big part of her life but it feels like my life is just irrelevant to her.  I’ve never drank alcohol or had sex or even been in a relationship so it feels like we’re just drifting apart. I don’t relate to her anymore.   Obviously I love her loads but it feels like this friendship is one sided and purely based on her.

"the beautiful things in life Light streaming through the leaves of a tree. The night sky, thousands of pinpricks in black velvet. Someone so beautiful they make you catch your breath when you look at them. Those songs that make the hairs stand on your arms. The only thing that keeps me alive is the beauty in the world. It makes time slow down just for a little, and stops the incessant flow of (mostly negative) thoughts. There's so much beauty left to see. It can be as amazing as the the clear blue waters surrounding a tropical island. It could be as mundane as a flock of birds flying in harmony over your roof. Sure, there are a lot of really shitty things that we go through, but there are those breathtaking moments you have yet to experience. Those moments where you think ""damn, it really is nice to be alive.""",1,beautiful thing life light streaming leaf tree night sky thousand pinprick black velvet beautiful make catch breath look them song make hair stand arm thing keep alive beauty world make time slow just little stop incessant flow mostly negative thought beauty left see amazing clear blue water surrounding tropical island mundane flock bird flying harmony roof sure lot really shitty thing through breathtaking moment experience moment think damn really nice alive
"My formative years were spent in small towns. Until the third grade, I lived in Indiana. From the third grade through my junior year in high school, I lived in a small lakeside community in southwestern Michigan. You could walk or ride your bike to anywhere - down to the lake, out on country roads, wherever. My father was a Lutheran school teacher, principal and church organist. From time to time, he would take a ""call"" to serve in another Lutheran school in a different town. In the summer of 1968, right after my junior year in high school, he decided to take a call to a school in the north side of the city of St. Louis. It was quite a culture shock for a sheltered young woman who had only lived in small, insular towns all her life, to move to a city the size of St. Louis. Quite honestly, when we arrived here I absolutely hated it. I felt as if I'd been thrown to the dark side of the moon. I had to start my senior year in a new high school in a completely foreign environment. Everyone else already had their group or circle of friends going back at least three years. Now you had to have a lot more guts and fortitude and self-esteem than I had at the time to break into already established groups and make new friends. This was the year that would set the stage for the first major depressive episode in my life. This was the year of my first therapist, the first of many to come. The start of a lifetime of self-discovery.",1,formative year spent small town grade lived indiana grade junior year high school lived small lakeside community southwestern michigan walk ride bike lake country road wherever father lutheran school teacher principal church organist time time call serve lutheran school different town summer right junior year high school decided school north city st louis quite culture shock sheltered young woman lived small insular town life city size st louis quite honestly arrived absolutely hated it felt thrown dark moon start senior year new high school completely foreign environment group circle friend going year lot gut fortitude selfesteem time break established group make new friend year set stage major depressive episode life year therapist come start lifetime selfdiscovery
"How to get over my ex best friend Ok so all throughout high school (I graduated high school 4 years ago) I had a best friend. We were sisters literally thought we would be friends forever. We graduated I got into my first relationship and we drifted apart and she never really let me know how she felt. She told me one day she wishes I would stop talking about him so much and that kind of was like ok cool that kind of sucks but not a big deal. Being in my first relationship that I’m currently still in it sucked not being able to talk about it because I was so excited. Anyways months passed and we got into an argument and basically we ended our friendship because she thought I was an awful friend because I was too busy for her. Fast forward a year after that we started talking again (I reached out, I always do) we started being “friends” again but it felt so awkward. Honestly though she’s the only one who was ever angry and made things not feel the same. On her 21st birthday she invited everyone to her party at her house but me and told me it was because we didn’t talk much and she didn’t want awkward vibes at her house. After that I just unfollowed her on social media and we didn’t talk at all. I messaged her over the summer congratulating her to see she was taking a trip to China and then she messaged me on my birthday. This all happened in 2017 so our friendship has been fucked up for like 2 years now. Because I deleted her number a while ago I decided to reach out and talk to her on Instagram saying happy birthday and hope she was doing well and she never replied and I know she saw it. So our friendship is dead. I’ve known it’s been dead too for like 2 years now but how do I stop being so damn hurt? I think it hurts even more because she truly doesn’t give a fuck and she was my best friend ever. I wish I could go back and do something else to fix it. Idk lately I’ve cried so much. I haven’t been able to find a good friend like her again even though she wasn’t THAT great. How can I stop obsessing over our friendship and just let it go? I constantly look at her Instagram to see how she’s doing and it just really sucks. :( ",0,ex best friend ok high school i graduated high school year ago best friend sister literally thought friend forever graduated got relationship drifted apart really let know felt told day wish stop talking kind like ok cool kind suck not big deal relationship currently sucked not able talk excited anyways month passed got argument basically ended friendship thought awful friend busy her fast forward year started talking i reached out do started friend felt awkward honestly angry thing not feel same st birthday invited party house told did not talk did not want awkward vibe house just unfollowed social medium did not talk all messaged summer congratulating taking trip china messaged birthday happened friendship fucked like year now deleted number ago decided reach talk instagram saying happy birthday hope doing replied know saw it friendship dead known dead like year stop damn hurt think hurt truly doe not fuck best friend ever wish fix it idk lately cried much not able good friend like not great stop obsessing friendship just let go constantly look instagram doing just really suck

"I had my second appointment with my naturopathic doctor today. I'm getting this feeling that she is really just a therapist for people who don't want to go to a therapist. She lets me ramble on about all sorts of things that have very little to do with my health. Like what our rules for Jeffrey and food are. Last time she gave me a series of homeopathic remedies (Undas) to support my liver. This time it was a capsule called Ichol. I'm not sure if these things do anything more than lighten my wallet, but I'm willing to try them for now. I do desperately need to lose weight and if there is any chance that these things will help, I'm willing to go for it for a while. I've been searching the net reading about Katirina and other personal tragedies that bloggers are going through and I'm sort of jealous. My life is just full of 'normal' stuff right now. My grandpa died in August and we went to his funeral but it doesn't affect my life in a large way. Just in the morally rehensible way that now I don't have to feel guilty about not going to see him. It's not that I didn't want to see him, I just never found the time and now I don't have to worry about it. At some level I'm sure that means that I'm headed to eternal damnation.

"My Story of Elder Abuse: Internet Romance Scams and the devastating consequences I'm living a nightmare watching a woman 50 years younger than my 80-year-old father coerce him into marriage, manipulate him and taking his money all in the name of ""love"". The relationship started as Ghanaian romance scam (usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/romance-scams/) and after we uncovered it was a male in Ghana pretending to be an American woman, it eventually led to a Ghanaian woman residing in Cuba, showing up at my father's doorstep and coercing him into marriage two weeks later. The story is long, complex, and out of this world so I won't go into it here. We've tried it all: FBI, USICE/immigration, State Dept., AARP, private investigators, the District Attorney, police, adult protective services, elder abuse attorney's and filing for conservatorship.   The harsh reality I'm learning is though the crime is so blatantly obvious to everyone, I'm told over and over by the authorities that individuals have the right to abuse themselves. My father is showing serious signs of dementia but his executive functioning is still intact and we cannot get him to see a neuropsychologist without a long and painful court battle.   To the outside world, he comes across as just fine, but my normally mild-mannered, extremely rational and brilliant father has had explosive and violent episodes, personality changes, impulsive behavior, and has been unduly influenced and taken advantage of over an over again. He cannot see that people are lying to him even though the lies are later revealed to him. I've had a huge reality check just how powerful civil liberties to make bad decisions are in the USA along with the financial rights that coexist in marriage, no matter how corrupt.   I'm not writing for advice since I know in my heart my father is not well and is no longer the father I know and love. What I want to know is if anyone else out there has experienced elder financial abuse in their family, and romance scams or partner abuse in particular. I want to hear your story. I am appalled that though financial elder abuse is rampant throughout the USA, and internet romance scams are only on the rise, there seems to be no major initiatives or policies to protect our vulnerable elders.

"Letter To Dad - Christian Fatherhood Author Kent Nerburn once wrote, “It is much easier to become a father than to be one.” This rings true, even for those men who really want to be a father. With enough hard work and determination we can master a career, a hobby, or a sport but it is difficult to even control anything in fatherhood, let alone master it.

"This is beyond messed up for me to think but I kind of just need to vent. I got a phone call this morning that my great uncle died last night. I cannot stand this man to begin with. He’s an addict, a liar, a thief, abuser, manipulator, convicted felon multiple times. He was attempting to run from the cops and he hit a telephone pole and he died. Im assuming he was DUI or picking up drugs. I’m not one bit surprised. In fact, I’m surprised he lived this long.   He was given every resource and opportunity in the world and he fucked every single one of them up for the past 50+ years.

"Frustrating Friend So my friend loves to catch up for coffee. Invites 10 or so of us to one session to catch up with as many of us as possible. I'm a SAHM with a nearly 3 year old and 8 weeks off giving birth to my second. I'm also dealing with my husband being in a new job so it's a new routine for our boy. It's also a 40 minute bus ride into the city each time, maybe longer sometimes coz our weather is crap most of the time (take note). My friend knows this but constantly badgers me to come for coffee whenever HE has free time. He just started a new job as of yesterday. Before this he had free time 24/7. I told him in a huge message how my circumstances make it hard to just head into the city when he asks and that I can manage it on days I have midwife appointments. He replied that he had just as much responsibilities that he had to deal with but he managed to still come into town to visit everyone.  It feels like he just ignored what I was saying and that meeting him was more important. Soooo frustrated!! What do I do? Am I a crap friend or does he need to understand where I'm coming from better?

"How do I reconcile with a failed friendship from the past Earlier this year, I met a Colombian woman in my state and failed at my attempts to date her; many of our disagreements surrounded my personal history of morbid obesity.  Although I am 5'9'' and now weight around 240 lbs, I have weighed nearly 400 lbs as a teenager and young adult.  We dined together and talked to each other for around two weeks.  Within that timeframe, I became very disaffected by her constant criticisms of other men she dated, such as her issues with their hygiene, lack of direction, etc.  After talking to her nearly everyday, she suddenly asked me ""Do you think we're dating?... I think we can only be friends.""  I immediately parted ways with her, informed her of my thoughts on her demanding and emotionally draining ways, very bluntly told her that I didn't like her, and directed her to no longer communicate with me.  After another two weeks, she texted me out of the blue and said she ""understood"" my anger, asked to reconnect saying that she though I was a ""beautiful"" person, and eventually informed me that her ""biggest concern was my weight.""  After another month, we went out (with me spending money for gas, etc.) and explored multiple regions in my state.  She kept encouraging me to lose weight and gave me a diet book.  Within the last times we spoke, she confided in me that she was an undocumented immigrant and told me - in anguished tears - about a failed marriage here in the U.S., as well as unwanted sexual encounters she faced here.   I offered my help, but she declined any of my attempts to reconcile her immigration status.  After another week, I became very depressed about not meeting specific weight targets.  I eventually broke down, said I felt ""less than human,"" and asked if we could postpone any further in-person meetings until I could lose enough weight.  Over the weekend, she ignored my texts; I drove to her home to see if she was okay and noticed her car was parked outside.  She eventually texted me, saying that I was a person with ""unfriendly attitudes"" sometimes.  Later in the day, she told me that hearing me talk of my weight was tiring.  I was so baffled I couldn't get out a response.  After that, she told me that  I am ""too sensitive,"" looked at the criticism as an insult, and then mockingly told me ""everything hurts you, everything affects you.""  I told her that ignoring me was inherently wrong and hung up.  She then gave me a long text ending that I should ""just be happy... happiness isn't just about body image.""    I need advice on how to handle situations like this.  My gut reaction was to tell her she was a ""selfish bitch"" and hang up the phone.  Looking back, that's probably what I needed to do, because that's exactly what I was thinking at the time.  Secondly, I need to really reevaluate a relationship with a therapist who told me that cutting her off the first time I did was the wrong thing to do.   I am holding a serious grudge against him, particularly as I don't trust him anymore.  In sum, I am unhappy in life - because of shit like this.  I try to be a good person and deal with human turds.  But I need to be strong enough to break out of it rather than be a victim.",0,reconcile failed friendship past earlier year met colombian woman state failed attempt date her disagreement surrounded personal history morbid obesity weight lb weighed nearly lb teenager young adult dined talked week timeframe disaffected constant criticism men dated issue hygiene lack direction etc talking nearly everyday suddenly asked do think dating think friend immediately parted way her informed thought demanding emotionally draining way bluntly told did not like her directed longer communicate me week texted blue said understood anger asked reconnect saying beautiful person eventually informed biggest concern weight month went with spending money gas etc explored multiple region state kept encouraging lose weight gave diet book time spoke confided undocumented immigrant told anguished tear failed marriage u unwanted sexual encounter faced here offered help declined attempt reconcile immigration status week depressed not meeting specific weight target eventually broke down said felt le human asked postpone inperson meeting lose weight weekend ignored text drove home okay noticed car parked outside eventually texted me saying person unfriendly attitude sometimes later day told hearing talk weight tiring baffled not response that told too sensitive looked criticism insult mockingly told everything hurt you affect you told ignoring inherently wrong hung up gave long text ending just happy happiness not just body image need advice handle situation like this gut reaction tell selfish bitch hang phone looking back probably needed do exactly thinking time secondly need really reevaluate relationship therapist told cutting time did wrong thing do holding grudge him particularly not trust anymore sum unhappy life shit like this try good person deal human turd need strong break victim

"i'm circling the drain i'm sorry if this is in the wrong place.  i feel like i'm at my limit  i'm trying to wait for health insurance to kick in from my fast food job. i hate this job. i like my co-workers, even though they think i'm weird. i'm trying so hard to get them to like me. i just want people to like me. people always said i was weird and made fun of me. i mean, thats like anyone else, i guess.   i've always hated myself. always. i'm aware its probably internalized whatever from however many years of violent bullying and social isolation, but its to a point where my gf and roomate can see. i'm trying so hard to work this job and i'm smoking so much weed to cope and i get so anxious and have to talk to all these people and i'm always doing something weird and all i want to do is play Melee because its how i decompress (i do music as well but its shit), but i've developed thoracic outlet syndrome i guess from chest breathing for years and now my scalenes are fucked and everytime i play Melee i start chest breathing and i can't do the one thing i really want to do and i know thats pathetic, i can't quit my job because we need rent, i don't want to leave because i need health insurance so i can start going to therapy and possibly start physical therapy because my posture (forward head) is fucked. i don't talk to any of my friends. for some reason once they're not physically there i can't be a good friend. i lost my original best friend that way, socially defective. all i have is my gf and puppy and roommate and i flucuate between 'splitting' on them (because i possibly have bpd) and desperately wanting to avoid having them seeing everything wrong with me, they're all i have.  i don't mean to be an attention whore  i've always been this ugly, boring fucking unwanted piece of worm shit. my dad cheated on his wife with my mom. i knew he had left when i was young but i didn't know i was a mistake until my uncle told me, in so many words, the 'truth' about my birth, and how i'm lucky to be alive, and how she prolly should've aborted me (i was a spoiled, shit kid and he was trying to get my attention. honestly this story isn't even a big deal, though i did break down retelling it once. i'm filing it under just being high at the time). i kind of ruined my mother's life. kids never liked me either. in general, people only like me when i'm in full 'social camouflage'. i'm nice, witty, assertive, all the traits of normal folk. as soon as that camo starts to thin, and i start doing all my stupid retarded fucking worthless mannerisms, or sounds, or daydreaming, or opening my mouth to talk naturally about anything i want to at all, i'm outed. i've had my entire classroom laugh at me, more than once. my own friends, even by original bets friend, would make fun of me and call me ugly. i mean, again, nothing new, but just to paint a picture of whatever i guess i'm sorry  i wish i was prettier. i'm a guy but sometimes i wish i was a girl. i don't think its gender dysphoria, i just abhor my physical appearance. i can count on the fingers of one hand how many times ive looked into any kind of reflective surface.  i come from Christianity so i guess the idea of me possibly having depression is so surreal to me. i've thought of suicide nearly every day since this year's started. some days every hour. every minute. constantly. sometimes i daydream about it. sometimes the thoughts make me sad. sometimes i'm so mad at myself i want to make the thoughts a reality, blood and all. sometimes the thoughts get so bad, so gory and so tragic. i'm sorry i guess there's something wrong with me, i feel scared because i feel like i'm being pushed over the edge and i can't do anything about it. i talk to myself, in actual back and forth convos, completely with laughing and inside jokes and even some 'us' 'we' and the like pronouns thrown in (sounds like so many other internet posts lmao). it started as a imaginary friend, and just kinda went from there as I trimmed the fat. it helped. i've been so abysmally lonely most of my life. i have a gf and puppy now. she knows i'm depressed, but i can't tell her how much. i can't tell her that i scope out the highway water bridges for places i can park. or at least walk to. i'm trying so hard. on one hand i know what killing myself would do to her. but some times it gets so dark. sometimes it gets so bad i know she'll be overjoyed to see my corpse. sometimes i think about killing myself in front of her, or my co workers. i think about dying, every day, every minute, every second. i think about dying painfully. i'm smoking all the weed i can and i try not to think about it. i just tell myself i'm venting, mentally. i've never attempted. its just ideation.

"Poor Spring. He tries so hard but sometimes things don't work despite best laid plans. His ex wife is doing 'something' almost every weekend in August and September. So his plan to take me away have dissolved. Thing is... I kind of think it's a tad bit of not wanting to see him happy. Ex's are so hard to deal with. Look at me and Cretin. He still continues to make our lives a misery on every given occasion. Wait until he finds out I have a boyfriend. It'll be 50 questions as to who he is, his family heritage and down to whether we have depraved sexual practices in front of the girls. I also really detest his girlfriend... Mainly because of the times she's upset the kids. It's not the kids fault. I feel like Small Spring is caught in the middle a little bit and won't have him made to feel bad in any way. So we aren't going away in the way we'd planned.... We're trying to snatch a night in July maybe? We'll see, no pressure. It's meant to be fun not a trial. There's always the turkey and tinsel fun weekends at Christmas. I can wear tinsel in strategic places and feel MUCH more relaxed ;) I feel good tonight.

" I'm bored but strangly happy today. I did nothing today (except workout) and it was awesome. My color is Copper and I taste like honey. I like that; better than tasting like copper. Honey is sweet, so I think it fits me well; however it is also sticky and annoying. I shall ignore those attributes of the honeyness. But honey is pretty...and well, we've been over that before. And if you don't know what pretty is, pretty = hot. I know, I know; it's all very confusing. Just know that when a girl calls you pretty, its not that bad of a thing (Most of the time). My alarm clock just went off...how odd.  Julia called again, dont really want to talk to her. She and Crystal came out on Friday after the Fair fiasco. I went to Tiffany to escape them. I prolly would have had a VERY VERY good time, but I don't want to have the pressure of that looming over my head, should I decide to never speak to them again. Sure, Im not going to turn it down if its  right there , but with both of them here it would have been weird. Don't ask why, it just would have. Tiff says Im turning into a man slut. I disagree.

"Women ignore me, even here, they think I'm unworthy or too ugly to be helped. I even have the stats to prove it. Why am I so undeserving of love? I made a post yesterday today asking for help as to why I'm undatable and why no women wants to go out with me. I got 450+ views and only 6 comments, only 1 of which was from a woman. Everyone else was a male who either tried to give some advice or made fun of me. Here's proof: https://imgur.com/a/TRWg3  So if 250 women viewed my profile, only one person tried to say something. Everyone else ignored me. 1/250. 249/250 women think I'm ugly or not worthy of a relationship. Think about that. That's how unwanted I am. What if every 3 minutes, someone told you ""you're ugly, no one wants you, no one cares for you, and you will die forever alone""? That's the life I might as well live in. Let's not also forget the people that made fun of me too. I mean, what do you want me to do to get your replies, ladies? Do you want me to give you gold? Will that incentivize you to reply?  The sidebar says ""A supportive space for anyone struggling with depression."" and yet people make fun of me, don't want to help, and call me ugly. I guess I'm that hopeless.

"Dear reddit, i need your help I've never had a good relationship with my family. I am 15/m and always seen by everyone as overly sensitive and feminine. Kinda makes my life harder.

I end up freaking out on the inside and my parents just tell me that this is the best part if my life and u should enjoy it. Hesri g that makes me want to kill myself more than the usual amount because I know what torture it is to be alive and if this is the best it gets what is the point. It's currently 12:32 and I'm in the basement after my brother kicked me out of my own bed. I got about 5 mins of sleep before this happened and the part that really pisses me off about it is the fact that I'm an insomniac. It's a miracle I get anything and he just wakes me up. My brother is 10. When he was 8 and 9 he would have tried to drown me multiple times and stab me once. When my diagnosis came around he's been doing everything he can to.push me towards suicide. I go to tell my friends about things that have been said to me and things that I'm feeling and their response is always dude u have a gf don't be depressed or just what the fuck is wrong with u.

"I think I may have been on this forum (it looked different) back in 2002 when I had a major bout with depression and anxiety due to some serious financial worries. I've always been prone to this I guess, but I'm starting to figure out that it's big, nasty life-changes that trigger it. Well, here I go again. This time it's relationship-related. My wife and I are on brink of divorce. I found out almost a year ago that she has been emotionally involved with another man, and was no longer ""in-love"" with me. We somehow muddled through the next several months, even though I found out it was still going on, we kept ""trying"" anyway, and things were still tolerable and ok, I guess. (We still shared same bed, got affectionate, cuddled and even made love). About 3 weeks ago, I discovered that it still had not ended, and they were actually conspiring on getting together in March. Well, all hell broke loose and things got worse than ever. I'm now in a separate room, sleeping on a single bed, and I'm miserable. I resumed Wellbutrin when this all started last spring (I took Wellbutrin for about 9 months when I had my episode in 2002), and have been taking it since. But since this really bad turn of events, I knew I couldn't take it, and to be honest, even before I discovered again, my therapist told me that I need to revisit my doctor and prescriptions because I've got some serious anxiety issues. So now I just started Zoloft (25mg/day) in addition to the Wellbutrin. I don't know how things are going to turn out. I'm in ""limbo"" while I give her ""time and space to figure things out."" The Zoloft I think started to kick in today, but not in a good way. I'm actually feeling MORE depressed when I came in this morning...I almost broke down crying in front of my computer -argh! My mood swings are horrible. All I can think about is going home and crawling into my bed and taking an Ambien, even though I hate that bed and want to be in the big bed with my wife. I almost wish at times that she would just say, ""That's it, we're done"", so I can know what is going on and just move on with my life. I may end up single and lonely anyway, but at least I'll have the opportunity to look for someone else. Right now I feel like a prisoner, being starved of basic human needs, like hugs, touches, affection.

"I think I ruined another friendship TL;DR: Made a wonderful friend, had a depressive episode, and ruined the friendship by trying to force my problems on her. Just like I've done a million time before.  I've had depression my whole life and I've always gone through episodes. Sometimes they're mild, and I'm just generally down for a few days, sometimes they debilitating and I can barely get out of bed for weeks. I've also never had a lot of friends. I don't have casual relationships. I either don't really think of you a friend, or I love you with every part of my heart. There's no middle ground.  I've been building a friendship with a great girl from work (call her Amy) for a few months. It doesn't seem like anything romantic is gonna come from it, but it was nice to have a friend I could do stuff with. We went hiking, rock climbing, we even went on a scuba trip to the Caribbean together. I'd opened up to her about my depression and she seemed really understanding. She actually seemed to appreciate how open and communicative I was about it.  The day before the Super Bowl, I felt an episode coming on. It wasn't severe, but it made me fragile. I'm a big Patriots fan, so when the Pats lost, it set me up for a bad episode. If I'd just been sad about the Patriots Monday and let myself heal like I usually do when my teams lose, everything would have been fine, but instead I started to blow my friendship.  I texted Amy Tuesday that I was feeling down and I'd like to see her. I made a big deal about how I wasn't crying about the Pats, but I was having an episode. It seemed important to me to point that out for some reason. She said someone was visiting from our India office and had a ton of work for her, but she would try to come over after. She worked until 930 that night and never made it.  Wednesday I left work at 10am because I was too down to stay. I was texting her the same stuff throughout the day, how I was sad and I wanted to see her. She worked until 930 again and didn't come, but this time she had never promised to. I texted her this big apology about how I've been a shitty friend and I'm sorry for forcing my problems on her. At work Thursday she told me to stop apologizing for everything. I told her I would try to stop.  Friday just felt different. She was less talkative with me than usual. She brought me cookies she made, and I thought that might be a sign that things were getting better, but after work I asked her if she had plans that weekend, and her answer was simply ""yes"". I said have fun and left. Normally she would have at least told me she a general idea of what she was doing.  I talked to my roommate/best friend (Samantha) about it Friday night. We agreed I needed to just leave Amy alone for the weekend, so I texted her and said if she found any free time I'd love to see her and then I didn't contact her again until yesterday at work.  Yesterday some things happened that really made me feel like things were ending. First, we had talked about planning a trip President's day weekend, but she had a surgery and she didn't want to plan anything until it was done (that's a whole other thing that's bothering me). When I asked her yesterday, she said she thought President's day was in March and she promised to see her brother this weekend, so ""we'll see"". She also told me she likes working late and going to the gym at like 930. Apparently she's been working 12 hour days for the past week. The gym part hurt because one of my favorite things to do with her was work out, and now I've lost my gym buddy.  I've had a lot of friendships go this way in the past. Speaking a little immodestly here, but when I'm not depressed, I'm funny, energetic, and interesting, and generally a fun person to be around. I've had lots of people enter my life, meet that me, like him, then after a few months meet the depressed side of me and just nope the fuck out.   Amy first met the depressed me a few months ago and she didn't run away. I thought she could be a big part of my support network moving forward. But I'm worried that I just tried to put too much on her. Like I've done a million times before.  The worst part is she sits right next to me at work. She's leaving next month to hike the Appalachian Trail, but until then, if I really did blow this, then I have to sit next to her every day for a month. I don't know if I can handle that.  Anyway, thanks for listening to me whine about my problems.",1,think ruined friendship tlr wonderful friend depressive episode ruined friendship trying force problem her just like million time before depression life gone episode mild just generally day debilitating barely bed week lot friend not casual relationship not really think friend love heart middle ground building friendship great girl work call amy month doe not like romantic gonna come it nice friend stuff with went hiking rock climbing went scuba trip caribbean together opened depression really understanding actually appreciate open communicative it day super bowl felt episode coming on not severe fragile big patriot fan pat lost set bad episode just sad patriot monday let heal like usually team lose fine instead started blow friendship texted amy tuesday feeling like her big deal not cry pat having episode important point reason said visiting india office ton work her try come after worked night it wednesday left work am stay texting stuff day sad wanted her worked did not come time promised to texted big apology shitty friend sorry forcing problem her work thursday told stop apologizing everything told try stop friday just felt different talkative usual brought cooky made thought sign thing getting better work asked plan weekend answer simply yes said fun left normally told general idea doing talked roommatebest friend samantha friday night agreed needed just leave amy weekend texted said free time love did not contact yesterday work yesterday thing happened really feel like thing ending first talked planning trip president day weekend surgery did not want plan that thing bothering me asked yesterday said thought president day march promised brother weekend we see told like working late going gym like apparently working hour day past week gym hurt favorite thing work out lost gym buddy lot friendship way past speaking little immodestly here not depressed funny energetic interesting generally fun person around lot people enter life meet me like him month meet depressed just nope fuck out amy met depressed month ago did not run away thought big support network moving forward worried just tried her like million time before worst sits right work leaving month hike appalachian trail then really did blow this sit day month not know handle that anyway thanks listening whine problem
"Anyone ever look back at their younger years and wonder how they used to be such a joyful person? I saw a post on here about someone remembering a feeling of emptiness since they were five and just not knowing it was depression.  For me it's the opposite.  I was always a super joyful kid, and maybe a little too hyper.  (I was that annoying kid when I was 10-11).  Then around seventh grade I started to withdrawal from the world slightly, and just talked a little less than average.  This seemed all fine at the time, it made me a more likable person.  But I think that was the beginning.  I finally realized my lack of a friend group because of how I acted when I was younger during third quarter that year.  It wasn't bad depression, but it only got worse from there.  My Dad turned from mean to abusive starting next year, and my mom started to be disappointed with everything I do.  My parents don't even know anything about me besides a few keywords because they haven't held a conversation with me since I was 11.  The only person who I can say genuinely cares for me is my best friend, and he doesn't even know I am depressed.  I don't see a reason why I am, so why should I explain that to someone who is much more depressed than I am?  By the time I turned 14 I can say I was depressed.  ""Functionally depressed"" I guess, using terminology from one of the top posts here.  I don't know what to do.

"I want to die [trigger warning] [Trigger Warning]     My trauma happened when i was 8, I'm now 18 and still suffer from it daily. I actually suppressed the trauma completely until I was 12, when it all came back to me; so I guess I've only really been dealing with it for 6 years now.    I have severe PTSD, severe depression, anxiety, severe panic/anxiety attacks, OCD, severe memory loss, and had an intense eating disorder for 6 years that I'm still struggling with constantly. I haven't gotten a good nights' sleep in years. I have constant PTSD nightmares, regular nightmares, and insomnia/constant fatigue and exhaustion. I also disassociate a lot and self harmed for years. Currently clean from self harm for about a year and a half. I've been admitted to a hospital because of all of my mental problems, and honestly wish I could go back sometimes. I was gaslighted for years to believe that my trauma was normal. My home environment was constantly hostile.     I go through long periods of feeling suicidal. Currently in that period. Don't know what to do, honestly. Years of being in therapy and being prescribed pills and yet I still am nowhere near being close to healthy. Looking back, I can't even remember the last time I was genuinely happy. The periods of my sadness last longer than my periods of calm. I'm so afraid of waking up when I'm 40 and still feeling the same way I do now.     The thing about being an adult that spent their entire teenage years thinking they would have killed themselves by now is realizing that your mental illnesses have real repercussions. I have fucked bones and a fucked stomach because of an eating disorder that lasted so long and a GED because I couldnt find the will to do schoolwork when I was just trying to find the will to live another day and not cut myself again. I can’t afford college because I didn’t do any extracurriculars to get scholarships because the thought of having to stay after school made me want to have a panic attack and i just wanted to sleep. I have no friends because when people invited me to hang out my anxiety made me cry myself to sleep instead. I didn’t have any real thought-out “grand plans” because I was too busy hurting myself and getting high and wanting to kill myself to really sit down and plan things out. I said I wanted to do things but never took the time to think it all through.     It doesnt seem fair that I went through this trauma, had/have all of this mental illness, and now have to do with the repercussions of those illnesses. It doesnt seem fair that I'm suffering so much still. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of trying so fucking hard. I know this is self-pitying and 'emo' but I just don't know what to do.

"Am i a bad friend? I don't know what to do Recently two friends of mine (dating) have cut me off entirely without providing a reason... Let's call them J and K. J is an old friend from years back, when we were kids, and K has been my friend since highschool (approx. Six years). Its happened before that they've cut me off periodically for no given reason, then their idea of making up is inviting me to a party and never speaking of the weeks or months that they had me blocked on social media, when i ask them to explain they get defensive, and say things along the lines of ""you KNOW what you did"" even when i try to explain that no, i actually don't. I've never consciously done anything to hurt them, the one thing i thought it could be was that I'm friends with a girl they dislike, but after recently confronting J its apparently not just that, there's a long list of reasons why I'm a terrible friend but he ""doesn't have time to list them"" or even name one. Feeling insecure about this I've confided in other friends who assure me that I'm not a bad friend, although I've asked that they tell me if i ever act like a bitch.  Back to K and J, they recently went so far as to invite all 3 of my siblings along with a crowd of people they barely know to their housewarming, but made a point to exclude me- when my brother asked why the response was along the lines of I'm ""acting like a bitch"". I've tried just cutting them out but its hard after being friends (i think) for so many years. I've tried extending olive branches, explaining that i don't know what I've done wrong and if they could at least tell me then maybe i could apologize/fix the situation, but J responded with passive aggression and K, so far, hasn't responded at all. (Quite frankly i don't expect her to).   Bottom line is, should i just cut them off entirely? Its hard since I'll be seeing a lot of K this year as we're studying the same course, and J is one of my brother's best friends.

My parents only having expectations for me to succeed just makes me feel like the biggest failure of my brothers. Which not only is bullshit but also makes me just not try in the first place a lot of the time. Because if I try and fail its worse because I’m expected to succeed.  I don’t even understand why they expect me to be the successful one. I barely got acceptable grades in high school until senior year when I just took easy courses. I failed English and nearly failed Spanish in 9th grade because I was too lazy to put in any effort. I barely ever brought home friends or did extracurricular activities most of high school. But for some reason I’m their grand vision for who’s gonna make the family proud. ,1,parent having expectation succeed just make feel like biggest failure brother not bullshit make just not try place lot time try fail worse expected succeed not understand expect successful one barely got acceptable grade high school senior year just took easy course failed english nearly failed spanish th grade lazy effort barely brought home friend did extracurricular activity high school reason grand vision gonna make family proud
"I have never met or know what my real father looked like. That changed this week. Also I found out I have two more sisters. So, my wife's family is really into ancestry and tracing lineage all the way back they can. Because of this, my wife really wanted to do 23andme and, being the good husband I try to be, I got her kits as a gift. Fast forward to Monday, the day I got my reports back. I'm scrolling through, ooo'ing and aww'ing at the things I didn't know, and then I go to their DNA relative section. Now, my wife had a few 3rd or 4th cousins who did the kit as well. Not me. I had one half sister listed. I was immediately stunned, because I only knew my real father's name and this girl had his last name. After sending a few messages, we find out that, yes in fact, she is my other half-sister (I have a half-brother and two other half-sisters)! Not only that, but I have two other half-sisters!   My whole world was turned upside down this week. Prior to this, I had no interest in finding or knowing my real father. But, after seeing his picture for the first time and seeing how my sisters revere him. I am considering it. ON TOP OF THAT, this whole turn of events is like a Lifetime movie plot. Sadly he was in a car accident last week and was in critical condition. Even if I wanted to reach out, I don't think now is a good time.

"What can I do in this situation? After graduating high school last summer, I stopped hanging out with all my friends. Some just stopped contacting me since they now live far away living in dorms and such..and others I dropped because they were fake. Sometimes I do sort of regret it, but that's only because of the loneliness and boredom I feel home alone on a weeknight. I'm currently taking a year off and I only have one close friend. I've only known this friend for a year but we got along so well. We had soo many things in common. But now I feel like he's super fake. For ex, he talks crap about his ""friends"" but then posts photos and acts all nice and friendly around them. When he talks about them with me, it genuinely sounds like he hates them and says he never wants to hangout with them..but then does??. Not only that, but nowadays whenever we hang all he seems to do is complain and judge other people. Like, at first it use to be ok..but now it's all the time. It's so toxic and just a cheap form of communication imo. He's also always late whenever we schedule a meetup. Not once was he ever on time, sometimes he makes me wait an hour because he took his time to get ready when he knows that I'm waiting for him. We also never get to do what I want to do anymore because he's ""lazy"". For ex, I really wanted to go to this cute cafe and he also did too..but then on the day of he was taking so long to get ready we ended up not having time to go. We only get to do what I want if he's benefitting from it. Just thinking about this makes me wanna go to him right now and let out all my anger at his face. I do confront him, but it's almost as if he forgets. I would tell him that I hate it when he makes fun of my body or rubs whatevers on his hands on my shirt as if it's a tissue but then a couple weeks later he'll do it. ugh. Just recently too..he was telling me about his cousin and how she literally talks crap about everyone which led to me asking if she ever talked about me. He said yes and she basically called me weird just because of my face shape. I know it's nothing serious but it made me mad because I'm super self conscious about it. But what made me even more mad was the fact that my so called ""friend"" didn't even stick up for me. He didn't tell her to stop or anything.   Sorry that this turned into a rant, but I really wanted some advice. I feel so lonely. When he hangout I feel as I have to be this super fun person because he seems to talk about how his other friends are so fun when he hangs out with me. It wasn't always like this..maybe we're growing apart from each other, I don't know, but I'm purposely taking a break from him for two weeks..we scheduled a meetup for his bday but idk how that'll go.

" well well well, i starting a new blog b/c im bored and my friend thought that this would be a good idea. But today was not a good day for me though. I was going to go watch a movie, Spiderman 2 today with friends, so got up around 8:30am today and started my cleaing early so i wouldn't have to worry about it later in the day and can get ready for the movies too. So i walked toward my room and this dumb crate was in my way and i stubbed my baby toe on the crate and part of my toe nail came off and i broke it, eerrr! It seems as though bad things only happen to me, oh well. But all day i was in freak'n pain and didn't think much about it untill the sharp pain started getting worse and worse through out the day. So now im on pain killers that are making me feel so weird and in a twilight zone it seems like, that i've been trying to sleep through out the whole day to get my mind off the pain. I even tried to watch BarberShop 2 which didn't work b/c my mind was defiantly on my pain. I thought that i can really take pain but i thought wrong lol.

"Hi! We are YourAmigo Hi!  I’m A.M. and I’m writing to introduce a new initiative named YourAmigo. Basically we are a group of friends that have to decided to form this initiative to help anyone who need an “amigo” (Spanish word for friend).

We don’t accept donations, though if anyone wants to help us or has any suggestions, feel free to contact us.

We want to hear your stories, we want you to tell us whatever you’d like to say. In the end we just want you to feel heard. And of course, you will never be judged.  You know guys, we have all been there, in that cold and lonely place. For some, this place will be terrifying and called depression, for others it might be something less severe. But we don’t care. If it is important enough for you to feel bad about it, then it would be an honor for us to hear about it.   Here’s how we work: below you have the email address where you can find us. Please write us. In your first email, you can tell us anything you want, though a little bit of your story is always welcomed (though not required!). And that’s it!

"The divorce talk The wife and I have had a very empty and distant relationship over the last few years.  After a couple of very difficult circumstances in our lives we sought counseling several times which didn't help at all so we resigned ourselves to being basically roommates for the sake of our children.  Neither of us cheated BTW or at least I didn't.  We decided to talk last evening and alot came out.  We're ready to call it quits.  I knew the relationship was dead but thought we would eventually come around.  I love her and am committed to her.  She ""loves me but is not in love with me"" anymore.  I'm scared of what this will do to our kids the oldest is very sensitive.  We decided to try a thing. We're going give ourselves X months and set aside time every evening to really talk about the things that bother us, the things that brought us to this situation, what we fear for it kids, what we want for our lives, all of it while doing it best to accept/not judge the other person.  We have not really spoken to each other like this since before the kids so this may help.  If this doesn't change the relationship we'll decide whether we'll separate or divorce.  I have not told her this but I will be considering the option of suicide since I feel it would be easier for the children to cope with my death than to give them any reason to believe it was in any way their fault.",0,divorce talk wife distant relationship year couple difficult circumstance life sought counseling time did not help resigned basically roommate sake child cheated btw did not decided talk evening alot came out ready quits knew relationship dead thought eventually come around love committed her love not love me anymore scared kid oldest sensitive decided try thing going x month set aside time evening really talk thing bother u thing brought situation fear kid want life doing best acceptnot judge person not really spoken like kid help doe not change relationship decide separate divorce not told considering option suicide feel easier child cope death reason believe way fault
"Awaiting the downward spiral. Had an awesome weekend with a whole bunch of friends from online who all came together, from all around Australia, for three days of drinking and festivities. Now I've travelled home and I'm all alone again.   It's great that I have so many fantastic friends Online, but it's horrible we all live so far away. I'm already missing them terribly, and feeling down. I know that I'm about to spiral downwards even futher after having gotten drunk for three days. It's inevitable, but I'm trying to prepare.  I'm going to try and draw, spend time with my Service Parrot and submerge myself in my gaming community. To keep myself as positively distracted as I can.   I'm already trapped in an endless loop of thinking about my ex, who I still love and miss so much, and beating myself up. Searching for answers and ways how I could of been a better person for him. He told me he hated me and that I made him feel like a child. But i never intended for my help to make him feel like that.   I tried to support and encourage him with everything. Emotionally and financially. I pushed myself to work 30+hrs a week when I was anxious and depressed because he became so closed off, so we had a roof over our head and food in our belly when we were made homeless. I tried to help him with being motivated to work, and to be able to support himself.  I gave him every part of myself, because I loved him so much. And I keep holding on to things he said, before he forgot what this love really meant to him. And all the love that I gave to him, that never got into him. No matter how hard I tried.  I wish he knew I don't hate him for what he said to me and that my suicide attempts weren't to make him feel guilty. I genuinely wanted to end my life.   The thoughts of whatever I had done for him to hate me weighs so heavy upon me, that I fear to live with a guilt that was my own. I failed to be the person he wanted me to be, but worse; I failed to be the person I needed to be for him.  Now we're 2000km apart and, Emotionally, I'm  struggling to keep my head up. Financially, I know He's struggling too. Everyone keeps teling me I shouldn't care about him, but that just makes me hate myself more, that I do.

"Alcoholic dad It's been like this since I was 6 years old. Just to give information, my family and I lived on a farm before I was six and I rarely got into contact with people outside of my family so I barely knew how to talk and would rather screech and be mad all the time and this led me to be very bad at my own language and have few ""real"" friends. My dad's problem started when he started drinking after the company he worked in shutdown I didn't know about it but my family fought about it without my knowing and I don't even know my siblings that well due to me never having gotten any real attention I just sat in my room while they fought at age six and played a game of Madagascar and shut it out I started understanding at age 10 how bad I was with actual relationships i barely know even now how to initiate discussions with other people or relatives and cryed, everyone started to fight at age 11 now at age 16 my dad drove me and my friend from my other friends due to us having had a LAN (played games) and he almost drove right into the railing of a bridge and that was today now that it wasn't just me who was endangered because of his fucking problem I started getting mad. He barely cares what I say and what my mom says he probably wants to leave my mom but doesn't have the financial expertise or job to do so. I dont know what to do and I barely have the guts to cut myself or anything just banging my head into a wall when my parents aren't home or watching people play games.

" These are just a few of the poems that I have written in my past.  Granted, they ain't the greatest, but in my eyes, they are also not the worst.  I hope if who ever does read these, enjoys them.     This first one I truely like.  Carpe Noctem By C. Kevin McBroom  Spinning yarns and  Spinning tales Of creatures of the night And of banshee wails  They say monsters do not exist Or at least so it seems Tell that to a small boys cries Or a little girls screams  As a clawed paw falls Quietly with each step Behind its opaque eyes  Many secrets are kept  The small creature stalks The night of the moon With nie a sound With a smell of doom  A light through a window Spurs the small beast on Moving swift ever silent For inside is food to feast on  A light scratch at the window Followed by a stifled cry ‘Tis only a small kitten Wanting in from the cold outside  True Thoughts By C. Kevin McBroom  I’m tired of peoples attitudes Treating me as if I am in their servitude People just don’t understand Just because I’m not Exactly as they have planned I feel as though I’m looked down on Try as hard as I might Even when I win, I haven’t won Sometimes I want to Open that final dark door If I do, would I finally win?  Friends fall wayside, as do lovers Once again I am all alone Walking solemnly through the clover Pictures race through my mind I try not to look, is it Because I’m afraid of what I’ll find? I’m better off left alone and silent No one to worry or care about No one for my heart to be sent Tears fall but I laugh in spite I close my eyes to hide myself And finally give up the fight      Personally I've always thought that one was kind of depressing, all suicidal and stuff, but for some odd reason, I still like it.  Seasons By C. Kevin McBroom  In the sleepy summer sunset  I remember your bright eyes Reassuring and softly staring Reflective of the clearest blue skies  During the wild winter winds As the snow covered the ground We walked hand in hand At night you chased away the cold dark shroud  In sun-filled spring days Your lovely laughter filled the air As we rolled in and over the clover Life was without a single care  In the sleepy summer sunsets I remember your bright eyes       I wrote that last one for my now wife.  I know it is sort of corny and hallmark-ish,(Is that a word?), but I like the picture it brings to mind and it is probably the least syrupy poem that I wrote to her.

"I'm not sure where to start.  I've been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, disassociation, and bipolar.  I'm also a cutter, suicidal, I hear things and see things.  Needless to say I don't deal with stress very well.   Sorry this isn't a good introduction; but I really do need some help.  I'm a college student only because the VA (veterans Affairs) is paying for it through their vocational - rehabilitation program.  I'm unemployed.  For 3 months I've been fighting with social services just to get food stamps.  I finally got them.  Beforehand food was scarce.  I've had eviction notices and by miracles my roommate and I manage to get just enough money to not get evicted at the last minute.  I've missed class and 2 therapy and other doctor appointments because I haven't had the gas money to get there.  I apply for jobs every day, but I have absolutely no luck getting a job.  So with all this any normal person would become naturally depressed.  But me, I'm losing my mind.  I can be happy and laughing and goofing off with my boyfriend one minute; but the next I'm kicking and hitting and seriously hurting him.  Then we end up in some stupid argument where all I say is shut up or go away, or whatever.   I just don't want to hear it.   I know missing my therapy appointments hasn't helped.  I do have a psychiatrist appointment in 2 weeks and a therapy appointment in 3 weeks.  But I need some help now.   I've lost all my motivation to do anything.  I've been in bed today for 17 hours and I just feel so angry.  Angry and fearful.  The only thing is that I don't know what I'm angry and fearful about.   My mood shifts so quickly and swiftly that I've lost complete control of who or what I am.  The more I try to relax the Angrier and more fearful I get.  It's like I have to stay occupied just to keep my mind occupied and keep it from traveling a million miles a second.  I just need to get back on the semi - sane track.

" Through time all the conflict in society essentially boils down to either greed, power,  or a difference in opinions otherwise unresolvable. From the biggest wars to a fight on the playground it's always one of those 3 things. So you might be wondering what the hell that has to do with anything. My point out of that is that conflict is inevitable and necessary. I can't stand people who think everyone should just tolerate everything even if it conflicts with their own personal views. That's like telling me I should hold out my hands and let someone take a shit on them and like it. Do you have to agree with me, Hell No! Do I have to agree with you, Hell No! What if we just can't come to an agreement............then it's time for a fight! I do have to tell you something.........while you were picking daisys and doing drugs and watching TV.........I was working out, eating right and learning how to fight.

"Can/Should I send her a dm? Hi   I‘ll start this with some backstory. A friend of mine plays in a band and last weekend I watched them live for the first time, it was pretty small with four other bands and maybe 15 people watched my friends band.  Anyway their lead singer is a girl who gave some weird vibes while on stage, but she was also very edgy so maybe it was that.  After the concert someone showed me her IG and I thought I‘d follow her. She and approved me and followed back. The first post she made after that was pretty much this summarized: I am having a pretty bad phase of depression right now. I have no motivation, cant take compliments serious, hate everything I do and am overwhelmed with the smallest social interactions (there was more but I‘ll stop here).   I personally have been struggling for the past few weeks with similar issues again and thought if it was okay to send her a message along the lines of this or if it would be intrusive:  Hey I saw your Post about your depression and can relate a lot to yo. I am a friend of guy and saw you live for the first time in city.  I know how shit it feels to have phases like this and won’t say it becomes magically better, but you are doing an amazing job with your music.  I know you don’t know me and I don’t know you, but if you want to talk to someone who comprehend what you are feeling, I would gladly do it.

To me,  that is important than anything else because I would gladly be able to live with that when I one day be out of this earth. I'm not the goal oriented type.  Its not about climbing this ladder of life. I'm not here for any of what most people are striving for.  I seek for my spirit to settle for all these years.  That is what I'm chasing.  Most people are chasing dreams,  families,  success,  marriages,  money,  respect,  and fame,  but not this human.  More power to them and I'm sure they will obtain all those things but I for one am not seeking to obtain.  The human game is a serious thing filled with losses and wins.  I don't wanna count anymore nor try to get to the next level of life.  Cycling through the infinite regrets and regression. The only goal is for this spirit to settle some type of way.  I'm gunning for an internal calmness.  Something that can penetrate and flood the mind of mine.  Something that can provide some internal at ease like affect for myself.

"Been depressed for so long that i cant remember the last time i was myself. Hey guys this is my first post here and i dont know where else to go. Ive been in a dark place for a long time but im the kind of person who channels this into humor so not even my family could tell. I just turned 20 yesterday and ive been depressed for about 2 years now. I havent opened up to anyone about it because i keep brushing it aside thinking it would pass but it just keeps getting worse. Today i realized something that made me genuinely cry, i seriously didnt remember the last time i was myself. I used to be super carefree and relaxed, i was full of energy and would answer any call to chill in seconds. I just asked my close friend when was the last time he remembers the real me and he said it was the beginning of college and im currently finishing my second year. Its been getting progressively worse in the last 6 months with a serious drop in my appetite.  I also started feeling anxiety for the first time in my life and suicidal thoughts are uncommon Ive lost about 10 pounds in 2 months because of this. My grades also took a hard hit, going from a 3.0 gpa every semester to a 1.7. I just had a talk with my mom and she told me that im being ungrateful and that i need to get my shit together (ironic considering she suffered depression for years until i pushed her to divorce my father).  Im not blaming her at all for my situation because she was raised by two hardasses so i understand why its hard for her to understand why a teen would be depressed. I know that life is worth it and it gets better but i really cant keep the darkness out of my head. Weed has kept me sane for a while but quitting recently caused it to come back full force and i really need advice on how to get back on track.

"Feeling Trapped Hello,  I am 22 and had quite severe depression during the age of 17-18. My past 3 years of life from the ages 19-22 have actually been great and I have had no problems. I have had a girlfriend since the age of 20 whom I love. I have worked a few different mundane jobs, and have been going to school for electrical engineering. I am entering my last year of undergraduate school in the ASU online program.   The reason my depression has returned is because I feel trapped, mainly due to my living situation. I would consider my upbringing to be the low end of middle class, and yes I realize there are people much worse off than I am. I grew up in a family of 6, 2 parents and 4 siblings including myself. For the past 18 years we have lived in an 1800 sq. ft.  town house in California, right off of a busy street. There are 2 rooms in the house. The master bedroom is rather large, I would estimate about 2.5x as big as the other bedroom. Up until a few months ago when my sister moved out, all 4 of us siblings were sharing the smaller room. Now there are 3 of use sharing it, but still two bunk beds taking up the same space. There is absolutely no space, and I am 6'3"" tall and do not really fit into my twin size bunk bed. My mom has kept the large master bedroom for herself over the years, and has forced my father to sleep in the living room, despite the fact that he is the one who pays the bills. She is a selfish person. My desk, which is where I try to study and work, and where I spend most of my time, is in the living room. My dad is usually in the living room watching TV, and there are lots of noise and distractions from other people and the kitchen etc.  which make it nearly impossible to study or just relax.   This didn't really bother me much as a kid, but now that I am 22, it is getting worse and worse everyday. Because I do online schooling (which was not what I intended) , I have little to no interaction with peers and my schooling is basically sitting in front of my computer at home. I feel completely trapped. The bedroom I share is completely cramped, and usually one of my other siblings is in it. In the living room I am surrounded by distractions and other people, with absolutely no privacy. It is hard to study or focus on anything. I feel like I have no space to myself, like there is nowhere to go. I often feel extremely anxious and depressed, and feel as though someone is cramming me into a box. This makes me just want to cease being conscious. All I think about is how badly I need to move out. Every night it is getting worse and worse, until I decided to come here tonight to post.   Due to school payments, and buying a car, it is not possible to move out with the mediocre job that I have. There is still another year until I graduate school, and even then I don't know for certain if I will be able to get a job that will enable me to move out. I will still have to pay off school loans after that. The thought of staying here for another year, or even worse 2-3 years is completely unbearable. My girlfriend and I have made plans to move out together eventually, but that probably wouldn't happen for another 2 years minimum. This had made me extremely depressed and anxious the past 6 months. Does anyone have any advice for what I should do? I have been considering spending more time at libraries during the day.  I have also been trying to spend a little more time outside and at the gym etc. But if anyone else has been in a similar situation, please give me advice.   Note: I know there are people who have it much worse. Homeless, disabled, etc. I realize that and that is the main thing that I try to think about when I feel depressed and anxious. That I have it better than some people. But this is just my personal situation I am trying to deal with.

Okay so I'm doing a really shitty job of keeping up with this journal. So Sam came and went. Not before I went to a wedding and got drunk and told her parents that I was in love with her . Yea.. umm.. I'm gay. I then told her that I thought moving to Oregon was a bad bad idea. Not because I was in love with her but because moving to a city for a boy that you're in love with but has no interest in you. Not such a good idea. so anyways that made things all fucked up and she left and we weren't on the best terms  besides that the roommate thing just kind of fell apart. I didn't get the apartment across from shaye because of credit issues. So now I'm going to just move into her place. We'll see how that turns out... If we kill each other or not. I'm not on the lease so if it sucks I can just move out  there are a few boys that are into me. However I don't think that my soul really wants to be with anyone right now. I have something wrong with my heart  I'm doing blood work on Monday to figure out what's going on. And I took last week off for no reason at all. So I guess a lot has happened in the last 15 days. I should really try to keep up with this journal.,1,okay doing really shitty job keeping journal sam came went not went wedding got drunk told parent love yea umm gay told thought moving oregon bad bad idea not love moving city boy love you not good idea anyways thing fucked left not best term roommate thing just kind fell apart did not apartment shaye credit issue going just place turn out kill not not lease suck just boy me not think soul really want right now wrong heart doing blood work monday figure going on took week reason all guess lot happened day really try journal
"Brother rage attack my grandmother My brother is prone to rage attacks. Him and I had that classic ""brother love"" growing up. Anyways this isn't about me it's about my grandmother.   So my grandma from my mom's side came from out of the country to live with us for a couple months (my brother and I still live with our mom). To help with housework and see our family.   She is the one of the sweetest ladies out there. Typical caring loving person, very sensitive and full of love &amp; happiness. Now my brother comes into the equation... he's had his rage bursts with me  and I've learned to deal with it as well as my mother. They say how you treat your mom is how you treat your wife.  Honestly, he's so disrespectful to my mom at times it makes me vehement. What can I do come in and save the day (when I have done in the past it only made things worse).   Anyways, I thought I knew my brother well and knew he wouldn't dare yell at my grandma. OMG boy was I wrong he crossed that line. A rage attack came at my grandma with yelling and this time I did intervene.   After things settled I consoled my grandma she was shocked, sad, unable to believe he was like this. So I told her the truth he has always been like this and I feel just as much pain as she felt becuase seeing her distraught was one of the most depressing things I have ever witnessed. She wants to leave and go back although I can tell she is worried for me &amp; my mom.   Hate to break the news baba but ya he's a fucking entitled narcisstic pieces of shit on the planet. I understand when guys  blow steam with other guys but seriously to your own mother and grandmother. I think it's completely unacceptable and disrespectful.   Note: our dad is not involved because he doesnt live with us or see us often  I left a lot of details however, you understand the picture.    Question: He will not change, I think as a family we should distance ourselves from him carefully.

"My friend is ruining her frienships I'm not really sure what to do here. My best friend, let's call her Sam, has lost a lot of friendships recently. And I mean a lot. In the past two years, she's lost almost every close friendship she's ever had. The count is in the double digits. Something would happen and she'd declare them dead to her and never speak to them again. Unfortunately, I find myself usually feeling like it's Sam's fault that the friendships are crumbling. Recently, she's started shamelessly using her friends. One girl worked as a seamstress at a community theater in her free time and Sam would constantly arrive unannounced and drop off clothes she wanted tailored, imposing absurd timeline, even saying she'd be back that night to pick the dresses up. When her friend finally asked Sam to start paying, Sam announced to everyone that their friendship was over and that she refused to associate with someone who didn't view her as a friend. She's started yelling at people for not texting her more. She called one of her now former friends, an elementary school teacher, and yelled at her for not responding to her texts about where they were going to get dinner that night. She wanted to make sure she didn't eat the same type of food for lunch. The teacher cancelled and they haven't spoken since. And unfortunately, with each new friend lost, her demands on those remaining have become more and more extreme. Her need for attention has gotten out of hand. She demands that we all hang out four nights a week and constantly accuses people of not valuing her friendship enough if they can't make it. One friend spent every night with her one week trying to show Sam that she mattered. When the friend didn't continue that schedule the next week, Sam screamed at them for pulling away and called her a coward for not just ending it if she didn't want to be friends. Worst of all, she accuses people of saying things they've never said, claiming that she's stupid, she can read between the lines. And when people try to explain that they never intended to hurt or upset her, she claims that it doesn't matter what they said. What matters is how she was made to feel. It shouldn't come as a surprise that Sam has serious self-esteem issues. She's in therapy and has been for a while, trying to work on them. Unfortunately, she goes back and forth between crying that no one knows how hard it is to live with ""being such a failure"" and accusing others of not being deserving of her friendship. I want to be there for her. I want to help. She's been my best friend and she used to be able to be there for me, but I'm not sure I can handle who she's become and how she's started treating us. tl;dr: My friend has serious self-esteem issues and is ruining all of her friendships because she treats everyone like absolute garbage. She's getting therapeutic help but I'm not sure I'm able to stick around long enough for things to get better.",0,friend ruining frienships not really sure here best friend let sam lost lot friendship recently mean lot past year lost close friendship had count double digit happen declare dead speak again unfortunately usually feeling like sam fault friendship crumbling recently started shamelessly using friend girl worked seamstress community theater free time sam constantly arrive unannounced drop clothes wanted tailored imposing absurd timeline saying night pick dress up friend finally asked sam start paying sam announced friendship refused associate did not view friend started yelling people not texting more called friend elementary school teacher yelled not responding text going dinner night wanted make sure did not eat type food lunch teacher cancelled not spoken since unfortunately new friend lost demand remaining extreme need attention gotten hand demand hang night week constantly accuses people not valuing friendship make it friend spent night week trying sam mattered friend did not continue schedule week sam screamed pulling away called coward not just ending did not want friend worst all accuses people saying thing said claiming stupid read line people try explain intended hurt upset her claim doe not matter said matter feel not come surprise sam selfesteem issue therapy while trying work them unfortunately go forth cry know hard live being failure accusing not deserving friendship want her want help best friend used able me not sure handle started treating u tlr friend selfesteem issue ruining friendship treat like absolute garbage getting therapeutic help not sure able stick long thing better
"Estranged mum possibly dying Hi so I'm basically in need of some help here with a big issue from people who have possibly experienced something similar. So it's a long story and I'll try and keep it to the parts the are mine to tell to keep things less complicated. So first things first me and my mother have had a somewhat rocky relationship from since I can remember, it was more of a rollercoaster and have been estranged for a year. Although the intense emotional disrupt from the relationship has lasted much longer.  A brief history of this would be as follows, since a young age my mum has never been the ""settle down type"" she was always away either to holidays guys she would meet online would take her on too out every weekend. Me and my sister had to learn fast from a young age that we weren't able to live a childhood like most of our friends and basically raise our little brother. Sometimes she would be caught leaving us alone for so long and we'd have to stay with her friends so she wouldn't get in trouble and others we'd have to just make sure not to miss school so she wouldn't get caught. After years of this repeated behaviour some days easier some harder living from feast (when mum would bag herself a wealthy guy) too mum didn't win at bingo this week and a 40 fag a day habit is expensive habit to keep up why don't you just have beans on toast tonight, ofcourse I know that this is better than alot of kids we had a roof over our head and food in our stomachs it was always just chaos. Cut forward to my mum deciding she wanted to move back to ireland. I was about 10 at the time and and as such didn't want to move that's when the abuse went from none of my boyfriend's stay because of my kids too physical, she had us all so scared saying that while we were staying with grandad and granny and they heard us complaining this is what we'd get she kick us or grab us, I had been beaten before by my dad before he left so this was nothing I couldn't handle and until now never really tried to think about since. I just remember that I stayed very quiet for those coming weeks. When we moved to Ireland it was just after the first week a man showed up at my grandparents came in kissed my mum and said hello to me and my sister and said he was so glad to meet us. Turned out he was engaged to mum.....and they were planing on being married within the year, all of a sudden the reason for moving became clear. So After the breakdown of their relationship the next week the man moved back to America in the night and that was that here we were living with my grandparents in Ireland with no where else to go, my mum a big believer of why would I have to work I have kids stuck. Now I know from mum's point of view this must of been a heart breaking moment, but looking back I think this is where alot of my sadness in life begins and I hate her for it. I know hate is a horrible thing to hold onto but it's the only thing that got me where I am today and kept me as a person and I'm definitely aware I'm no Ghandi so judge me all you want but wait until I'm finished atleast.  The next few months were basically limbo, we moved too late to start the term at school so had to wait until the end of term and summer to join, that's from April till September if I'm remembering right of living in the middle of nowhere in Ireland, sleeping in a room with your young brother older sister nothing to do but wait for the day to end we would take walks here or there and get to go to mass on a Saturday night but minus that it's all we had I realised then that mum had failed to do the one thing that kept giving me hope that one day we could have a ""normal"" family she was nowhere to be found off on holidays for weeks one after the other while our grandparents fed us and kept us in their home. I remember a week going by without hearing anything from her and I had to assume that's it she's gone.  Yet she came back this time more shiny and brand new then ever, she said she had found us a house not to far away and go to school and it was the start of our new life. So ofcourse I felt overwhelmed at how amazing this might actually be. Mum made sure though to show her appreciation that Christmas by starting a huge family row with my her brothers and my grandparents, they had all chipped in to buy me and my siblings bigger toys for Christmas, I got a playstation 2 my sister got clothes and makeup and a bike my brother got lego ect that kind of thing, now Christmas was never a thing for us mum had explained from a young age that the santa thing was a lie and we would get what she could afford again this is not as bad as it sounds I'd rather the truth always and she at the end of the day was a single mother why would we expect anything ""big"" so ofcourse she didn't like the gesture and disowned everyone there etc But we were moving to new house and starting a new life what more could I have wanted. So after living in the new house for a week mum decided that now my sister was 14 she could come on a ""girls"" holiday with her and as such they went the next week I think my sister was just happy to be out of school so went plus I didn't mind my brother was older and didn't need as much attention any more so I kinda looked forward to it, after they came back my sister let me know that she had done it again and gotten engaged and tried to warn me I guess that atleast I could know beforehand this time, the guy she was engaged to worked abroad the entire time so mum basically worshipped the computer so she could talk to him all the time she would sleep the same time as him (during the day) and be up all night, if ever the internet would go down or the house wasn't cleaned or dinners weren't in the house she would freak sometimes more physical then not, up until the day she said we were moving again so long story short the guy moved over they were engaged I was still never told by my mother and I had to sit through the guy explaining how he was gonna be my new dad for 4 hours while we drove to our new home, setting the scene it was a country bungalow which hadn't been lived in for years but me and my sister had done stuff like this in the past so we started into doing it up mum didn't like the physical side of it but loved the planning so she kept busy for a while, quick side note, I loved school, hated the abuse for being the English guy in an Irish school, I had ended up in hospital etc due to some of the abuse, we lived quite happily for a while until my ""new dad"" went back abroad to work for the summer, I started work that summer and so did my sister, my mum would be obcessed with my step dad when he was working who he saw etc until she decided he was definitely cheating (he wasnt) and decided she would too, she spent ages trying to get me and my sister to set up dating profiles for her and to cover on the phone if ever she was out on dates, when he returned as you could imagine arguments between them started and one thing my mother is good at is arguing she was always able to make him think he had done something wrong and she did nothing it didn't help that mum would threaten to throw us out if we ever told him what happened. So that was us for a while weeks of calm and weeks of arguing. Mum must have decided to quit the online dating world for a while and started into online poker, she would find out how much we would earn and take that as rent and spend it on online poker, she would take out debts, spend it on online poker, take my stepdads wages, spend it on online poker, this isn't a film so I won't say she was ever good or ever won, or more anything she did win didn't go straight back in. That summer we went with my step dad to his job abroad the company only could afford a one bed flat for the five of us and to keep stuff private I won't say place names but it was a tropical island, 5 people, one bedroom, one bathroom and since there was a casino down the road thanks to mum no money. That's when I realised that no matter how seemingly redicoulous the situation we were just furniture in mum's whirlwind lifestyle. One instance I'll go into detail would be this one from that summer. I had saved  £300 pound in secret we didn't have enough money for clean water or food for the next 4 days so I thought you know what I'll just say that I had a little bit of money I didn't realise I had and buy food etc. So I did, mum seen the food swore and gave off loads had me return it and took the money to the casino.....that is one instance of many.  So after that summer mum went back to her online poker and we went back to normal until the next summer when mum decided she wanted to go to America with a friend from online, no prize for guessing what kind of friend, and that's the summer when I kind of shut down, I stopped eating and I stopped caring, I finally thought maybe if I very quietly and very slowly wasted away it would all be ok I didn't need to be around. I would cook everyone else's Meals and just say I had something to eat while cooking, I lost 4 stone in 2 months. Even as im typing this its hard to write. I talked to my mother once in those two months, the time she had no money and needed help. I went into auto pilot I would wake up clean the house play playstation with my brother make dinner and stay up till 3 in the morning with background noise sometimes I cut myself sometimes I would exercise till I vomited, I was slowly dying and that goal was what got me through the day that one day hopefully I wouldn't wake up, my sister was too busy with her new boyfriend and I didnt want to ruin her happiness my brother was too young to understand I thought and my step dad just wanted a clean house and for what he was wearing to work and eating at work to be sorted.   So then the message came that mum wanted us to come to America and stay with her for a bit. Once there at the airport was the first time I'd seen my mum cry. The first time shed shown genuine concern for me, in fairness being ""big boned"" in our family was normal we are tall and none of us underweight, and there I stood 16 years old 6ft1 and a total of 8 stone must of been mad for her I guess. So if you guessed it right remember no prizes she was in America with another man he like all of mum's affairs seemed nice but not really in it for the kids they would have their relationship and we would be in the background. A million times o wanted to tell the poor guy but being stranded in a different continent didn't seem like something that we could get out off so I kept quiet. Things went on as they would mum would act like she was single and we'd have to agree with whatever lie she told. Her visa ran out and we had to go back home. These times seem like they should involve more but at this point I was too numb to the world I didn't register it I would live in the lie I had to and disconnect.  Mum and my stepdads relationship continued to take on more strain every time with more and more intensity. Mum did try a little more to be a mother to me and even took me to doctors apointments to help try and deal with my depression and ofcourse I don't blame her for it I had decided what I wanted to do and I am responsible for that. Our relationship improved a little and I actually gained some nice memories.   So in the next year something well something really bad happened to me, I don't like going into too many details but the overall was I taken advantage of by someone I thought I could trust and to this day I still struggle with calling it rape but deep down I know that it was, my sexuality had never been a big deal to me as id always known and never acted on it but I told someone for the first time and well yeah non consenting acts occurred.  The reason why I'm saying this is because Its what lead me to try to come out to my mother, our relationship was at its best and so I felt I needed to tell someone what had happened to me and at the very least try and get some help because I was already mental as fragile as I was.  The long and short is it didn't turn out well, I mean imagine your worst situation and how low you felt. Now sink a little lower.  I tried to tell my friends and get help and if not for one person I don't think I would have made it through.  I still had to finish school though and with only a year left I lived through that situation and my past experiences taught me how to become numb.  Cut to me getting the results I needed and getting into the course I wanted.   I moved out after much arguing and for the first time I was free to be the person I knew I could be, I made so many new friends i gained weight for the first time I was always independent and knew I was happy. Like actually happy.  I met a guy the most thoughtful caring person and still to this day I think I'm glad I didn't die because every day is worth whatever he'll I went through  Stuff with mum was still messy but it was away and in it's neat little box of past baggage. She would ring and talk about a new guy she met and then talk about how much she loves my step dad.  I finally thought you know what last chance I'm going to tell her about the guy in my life and if she didn't like it then I could move on and understand that maybe she wasn't supposed to understand and leave it at that but to my suprise she seemed fine with it.  Weeks past he met my family and my mum was lovely it was weird like she was a different person out relationship became so much better she still borrowed money shed never give back and cheated but we could talk about other things normal things.  Things continued with their ups and downs for a few years I carried on being happy and asked the guy to marry me which he said yes too. That's when the bigger troubles started.  So a quick list. Mum wouldn't allow him to keep the engagement ring on. She demanded monthly visits regardless of what was happening Started alienating his family and comparing their lives and how different they were to us Pitting my brother and sister against me and themselves  And just general, idk mental abuse without sounding too intense it was weird because anytime it would get seriously intense and be basically ruining any day to day stability she would stop and be nice again for a few weeks.   It was unfair to my fiance though alot of the time it felt as if she kept making situations in which he would have to increasingly prove him self with the more he would do. Sometimes it came down to outright having to prove his love to me and became more and more frequent. She started to try and control our wedding ie spending, decor etc.   The event that started the end was when we had to unfortunately rehome our cat due to him not getting along with our dog etc this sent mum berserk she rang my work demanding to speak to me and completely dressed me down on the phone and my fiance and how dare we calling me and my fiance worse than our father's  (both of which had left us as kids) She said we weren't to rehome it and weren't allowed etc. My sister and brother got involved and were repeating my mother's words. Showing the same cycle of go along with mum or terrible things happen.   So then there was an issue with Christmas this is a long one so to keep it short basically how dare I suggest to go to my fiances family even though he had been to ours and how as my mother I am not allowed at this point I'm 23 years old.  Straw that broke the camel's back, mum's dog unfortunately died, and with work I wasn't able to make it down and neither was my fiance, we were barred from the ""open house"" they decided to do for the dog and we received phone calls daily calling us all the names under the sun. My fiance had recently got a job with the nhs and was starting it on the Monday and as such said on Facebook he was happy to about this. Now I got a phone call from my mother but it wasn't a sane person it was unbelievable and to this day still scares me, from moments maniacal laughter to screaming to whispering she did it all at how dare he be happy on the day her dog was being cremated......it was some scary stuff like I am a huge animal lover yes but the way she felt personally attack that someone had something good in their life when she didnt that day was disturbing. That night my sister calls and is basically the same except for the line ""if you can't attend dog funerals then we can't attend weddings"" and that was it. That was the moment.   I hung up the phone saying I wish them happiness and health and that if this is the way it is then that's it.  And that was it I blocked them from contacting me and had one of the best years of my life.  I have become mentally stronger, I am happier and I'm well I feel like the person I'm supposed to be.  Until today I get a message from an account on Instagram ""mum has cancer can you give me a number to contact you on""  Now in all this I haven't even mentioned everything like the fact mum has pretended to have a heart attack before and has lied about equally as worse.  I know it's a horrible thing to not want to reach out after a message like that but I don't want to go back to the pain I was in before I feel like can't breathe when I even think about giving my number and know that even if it's true and she does have cancer that I could never have a relationship that isn't toxic with these people I need advice and help but mostly I needed to share so thanks if ya read this far there's so much to this and I feel like I haven't even mentioned half the stuff that happened but please do I stick to social norms and try and be a good son or do I put my mental health first.

"Does anyone else get very angry at just stupid little things?  It seems like over the last few months everyone around me is getting all they want out of life, and I am suffering with depression.  Which, of course, makes me feel worse and then I feel guilty for not being happy for them.  BUT, I also get angry when they ""flaunt"" their happiness around me.  My roommate just started seeing someone she met off eharmony.  We both signed up at the same time for fun, and while I was rejected time and time again, she was SO picky and then started seeing the first guy she went out with.  I am happy that she found someone and she really deserves it, but I get so ANGRY that she is constantly doing things with him.  It's like I've been replaced.  I feel like a 5 year old for thinking that, but I just can't help how I feel.  Today, for example, I asked her if she wanted to watch a movie I had gotten off our digital cable.  We have it until 9 tonight and she said she'd like to.  I was pretty excited seeing as how I hadn't been invited to a couple of events this weekend in lieu of ZACH going.  Well, she just came down stairs and said that Zach is going to be  coming over now.  This ticks me off because she broke our plans, and I don't have a way to ""escape"" when they are here.  I'm sure she's going to want to watch that movie with Zach, and, I know I'm being selfish, but I don't WANT him here tonight.  I haven't gotten to see Angela all weekend and the one night we have before going back to work HE is going to be here.  So I have to put on my happy face and pretend that I am glad for her and happy that she has someone and engage him in conversation when all I will feel like doing is crying.  It's unfair!  Why does it seem like when you are depressed, everyone around you has these GREAT things happening in their life.  Angela just got a promotion, a new car, and now a new boyfriend.  I am stuck in the same job, same crushing car payment, and I haven't dated anyone in over 6 years.

"Mother is always trying to start something. My mom and I have a rocky relationship, I love my mom but sometimes I absolutely cannot stand her or the things she does. It stems from her depression that she has, but she always blames everything in the world for her problems and never herself. Yesterday, she texted me that my grandparents were moving from our hometown they've lived in since the 80's and to the town where more of our family lives. I sent a picture of my discount card from my job and said they could use it if they needed to buy boxes or moving supplies. She replied with ""That's it no emotion?"" Should I have been more emotional to the situation? I don't blame my grandparents for moving because I moved out of state last year.

Just feeling very isolated right now. It's one of those situations where all I want is for someone to realize I'm drowning. All I want is to be offered a hand up... To feel like I actually matter to someone. I recently lost what I would consider to be my last friend IRL and haven't been out of the house for any reason other than work in weeks.  The person I call a best friend is a person I've known less than six months who lives half way across the country. I've been waiting around hours hoping he will ask me for a phone call. He hasn't. And I don't want to continually pester him since he hasn't offered me a phone call tonight. I don't really know why I'm posting in this group. I guess so maybe I can imagine that someone somewhere will read my current thoughts and maybe I won't feel quite so alone.

" Okay, so I just spent $50.00 bucks on a optical mouse.  It was either that or spend the money on food or shoes.  The new pet is a Logitech MX510 optical mouse, it is a cool maroon color and if you want to buy into the sales pitch each color is unique with no two the same.  The performance spec's are what cinched the deal for me..i did not even know that they had performance specs.  I got 5.8 megapixel per second image processing, 800 DPI resolution, and the solar flare reductor units are top of the line from NASA.  So technically with all this going for me, my online gaming experience should now vastly improve as I fight for world domination with 13 year olds (yeah right).  The one, for real thing is I did find a article about the mouse in Maximum PC magazine.  It got thier trademark (kick ass award).  That has to be worth $50.00 bucks.

"Friend dumps problems on me and that’s all we do together now Interested in other peoples experience of this and suggestions!  Have been friends with a woman for a few years.  Started off fun, we’d go for lunch, gigs and talk about a whole range of topics in person and by text.   For the last 6 months she’s stopped meeting up with me and responding to messages (or sending any). Instead she calls me at least once every week for often 2 - 3 hours asking for advice about men, her job and other stresses. She’ll talk for over 20 mins uninterrupted, won’t stop talking when I need to go and will call even if I’ve said I’ll be out or unavailable.   I got married oversees recently and our conversation was 10 mins on this and the remaining 2 hours about her problems.   She gets aggressive if I don’t offer a solution but when I cave and suggest another way of looking at things she throws it back in my face. She will often cite conversations with others where she’s gotten into an argument, and for hours will push me to give an opinion as to what she did wrong and when I diplomatically suggest doing something different or how maybe the other person didn’t mean it how it came across she will say I don’t defend her and make passive aggressive remarks. She’ll ask me to make decisions and then complains of it doesn’t give her the result she wanted!  It’s confusing and really draining. Not mention all the fun parts of our friendship have slipped away and now I’m left with her constantly calling. If I don’t pick up she just keep ringing everyday! In fact I moved House once and she complained she had withdrawals from our calls.   Feel pretty used as she has little to no consideration of my feelings or boundaries. In fact once on a call with her I received a text saying my grandmother had died, she just said she had to go and never mentioned it again, not even to ask how I was doing.

They referred me to a place where the psychiatrist isn't taking new patients but the psychologists are. They asked me what kind of treatment I needed!!

"I've suffered from depression episodes for about 10 years. Lately, due to major stresses at work, I'm back into feeling awful.

When other employees have physical illness, such as cancer or heart problems my employer rallies around them and makes all sorts of accommodations but I've kept my depression a secret because I'm afraid it will be seen as a character flaw and I'll be fired.

" This is my blog to the world…  …that never blogged to me (apologies to Dickinson, check it out at www.bartleby.com).  What a fitting first posting to my blog!  Clever.  Blogs are the ultimate in one-way communication, brought to us by the infinite self-publishing capabilities of the web.  Children in Beijing and the editorial staff at Al Jazeera can find out with the click of a mouse what I have to say about anything.  Everything!  If it crosses my mind, it will cross theirs, yours, everybody’s.  The good folks at the Independent School Technology Letter have come to yours truly, bloggingman, to get everybody hip to blogs.  Can do.  In fact, we decided to blog our way through the topic, for real.  Is there any other way to communicate?  From me to you.  I am giving Sherry and Will privileges to post to the blog as we go along, so they can help me keep it straight and blog it into shape.  What, you ask, is a blog?  Where you been?  If I spelled it ‘blog, would that give you a clue?  Right, it’s short for web log.  “Log”: noun, a record of performance, events, or day-to-day activities (check it out at www.m-w.com), and you know what “web” is.  I’m keeping track of things in my log, which I publish on the web, hence this is my web log, or blog.    Of course, all blogs exist in the blogosphere.  “Blogosphere (alternate: blogsphere) is the collective term encompassing all weblogs. Weblogs are heavily interconnected; bloggers read other blogs, link to them, and reference them in their own writing. Because of this, the interconnected blogs have grown their own culture” (check it out at: en.wikipedia.org).    Blogs have become incredibly popular, even in schools, which is where I work (identity concealed).  In fact, a guy at NECC this year said “you must blog.”  If I must…  So here I go.  Kinda catchy, “you must blog it.”  When a problem comes along  You must blog it  Before a thought sits out too long  You must blog it  When something's going wrong  You must blog it   now blog it  into shape  shape it up  get straight  go forward  move ahead  try to detect it  it's not too late  to blog it  blog it good   That’s the ticket!

"Questioning the legitimacy of a friendship (very long post) Alrighty. Buckle up, because this post is going to be long. There's gonna be a lot of information tossed at you, so if you're feeling like demolishing a massive wall of text, read on.  A couple years back, I got my first real job. It was great. The people, the work, everything. I become friends with a waitress, which is kind of usual seeing as I've never been able to make friends with a woman before and she's a bit older than me, but that's beside the point. We hit it off as soon as we start working shifts together and talked constantly. She'd occasionally ask me to come out to eat with her, and on a couple occasions we did and both had a great time (as far as I could tell anyway). She'd also suggest that her and I should get together sometime and hang out with another waitress that's she's friends with.  A few months in, my parents discover my friendship with the waitress and immediately assume the worst, e.g. I'm only friends with her for sex/drugs/alcohol, all of which aren't true. They couldn't seem to grasp that we could be just friends despite the age gap. They eventually believe that I'm telling them the truth, but not before one of them calls my boss and tells him that the waitress and I are ""dating"" but I'm too stupid to know it. This puts her in some hot water and she tells me about it the next day. My parents continue bothering me about the friendship with my coworker.   In spite of this, nothing changes between the waitress and I. We still have a great time talking to each other, and I even stay at work for hours after my shift ends to talk with her. Two weeks after my parents find out about my workplace friendship, I turn 18. Suddenly my parents don't care about who I'm friends with anymore, saying that I can make my own choices now. I tell my friend that she doesn't have to worry about my parents being involved anymore, and life is good. She also tells me that she's looking for a roommate, and asks me if I'm interested. Over the course of the next six months, she makes several more offers to hang out with me and her waitress friend, only it never happens. The dates never get nailed down, or I just never hear back from her after I express interest. I chalk it up to forgetfulness or a busy schedule and leave it alone.   Thanksgiving rolls around. I tell my friend that due to pressure from my parents, I'm going to have to quit working and find a full time job. She's sad at first but is still determined to spend time with me despite the fact that I'm quitting. I start my new job and hear nothing from her over the course of two months. This isn't unusual, seeing as we never communicated outside of work before, but I think it's a little strange considering that she was so determined to spend time with me when I said I was quitting.  I stop by work on my day off and she nearly knocks me over when she comes to give me a hug. This is completely unexpected by me because even though we talked a hell of a lot, we never really had any physical contact. She tells me how much she's missed me and had no one else to talk to, and if I'm going to the Christmas party at the end of the month. I hang around for a few hours while we chat and leave when she goes to her other job. Later that night, she texts me saying that it how it was so nice to see me and that she's going to the Christmas party and hopes to see me there.  I go to the Christmas party and we have a great time playing games and cards and eating shitty pizza. We both decide to leave at the same time and she gives me a ride home along with a couple other coworkers. We don't talk again at all until she texts me at work a  month later asking if she can borrow some money. I leave and come give her the money, thinking that it's kind of weird that we've been friends for over a year and I'm just now seeing what her house looks like. We talk for way too long considering that I'm supposed to be at work, but enjoy ourselves anyway.  Later that week, I stop at work on my day off and talk to her for a while before leaving for unrelated reasons. Another month passes with no communication before I stop to see her again, and this time she hardly notices I'm there. The only time that she says something to me is when I outright ask her how she's been, and even then the conversation is uncharacteristically brief. I wonder if there's something on her mind that she's not telling me, seeing as that would explain why she seems so quiet. I decide to not bother and leave her alone.  That weekend I show up to her work after being asked to fill in for someone. Seeing as I had nothing better to do, I take the offer. Unlike last time I was there, my friend seems to be acting like her normal self. We talk for a bit while I work and I go up front to hang around. She tells me that she's going to go home and watch a movie and was wondering if I'd like to swing by after work. I tell her I'd love to and wait for her to call me like she said she would. I never get the call.   That was a couple weeks ago.  I just can't help but feel like all of these offers to spend time with her aren't legitimate offers but rather her faking interest in spending time with me. I wish that there was some way that I could tell her this without coming off as uncaring or needy, but I just don't feel like there's a way to tell her this without coming off as an asshole in one way or another.  Thanks to those that read this or answer. This has been on my mind a lot as of late and it feels good to get it off of my chest.",0,questioning legitimacy friendship very long post alrighty buckle up post going long gonna lot information tossed you feeling like demolishing massive wall text read on couple year back got real job great people work everything friend waitress kind usual seeing able make friend woman bit older me point hit soon start working shift talked constantly occasionally ask come eat her couple occasion did great time a far tell anyway suggest hang waitress friend with month in parent discover friendship waitress immediately assume worst eg friend sexdrugsalcohol not true not grasp just friend despite age gap eventually believe telling truth not call bos tell waitress dating stupid know it put hot water tell day parent continue bothering friendship coworker spite this change waitress i great time talking other stay work hour shift end talk her week parent workplace friendship turn suddenly parent not care friend anymore saying make choice now tell friend doe not worry parent involved anymore life good tell looking roommate asks interested course month make offer hang waitress friend happens date nailed down just hear express interest chalk forgetfulness busy schedule leave alone thanksgiving roll around tell friend pressure parent going quit working time job sad determined spend time despite fact quitting start new job hear course month not unusual seeing communicated outside work before think little strange considering determined spend time said quitting stop work day nearly knock come hug completely unexpected talked hell lot really physical contact tell missed talk to going christmas party end month hang hour chat leave go job later night text saying nice going christmas party hope there christmas party great time playing game card eating shitty pizza decide leave time give ride home couple coworkers not talk text work month later asking borrow money leave come money thinking kind weird friend year just seeing house look like talk way long considering supposed work enjoy anyway later week stop work day talk leaving unrelated reason month pass communication stop again time hardly notice there time say outright ask been conversation uncharacteristically brief wonder mind not telling me seeing explain quiet decide not bother leave alone weekend work asked someone seeing better do offer unlike time there friend acting like normal self talk bit work hang around tell going home watch movie wondering like swing work tell love wait like said would call couple week ago just help feel like offer spend time not legitimate offer faking spending time me wish way tell coming uncaring needy just not feel like way tell coming asshole way another thanks read answer mind lot late feel good chest
"How does it feel to have an abnormal next of kin? I have a brother who people call ""retarded"". But actually he's not. Just family - the one voluntarily has patience with him understand that.  When I was a kid, I only thought he had some illusions about life because he had always talking about unreal things. We were watching TV and the editors were discussing some news, instead of listening and talking about related topics (as normal people do) he started to shout that they were stupid and made up his own story that us all knew it told no true information. If it's your family's case, maybe your parents would try to talk to him or do something, but mine did nothing. When I argued with him over such false information, my parents even stopped me and said ""Why do you have to argue with your poor brother?"" I thought they would never tell him what's wrong and what's right.  At age of 10, once he told me to pack things up 'cause we would go for a trip with my mom's friends, I had no doubt and did exactly what he had said. Of course, one day later I found out he lied. At that moment, he looked at me with his wicked eyes and laughed. That's the moment I realized he's such an attention seeker, he's selfish and just wanted the world to turn around himself. Since then, my parents never listen to me as I say he's not a fool, he's slippery even.

" Paul, Riley and I had a nice weekend. Yesterday we went up to Bellevue to see Corey and Dan's new place. It is a big condo in the Renton Highlands. Her parents were over this way so we all went down to the Bellevue Arts and Crafts fair.   While there I completely mastered the art of breastfeeding Riley while walking with her in the sling. I love it! I don't even think anyone really knew what I was doing. Corey's dad even asked if she was sleeping.  So cool! I do need a new sling though. I think I am going to make one myself.   Today we all went to church. It was our seminarian, Kahn's, last day. So we went downstairs for doughnuts after mass. Then we came home and Riley was asleep so we did some marathon cleaning.   Robbin stopped by to say hi and reminded me of the heart fabric that she made Riley's curtains out of. (she gave me the excess). So I made Riley some cute pants. They are a little big and long now but she has a lot of room to grow into them.

"My name is Jessica. I'm 21 years old and my boyfriend and I have just broken up after 2 years.

"Longtime close friend, brand-new bewilderment My friend is distractable. He thinks irrationally. And he barely listens anymore.  I feel as though I've become a pane of glass or a mirror to him. When we're in a car together, he drones on about things (tell me if this has happened to you) he's told me many times before. Occasionally, in the middle, there's an admission: ""I probly told you this before, but.."". However, the story always continues, even if I briefly recap the story for him. When it's obvious the information has been shared, the most pressing imperative seems to be on reiterating it. Perhaps I didn't give the desired response the first time. I get the feeling he just doesn't care whether I'd like to hear it. I also possess conversational preferences, and they never include hearing the same story twice. After countless reccurences of this scenario, it seems that my considerations aren't really valued or remembered. Mentally, he seems to be on a train and passengers (myself included) are always bustling through and, as such, might just seem replaceable.  There doesn't seem anymore to be a genuine interest in my take on things. Questions are rarely asked, and if they are, they're poised in such a way as to elicit some agreeable response. We've never had a problem with differing opinions, but lately there is a marked disinterest in mine. If I express perhaps a different perspective I might share on something, he's typically halfway through deconstructing it and preparing a rebuttal by the time I've reached the bulk of my first sentence. Lately, I make sure to be concise. 10-word sentences. Brief, clear declarations with stipulations kept to a minimum. I do this in a sincere effort to make sure at least some of my thoughts reach him via this channel called speech. I feel a little like a sidekick, implicitly expected to go along with whatever is said or suggested and quietly supporting. I have needs and I make sure they're met. I just make sure, now, that they're met completely before I go into a conversation or endeavor with him.  The attention span has completely plummeted. He and his phone might as well have fused into one entity. Often times, when we're driving somewhere, or at our shared place of work, he will open a conversation. What he desires to be communicated is seemingly achieved. I give plenty of time, listening quietly and waiting a few seconds before responding. When I respond, sometimes I'll be surprised that I've been able to speak for a couple of sentences without being interrupted. Then, I'll look up and almost invariably, he's on his phone texting, on social media, or looking at boobs. I fall silent and look at him, stopping my speech, and sometimes there's a feigned response that hazily resembles some degree of mental assimilation. Other times, my input is simply ignored. I feel often that I am relegated to silence by virtue of necessity. What is the point of talking or even attempting to share with someone if they feel their device is more important than you? When there is no device involved, the listening is of such low quality that I feel as though I'm viewed as a shadow, or some reflective panel that occasionally flashes some piece of light which sparks a brief reaction.  I use the word reaction explicitly to differentiate from response. Responding, to me, would be careful consideration of the texture of the exchange. What I see falls on a spectrum between bristling and hyperenthusiastic. Everything in the observable behavior appears to come from an emotionally fueled place. I long ago ceased trying to appeal to logic and reason, because there seems to be a fantasy aspect to his formulations about reality, business, and essentially learning in general. An obstinate and vigorous type of chauvinism appears when the discussion involves logically based and scientifically supported criterion as pillars of discussion. ""Have you ever thought that maybe our ideas about science are just implanted by society, and another race has fully influenced our evolution as human beings?"" (to imply that the scrutiny intrinsic to the scientific community's assimilation of data is too dismissive toward fringe and pseudoscientific contributions). ""Physics is just one way to understand reality; there are physics we aren't even aware of that we won't know about for hundreds of years"" (as a soft excuse or rationale to discredit or invalidate the advances in modern physics and thus not include them in discussion). ""Can you prove to me that 1 + 1 = 2?"" (in a maddening conversation I had with him whereupon he elected to discredit all mathematics by attempting to upend the premise that numbers can accurately represent ideas).  I love math and physics because it helps accurately explain the world I live in. I can't share any of that enthusiasm with him, though, because his defenses rise as he falls lure to the siren of unreasonably ambiguous premises of belief. I get it; it represents flexibility and fluidity. There's no pinning someone  down for their rationales or justifications if they honestly feel their ideas reside above the established and fair principles of unbiased scientific criticism. The implication seems to be that it's a lot more fun and even more reasonable to live in the dark, because anything a person makes up could be true, and the absence of scrutiny works synergistically to provide disincentives for the need for proof.  We have been friends since third grade. We're both in our thirties now. We've remained close and shared lots of valuable experiences. Emotionally, we're there for each other and that's always what we've been best at. But I feel this insistence on the employment of a deductive philosophy of thinking which ignores outside criteria in favor of ""empathetic"" consult has wedged a chasm between us. I can't really tell if it's me or him whom has done the most changing in the last few years, but rest assured, I am working at a 100% level of effort to rectify what issues there are and reforge our understandings.  A personal aside:  Three years ago, I experienced a rather significant mental shift. I began to make efforts to look at the world more objectively, understanding better how I was not the focal point of existence. I took myself down a few notches, and in doing so, became irrevocably drawn to learning about the finer workings of the world in which I lived.  During this time, I had the pleasure of working with a young man seven years my junior with whom I could seemingly achieve no middle ground. Even just a casual extended conversation seemed unbearable. We came from different places and really just resigned ourselves to tolerating one another. For a long while, I just couldn't put my finger on what bugged me about the guy. Then, about six months in, it hit me: I was unable to reasonably share anything I had learned, without it being scrutinized needlessly by way of the contrast of his own biased interpretations. The scrutiny itself didn't bother me; it was the nature of the uncredentialed and entitled rebuttals. They had little basis in scientific sourcing and did not stand stand up well to criticism. The young man's ideas about the world were essentially all based on his own experience, and there appeared to be no real desire in him to contrast those findings with a collective reality outside of his own.  I eventually came to realize I didn't like the kid because he reminded me of me.  From that point on, I vowed to observe my thought processes more closely. The last thing I wanted was to waste someone's time unwittingly by spewing nonsensical garbage of which I had no demonstrable proof or understanding. I read about using proper reasoning and recognizing logical fallacies. I worked to become more mindful toward my own irrational inclinations. It became tantamount to recognize the ignorances and defenses to which I'd become accustomed to clinging, and replace them with the collective wisdom provided by my new best friends: logical and rational thought. As I was doing my best to employ these utilities, I figured I could scarce be assumed a fool and reasonably sort out those ideas which did not hold up to proper scrutiny.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this new method of articulating reality didn't win me many friends. The good ones I've retained, and those who didn't share this unearthed enthusiasm for inductive reasoning were left behind. This friendship I share with this person seems like a relic of the past me. I don't believe he's shared the same monumental changes in mental processing. He's always had a certain flair for exaggeration and fantasy, and until recently, I just accepted it as face value and dealt with the occasional misunderstandings as I'm sure he had with me. Now, however, the implications seem more pronounced. He's running a business and is constantly distracted. The time we share is often saturated by ramblings of fanatical pseudoscience or mysticism which are  impossibly asserted and employ mind-numbingly irrational justifications. The only discipline seems to be that of a zealous allegiance to the fortification of the shared psychological concoctions of the hopefully ignorant. There is little point in rebuttal anymore because, deductively, the answer has already been solved for. And rest assured, 1 + 1 = 2 was not used in this equation.  If indeed there is a future for this friendship, at least on my half, it involves intensely disciplined patience. I feel sometimes like a social worker, intently listening and softly steering the delinquent in a healthier direction. I meditate and identify as Buddhist. I consider myself to be a spiritual person, and I understand that my interpretation of reality is uniquely pixelated in ways that differ from those of others. I work to cultivate higher compassion and practice patience and kindness when I feel a bristling within myself or witness a bristling in others. As such, I feel that just living my values and being a good listener might be the way through this. I can't help but feeling, though, that this is the beginning of a fork in the road which leads to an increasingly fainter sense of collective recognition.",0,longtime close friend brandnew

"I had a date on Saturday. It went great unfortunately. I have a friend that I'll call H. I've known her for 2+ years now and I really like her as a person. I recently discovered that she was interested in dating me, which boosted my self confidence so much (because who would be into someone like me). Well a week ago I worked up the courage to ask her out on a date, and this Saturday we went on one. It was great. We went to a small local coffee shop and sat there and just talked for almost 3 hours. It was seriously such a good time. On the way out I asked if she'd like to do it again and she said yes. Awesome!   Later that night I get a text... she doesn't think it will work out in the long run. I ask her why and she says we both have very different plans with our future, she's still getting over another break up, etc... Well that sucks, but I understand.    I was texting H about it a bit more tonight and this is what I get in reply to how I feel about the whole situation- ""i feel like there were so many expectations from others that it was made into something i thought i wanted, but then i realized it wasn’t.""

My parents will have some cash and also have monthly income, but my brother appears to be very depressed, may also have some untreated medical issues, and is a sober alcoholic who may be abusing prescription drugs (not pain pills, but Xanax &amp; Ativan? Not sure). He seems to sleep all day and rarely goes to his job, which is doing over other people's houses as a contractor. He owns his own truck and tools. My parents are worried they'll ""lose"" him when they move if he doesn't move with them, but nobody knows what to do or what his real problem(s) are.  Is it a stupid idea for us to just have everyone live in our building and subsidize my brother's ""rent"" by having him pay some nominal amount subject to regular psychiatry and/or other requirements? Has anyone done this? Is there another sub that is better for these types of questions? I don't know if anyone knows what to do anymore. My mom enables him but is finally making an appointment for him to see an internist, though he is very manipulative and secretive so I don't know what to do or if anything else can be done and I am somewhat concerned he will manipulate the internist--he's very deceptive.

" Blog. Short for we B LOG ? Or just another stupid semi-acronym invented for the 21st C.? Supposedly, these 'blogs' are the new 'journalism' or the new 'voice of a generation'. Just like the printing press in 1450, the telephone circa 18something (Google Telephone History, you'll see), and cable TV in the early 70's.  Whatever.  I'm not sure if this thing will come to any valuable/relevant end, but I like to ramble in print, and being too lazy to keep a journal, this is perfect. Also, hopefully, this blog will allow me to argue with people. I love to argue, and if a good debate is presented, then I may take the bate.  I may just use this to post my drunken ramblings, but I may also use this blog for evil. There are folks out there that need to be taken down a notch.  Anyway, for tonight,  Peace.

Then my grandmother woke me up for a breakfast that everyone argued over, even with a goddamn three year old. Nothing changed, I just had a bullshit dream that’ll never really happen.

" I’d like to share a quote I particularly like:   	“We find comfort among those who agree with us - growth among those who don’t.” 									- Frank A. Clark  How are we ever suppose to grow and learn if we are constantly surrounded by people who agree with us?  When you sit and discuss a topic with someone else who has an opposing view you will learn more from that one person than if you sat and discussed that same topic with 10 other people who believe what you do.  Although, I have found some very interesting conversations start up between people with the same views who are just pondering other possibilities.  I have a friend who is interested in the building sciences like I am, the two of us can get together and just bounce back ideas about what if this were to happen or if this one thing changed wouldn’t that make a huge difference to the houses and buildings going up right now?  It’s really cool to have someone on the same wavelength as you.  But, as far as growth goes, I feel I learn more by talking to someone about a topic that we are opposed on rather than have the same feelings.  When I come across a good conversation like this I’ll try to remember to share it.

I can't make it better I'm tired of nearly every aspect of my life. Changing it for the better would require money.  To get money you have to work.  Work is boring and tedious and makes me miserable. That goes for any job I could realistically obtain. I can't do more than part time.  I'll never have the kind of money it would take to change my life in ways that might make me happier. There is no point to life so why suffer through the misery and hardship? I want to die but I can't kill myself. I'll never have the nerve.

" I guess I should start out by telling a little about myself ...  I'm 16 years old, and I live in south florida.   I tend to  live  at the beach. I just don't understand how you can be so blessed as to be able to live on the ocean and not take advantage of it ..  I do things a typical 16 year old does, I guess. I love dancing, drinking, surfing, shopping, tanning, music, movies, and just hanging out. Okay, so I'm from boca raton, and as many of you  may  have heard, girls there tend to be shallow bitches .. I happen to be neither, unless you  really  piss me off ;)  Things that I live for are sunsets, sunrises, first kisses, hockey games..& players*:P, smoothies, FSU football, chocolate covered strawberries, dancing the night away, and gazing at the stars.  I want to be famous. I'm not really sure how I'm going to go about doing this, but hey, if it happens, I'll be thrilled.  I don't take things for granted. I live life day by day, and I try not to worry about what's gonna happen tomorrow. Life is short. I believe in forgiving someone who's hurt you, even if they don't deserve it. Don't judge a book by it's cover. Spend as much time with your family as you can, especially your grandparents. You can learn more than you've ever imagined.  I've never  really  been  in  love, romantically that is. I've loved a lot, but I'm scared. Scared of being hurt, scared of loving someone so much as to not be able to live without them. Lately, I've been finding out that trying so hard  not  to love, hurts just as much.  With one look at me, you'd probably label me as a typical ""dumb"" blonde bimbo. Hopefully, if you really take the time to know me, you'll realize that, even though I do have my ditzy moments, I'm not at all like my exterior shows.  I'm a sexual person. If you don't like it, then don't say anything to me. I'm not at all slutty, but I'm in touch with my sexuality. I believe that as long as you're comfortable with your body and who you are, then that's a perfectly fine thing to be.  I'm probably one of the  most  open people you'll ever meet. So, looking at me, you might not think so, but I am. I've been through a lot, and you'll find all of it out eventually.  Anyways, I guess that's me in a nutshell. I guess I'll be writing a lot more later, so hope to hear from all of you .. peace xo ",0,guess start telling little year old live south florida tend live beach just not understand blessed able live ocean not advantage thing typical year old doe guess love dancing drinking surfing shopping tanning music movie just hanging out okay boca raton heard girl tend shallow bitch happen neither unless really piss thing live sunset sunrise kiss hockey game player smoothy fsu football chocolate covered strawberry dancing night away gazing star want famous not really sure going doing this hey happens thrilled not thing granted live life day day try not worry gonna happen tomorrow life short believe forgiving hurt you not deserve it not judge book cover spend time family can especially grandparent learn imagined really love romantically is loved lot scared scared hurt scared loving not able live them lately finding trying hard not love hurt just much look me probably label typical dumb blonde bimbo hopefully really time know me realize that ditzy moment not like exterior show sexual person not like it not say me not slutty touch sexuality believe long comfortable body are perfectly fine thing be probably open people meet so looking me not think so am lot eventually anyways guess nutshell guess writing lot later hope hear peace xo

"I was rejected &amp; I feel great Last night I asked a close friend of mine on a date and was rejected, but strangely enough I don't feel dejected but rather proud and accomplished.  To provide some background, I'll be turning 20 on the 15th, and last year, just 4 days after my 19th birthday, I was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder. This disorder is characterized by long lasting, essentially uninterrupted periods of depression lasting AT LEAST 2 years, and in many cases, such as with myself, far longer. To provide a rough estimate, I have been depressed somewhere around a total of 13 years of my life.  The depression has had a serious negative affect on my love life, at times making me cold and even cruel. The most egregious example of this was when, after having dated this girl for a few months, I stopped talking to her almost entirely and started flirting with other girls. Eventually she had to get her friend to break up with me on her behalf because I was refusing to talk to her. At the time, because of the depression, I thought little of myself, seeing myself as a worthless scumbag, and so I started acting like one. I was also afraid to open up to some else, so instead I became emotionally cold and avoidant. I hated this behavior in myself, and held a deep guilt for how I had treated women I had been with, so about 5 years ago I stopped dating entirely.  Despite being rejected, having finally had the confidence and self respect to ask out a woman and accept the no graciously is a major growth in my self esteem and wellbeing, so having done so I feel a great sense of accomplishment. This has really helped boost my self esteem and confidence, even though I was rejected.  There's no real point to this story, but I just wanted to get this out there, because I'm really proud of the progress I've made so far.",1,rejected amp feel great night asked close friend date rejected strangely not feel dejected proud accomplished provide background turning th year just day th birthday diagnosed persistent depressive disorder disorder characterized long lasting essentially uninterrupted period depression lasting year case myself far longer provide rough estimate depressed total year life depression negative affect love life time making cold cruel egregious example when having dated girl month stopped talking entirely started flirting girl eventually friend break behalf refusing talk her time depression thought little myself seeing worthless scumbag started acting like one afraid open else instead emotionally cold avoidant hated behavior myself held deep guilt treated woman with year ago stopped dating entirely despite rejected having finally confidence self respect ask woman accept graciously major growth self esteem wellbeing having feel great sense accomplishment really helped boost self esteem confidence rejected real point story just wanted there really proud progress far
"19 M here...family dispute between uncle's n dad. PLEASE ADVICE hi..i am 19 yrs old and currently in college.   please bear my poor English.  so i know the title is kinda vague and idk i felt i wld get some views n advices here. so  it all  strtd from childhood. My uncle  was jealous of dad in evrythng. Dad was adored by all d siblings he wasnt, coz he was grandmas eye n youngest. Actually grandma spoild him...kinda the pampered kid who is arrogant. He had his ways in evrythng.  Ok den marriage,  n kids. not bragging but i must say this...my siblings kinda ""got our shit together"" den his kids..in terms of academic performance or like social life in general...so maybe yeah that added  Again highr level of jealousy.  He evn said i got 1st rank in my high school  (which i did..nerdy days)coz its a ""rotten school"". i am in another city too now, not homwtown. Den my uncle sent his kids to outside cities too , but all faild wid single digits. Shame added to jealousy probably . after some time he bought  Hyundai i10 car. after some time Dad bought i20 too...actually the thing is it was the time when we were kinda grown up too  and a car was necessary plus  i hv four siblings so i20...mayb my uncle thought it was kinda a competition..childish i know.   Bam! N then came  d issue of d ""way"".  see my dad , uncle,  and dads elder brother , they all lived together before(joint fam)....Wen they  seperatd land, they decided de sud leav 10 feet land for vehicle...lemme explain that bit. its like imaging three houses next to next and we need to leave path to the right so that we cn park beside respective house...the main entry being point being our uncle's because his house is first, middle dad then dads elder bro.  my dads elder bro did(left 10feet to the side then constructed new house), dad did, he dint.  N wen dad told, he said ""u dnt evn hav a car nw(then ). I will gv way wen u buy."" N my grandparents let him hav his way. Actually its all der fault. they never take d authority.  N wen we bougt the car, he refusd straight. We dint hav place to keep our new car. We kept in a locality friend' house. Such emberasment. N uncle dint gv ""way"" all d tym. Dad didnt try to make an issue coz our grandparents wer der n he thought to make them approach n deal first.. they didnt.  They  wer too spineless. Its der land, de r parents de but  dint hav d guts to tell my uncle ...hey "" you r wrng"".  Dats why i hate dem when de dramatise to love dad when they  need money. N things remaind same.  Den grandpa was sick. then Dunno smthng hapnd, dads elder bro and another close relative were angry at my uncle for an issue. So they went to his house to talk. N he opend d door n said m busy go away and other rude things.  she (relative ) slappd him. He hit her n broke her head.

"How do I deal with feeling worthless? I’ve had a bad day and this is on top of just a long few years of my life where I can’t remember the last time I’ve truly been happy. I have a few friends but the more my life has gone on, the more I’ve realized certain dislikings i have towards them. I want to meet new people and do new things, something that my friends aren’t interested in or don’t have time for. I’m as bad as you could imagine when it comes to making new friends because I can be really socially awkward and I’m convinced that few other people share specific interests that I would look for in friends or a girlfriend. I have few (if any) aspirations in life and I just feel like I’m drifting through life without any idea what I want. I don’t feel like I’ve accomplished much in my life, I’m in college but I’ve never held a job before and I’m hardly passionate enough about a career to really be interested to want to pursue it.

"When people ask you what you did for the weekend, or for your birthday, etc. I have no idea how to respond. My emotions have become so numb  that I can't feel anything so therefore I cannot enjoy anything I used to like doing. I literally just go to work everyday for 8 hours, come home and browse the news and reddit and listen to music, trying to entertain myself but never really succeeding. There's nothing I can enjoy. So when someone asks me what I did I just say some crap like I just relaxed at home or something, I don't know what else to say.  It's the worst part about depression for me. Not being able to enjoy anything. I don't even look forward to coming home from work because it's not like I have anything to enjoy at home. It's all the same dullness. I'd probably work 12-14 hours a day seven days a week if I could because it wouldn't bother me at all, I'm not missing out on anything.

"Hello. I am a 40 year-old woman, and I'm feeling quite lost right now. I've always been sort of depressed, but have never been given a formal diagnosis. That may change tomorrow. I have an appointment with a shrink. My psychiatrist put me on Prozac 3 years ago. I was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 34, and needed some help getting past that. I am adopted (a biggie for relationship issues), was married at the age of 18, had 3 kids by the time I was 40, and I'm having a hard time transitioning to my new stage in life (sort of empty nest syndrome, I guess) I should be thrilled with my life. I make oodles of money, my kids are all fairly successful & just about on their own, but I'm miserable. My husband and I are in a sort of ""friendship"" relationship, I could care less if he stays or goes. I started having panic attacks after my 40th birthday few weeks ago; I actually thought I was having a heart attack. So now, I'm on 30 mg Prozac & .05 Klonadine (1/2 pill at a time) 3 times a day. I can't quit crying. So... how long does a psychology test take. How long will it take for them to diagnose me with something? These drugs aren't doing a whole lot.

"My purpose for posting this is that I'm at a dead end and don't know where else to turn. I'm 39 and I'm sure have been suffering from depression most my whole life. My life has been one failure after another, in relationships, jobs, and anything else. I had been on antidepressants for about 10 years and then stopped after I got arrested for a DUI and felony hit and run. The man who was injured received a cut on his face after chasing after me when I split the scene, that was the whole extent of his injuries. After the arrest I was feeling so bad it made no difference whether I took them or not. The charges were dropped but I had to wait day after day for a year or more just waiting for them to recharge me, which my attorney was sure they were going to do. That was 2 years ago and I think the experience did some very serious and real damage to me. I just lost my job in my probationary period of 2 months. I have worked so hard to create some kind of financial security for myself (BA in Psychology, technical degree in computers, numerous computer certifications) but where ever I go I don't fit in to the group and find myself alienated and let go. Some many failed romantic relationships, never having friends, and what family members I have are abusive and are incapable of providing healthy support. Most nights I calm myself enough to fall asleep by fantasizing about killing myself and the relief that was provide. I feel like a freak physically. I shortened my fingers on my right hand by 1/2 inch and my hand is deformed because I hit the wall in my apartment one night about 4 years ago after I was let go from a job and my girlfriend broke up with me at the same time.  Of course what I have stated so far isn't close to all that is weighing on me.  Now I am just so tired and hopeless I don't know how to get the energy to try again. Any encouragement or wisdom the read / you can provide is very much appreciated. If you need to something that is hurtful please don't respond to this.

" Well, I bought my plane ticket back to Flint yesterday. It's going to be nice to see my family again. Of course, as soon as I had my ticket I talked to my sister and learned that home sweet home has become more disturbing than ever. It's hard for Flint to shock me--we're talking about a city that considered selling the trees in its parks for lumber, but I'm actually starting to get scared. A friend's cousin was beaten to death in his car in front of his eight-year-old son. One of the editors at the magazine my sister writes her vegan cooking column for was beaten to near-death and left in the street. Oh, and two women were found dead, one downtown and the other near Mott Park. Mott Park for God's sake! My favorite neighborhood in Flint. Where I always wanted to live. Where I went to school. Where my sister and brother-in-law just bought a house. I always look forward to going home, but this time I'm getting an ominous, horror-movie feeling. I'm learning to appreciate Mankato more and more. I think I'll just stay in Flint long enough to see  Hamlet  (which I'm sure will be excellent) and then I'll head to the Saint Clair River Delta, relax on the island and watch the freighters float by.

"I'm brand-new here at these forums. I've come to you all to seek guidance/wisdom from any of you who has suffered or is currently suffering from depression. Within the past 3 years I have struggled on and off with this disease. For the most part I've had it under control, until relatively recently. About four months ago I was drastically descending downwards mental health wise. The result of this declination helped obstruct all aspects of my social life, causing an abrupt, painful end to many friendships I endeared. Also my negative behavior started to poison. The equilibrium that my family and I shared. The result of all this lead not only to my choice of isolation , but even if I chose not to isolate myself, I still had damaged relationships so much, that any attempts to make amends, and or repair former friendships, were futile. I basically pushed and alienated myself from everything I held dearest. Anyways, one day I just snapped; my ability to process information, perform simple math equations, remember things I had JUST thought of seconds before, concentrate, quick wit, and confident decision making had all been impaired immensely. Previously, before all of this, I was an ""A"" Honor Role student and had no difficulty functioning efficiently in my ""AP"" classes, but now I can barely sustain a low ""B"" average. Has anyone experienced this lack of cognition? If so, do you know if it will go away?

" Hello friends, foes, and faggamuffins! Welcome to El Blog. I bet you're wondering how this blog came to be. What is its innate purpose? Is the world ready for it? Where can I get a good ham sandwhich at 2am?   The truth is this. Last night, I was walking my scottydog, Monty, with x-large inside-out baggie ready in hand and a mountain of frustration building. It always takes Monty at least 20 mintues to find the perfect patch of grass to excrete his waste matter upon. This is because he knows the very second that last tappering chunk hits the ground he will be whiplashed across the lawn back up into the apartment (well, ok, a slight pause as my bagged hand scoops up his hot, steaming pile). Anyway, last night, he was really taking his time. It had been 35 minutes and we had yet to find the night's sanctuary of defecation. Just as I was about to give up all hope and line the livingroom with newspaper and Bush campaign posters, he popped a squat. It was  THEN!  when I bent over to collect the night's batch that it  hit me . Yes, that one delayed missle-launched chunk,   but also   an idea!  Create my very own Blog!  And so here it is. As for the other questions, folks, I have no answers. I just ask them.

"I'm a traitor. I went to check out the other room without anyone knowing that it was me, just to see who was in there. While I saw someone stabbing me in the back, someone else pm'd me. Having a go, blah blah, how I shouldn't discriminate against people and make them leave THIS room.  I was thinking ""wtf?"" I never made people leave this room. All my problem people are on ignore and are left there *as it is in the rules*  So anyway, I just turns out that someone let this person know that I was a host from this forum masquerading, as if to get information from these people that have ""abandoned"" this chat. I Don't care about the other chat, other people shouldn't. You guys are welcome to wherever you want to go. You are banned for putting the link in the room and whispering it to people, which is AGAINST the rules. I know that the person that pm'd me feels bad, It ISN'T my fault. I didn't yell at her for making the mistake, I was understanding. I've made that mistake, I feel bad for it when I do. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO MESS UP.  So why people must bring stuff from THAT room into THIS room and make me so frigging angry again that I have to leave is beyond me. Why, if there are two separate rooms, can't stuff from the rooms STAY IN THAT ROOM?!?! It's so much easier. People won't get confused that way.  At this point I would just like to reiterate that I have no problems whatsoever with any of the people that go to either room. Anyone I can't handle talking to, I don't talk to. I just take objection to being asked about it here, where I come to forget about my problems, not be reminded of them.  And now, I've totally lost the thread of where I was going with this post, thanks to a whole bunch of reasons, and I'm getting too stressed to type, and all that's just irritated me further.

"A friend cut me off So recently a friend of mine cut me off and I’m not really sure why. I guess to understand my concern it would be best to get the whole story.  I had first met her earlier this school year. Our desks were right next to each other in math class. Back then, she was very talkative, sociable, optimistic, and energetic around me. I’m not always the most talkative type but that didn’t seem to bother her at all. She always shouted for my attention to say hi to me when passed each other in the halls. She asked for my number, introduced me to a few of her friends, and even invited me over to her house for lunch during one of our off periods. We texted a couple times though I will admit each time I kept feeling like I was annoying her.  Eventually, she had invited me to come with her boyfriend and group of friends to hang out at the mall over Christmas vacation. I was so excited. However, when the day finally came, I couldn’t help but feel like a third wheel. She was much more focused on her boyfriend than she was on anyone else and the only time she noticed me was when I had wandered off without telling any of them. That wasn’t cool of me, I admit, but I just didn’t feel needed or even wanted there at times. Later that night though, I texted her and apologized for not being that social but she it was all fine.  But I still couldn’t shake the feeling that she was upset with me. When we came back from vacation, my suspicions grew. She was a lot more quiet and distant from me and was usually on her phone with her headphones in whenever I was around. It was around this time that I started to become a lot more needy. She still responded to my texts and told me that the reason she was so quiet was because she had a headache. But I couldn’t help but notice that she was still pretty social around her other friends. At one point when we were walking in the halls, she had her headphones in and didn’t say a word to me but the minute she saw one of her other friends, she took her headphones out and screamed for his attention. All while I was standing right next to her.  It was a week before winter vacation when we got into an argument. You see, she was aware of my depression and offered her assistance in helping me deal with it. However, in our argument, she expressed her displeasure with how she felt she was putting in all the effort into dealing with my problems. I tried apologizing to her, probably getting a bit too dramatic about it, but she just expressed her annoyance at how I constantly needed her assurance and that if I don’t try to change myself, she won’t be my friend anymore. Eventually, I apologized for my part in the argument and how I didn’t make her help feel appreciated, but I also explained to her that I was doing something about my depression. I see a psychiatrist and take antidepressants every night. Still, she insisted that I needed to change. But by this point, whenever I spoke to her in person, she always seemed disinterested and kind of annoyed. When I asked her if she had a problem with me, she would always say that she was either busy or wasn’t in the mood for it. Eventually, she responded that she needed space for the whole vacation, so I didn’t text her at all. But when the vacation was over, I tried to text if everything was fine now only to discover that she had blocked my number. Now, she doesn’t even acknowledge my presence anymore and almost seems to actively avoid me.  I apologize if this is really long. I just wanted to be as detailed as possible. At this point, I just feel at a loss and confused about what happened. I’m not sure if I did something wrong or if she was ever my friend at all. I mean, our friendship felt genuine those first months before Christmas. But now I just don’t know what to think or do.

JB and I went to a farmer's market, went swimming then fell asleep on the grass in the shade. The relaxation was much needed and I feel soo great. Oh, we went shopping on Friday and I spent way too much money. I got some supper cute heels though. I've always been into girlie things. I love pink but this season is making it sooo much easier to be into pink. I love it. I bought little pink heels with wonderful tiny black bows on the side. I also bought a bunch of ""work"" clothes.

"Am I in a bad friendship? I have this friend and he's actually really fun and quite an extrovert. He's cheerful most of the time. But the thing is he has anger issues and he gets pissed off at people and stuff easily including me. Whenever i play games like league of legends with him he gets so mad at me for stuff that i didn't even do and even at one point filed a complaint and wrote stuff that was completely false about me. And I used to ask him questions sometimes via text and he'd always respond but then he'd say ""you could've at least said hi"". So one time i just said a simple hi to him and you know what? he said ""I'm really not in the mood for a pointless hi"" and he seemed really moody to me especially for some reason and then he typed something ""you know i really dont know why you bother..."" i couldnt read the rest because he deleted it. But whats weird is he still wants to play league with me and stuff which i find stupid because i know hes just gonna get angry at me again and only me. he never gets angry at anyone else he plays with in that game and it makes me feel sick. So i just stopped messaging him in general. and one time he said ""you know i dont know why im so aggressive to you so lets just forget that happened"" and i didnt say much and he said ""i know you dont have much to say and i dont care so lets just forget"". He didnt even say sorry for being so mean to me. To me it just looked like someone that was trying to clean up the pile of junk he left so he doesnt need to think of it later. It makes me feel so sick to think of. And sometimes he calls me a bitch and a hoe. Like really? Why would you call your friend that? I never called him anything like that. One time he was trying to talk to me and a bunch of other people were talking over him so I couldn't hear him. Then he said ""yo bitch"". I really wanted to punch him in the face that was really hurtful like I have a name cant you at least say my dam name? Sometimes I just hate him so much and its sad because hes a fun person but he just gets stupidly pissed off and says whatever he wants without thinking how hurtful or rude it is.",0,bad friendship friend actually really fun quite extrovert cheerful time thing anger issue get pissed people stuff easily including me play game like league legend get mad stuff did not point filed complaint wrote stuff completely false me used ask question text respond say you said hi time just said simple hi know what said i really not mood pointless hi really moody especially reason typed you know really dont know bother read rest deleted it whats weird want play league stuff stupid know he just gonna angry me get angry play game make feel sick just stopped messaging general time said you know dont know im aggressive let just forget happened didnt say said i know dont say dont care let just forget didnt say sorry mean me just looked like trying clean pile junk left doesnt need think later make feel sick think of call bitch hoe like really friend that called like that time trying talk bunch people talking not hear him said yo bitch really wanted punch face really hurtful like say dam name just hate sad he fun person just get stupidly pissed say want thinking hurtful rude is

"My brother has depression and I need help I’ll start off by saying I’m not sure if this is the right place to say this and if it isn’t, I’d love if you could point me in the right direction. My brother has a multitude of things such as depression, anxiety and anger issues. Recently he has been going to IOP (can’t exactly remember the name, but it’s a step below inpatient care) at a facility and he has shown some progress. I feel like he’s more in touch with how he feels and is working on coping mechanisms better. However he did not go to his session today and that caused problems. He got his check from work today and it would not get deposited, and that set him off into a fit. He started breaking things and getting in both mine and my parents faces, cussing and attacking us. We had a conversation after and he said he tells himself the thing we tell him, such as how he needs to be more rational and more committed to getting better. He also eats unhealthy and is overweight, and I’ve attempted to help him get healthier about a month ago, but he stopped listening to me about. I love and care for him deeply but our family is at our wits end with what to do. I would want to leave him be and let him sort his issues out without us harassing him about it but when he gets violent and angry around the house we can’t sit idly. I’m not sure what the next step is but I’d love to hear advice from anyone. Thanks for listening.

After coming home my madre informed me that Orlando would not be coming home this weekend because he had something to do in Bristol.  I do understand that this is a new life both exciting and adventurous, but I also understand the pain I experienced when realizing I would not see him for another week.  I knew this wouldn't be easy, it just sucks.  There are beautiful, sophisticated girls there and I am some simpleton with which there lies no mystery or intrigue.  I am old, boring and worn out.

"I [22/m] and a friend of mine [20/m] had a dispute which questions our friendship. TL;DR,  OP misread the situation by telling a joke to which his drunk friend took offence and revealed to OP's other friends OPs 3-year buried drug habit. OPs friends now know things OP originally wanted to be left in the past.     *********   My friend (let's call him T, for now) and I had a dispute over what we classify as exposing each other. T was very drunk and gave some information I kept very personal out to my other friends and myself who were sober at the time. He mentioned the last time I got high, but he did mention how long ago. This is important because Ive had an on and off history of depression which I've been struggling with years, and I previously I used to combat it by developing a drug habit. I've been working hard to be clean for 3 years, and I've kept all this under the rug because I didn't wish to be labelled by my friends as irresponsible, or be denied respect as their friend. I buried my past and drug habits for good,  doing so brought me great happiness because this was the first thing I felt I like I myself was worth something and it let me come out of depression for a long time. He did all this because I had made a joke in this particular conversation, to which he reacted negatively, and said I ruined his reputation though my joke was not intentional to do so. Because of this, people I trust  now are asking me if I do drugs or partake in self harm because of what he said about me. Some people I'm friends with are asking me if I need counselling though I'm clean. I'm not sure if I can forgive him and it's made me feel less than a person, which is something I haven't felt in 3 years. I feel worthless again and I'm not quite sure I can mend all my friendships that probably think down upon lowest point in life. Should I cut ties with T? What should I do if now my other friends  might not see me the same way anymore?",0,m friend m dispute question friendship tlr op misread situation telling joke drunk friend took offence revealed op friend ops year buried drug habit ops friend know thing op originally wanted left past friend let t now dispute classify exposing other t drunk gave information kept personal friend sober time mentioned time got high did mention long ago important ive history depression struggling year previously used combat developing drug habit working hard clean year kept rug did not wish labelled friend irresponsible denied respect friend buried past drug habit good doing brought great happiness thing felt like worth let come depression long time did joke particular conversation reacted negatively said ruined reputation joke not intentional so this people trust asking drug partake self harm said me people friend asking need counselling clean not sure forgive feel person not felt year feel worthless not quite sure mend friendship probably think lowest point life cut tie t friend not way anymore

"Law of Attraction is bullshit. Also hard work doesn't pay off. Everything in life is based on chance and luck only.   Our society preaches the fiction of hard work paying off because we need most expandable people to work hard, so that the rest can just chill and live off their backs.  Also every fucking motivational coach and self-help guide is a fucking scam. Focusing your goals, working hard and putting effort in to achieve them? Yeah, tell that to people with terminal diseases or people living in poverty without the chance to ever get better, people dying of famine or living in war zones.

"I will be on the road in less than 72 hours. The last month has taken a serious toll on me physically, cognitively, emotionally, and spiritually. Things have suddenly gotten so crazy. Nothing looks even remotely familiar to me (Aggers, 2002). I have held My Sweetie with tears in my eyes, hoping her to buoy my hope for the future. I have been overwhelmed by the enormity of change and possibility, fallen to my knees, bowed my head beneath our roof, and prayed in earnest that it will not be the last. I have wrestled with the stranglehold of others' denial, silently observing time crush their last defense as the flurry of last-minute demands, requests, and desires are left unfulfilled. I have ended my beloved employment, said goodbye to supervisors and peers, returned keys, cleaned out my desk, and stood at the door of my empty office with the first true inkling of the magnitude of what has become the most difficult life transition I have yet faced.",1,road hour month taken toll physically cognitively emotionally spiritually thing suddenly gotten crazy look remotely familiar aggers held sweetie tear eye hoping buoy hope future overwhelmed enormity change possibility fallen knee bowed head beneath roof prayed earnest not last wrestled stranglehold others denial silently observing time crush defense flurry lastminute demand request desire left unfulfilled ended beloved employment said goodbye supervisor peer returned key cleaned desk stood door office true inkling magnitude difficult life transition faced
"I've always resented my mom for being emotionally abusive growing up and blamed her for my depression. But I just told her I'm depressed and she responded in the most perfect way. I feel really weird. I'm an adult now (24) and have had crippling depression since childhood. Growing up, I never had emotional support or love. I was called names and my mom took out her relationship/life issues on me. I was distant from both my parents. I've hugged my mom only once in my life. This is just one issue out of many that led to me developing a fragile self esteem and crippling depression. Over the years, with distance, we started to talk- like once a month or so. The more educated I became, the more I came to understand why she acted the way she did (although I still harbor much resentment) I'm going through a depressive episode just now. I feel so alone and I texted her out of desperation. I told her I felt alone and depressed and couldn't get out of bed to study. Instead of judging me or saying something mean....she just listened to everything and all of my symptoms. She said that she felt so sorry for me and she wished she could help me. And she told me to never feel alone because she loves me and I'm very important to her. She asked if she could do anything to help me...and I realized, yeah, if we could call each other every morning, I could have someone to talk to and tell her about my daily goals. Then I could feel more motivated to get out of bed and feel less alone that day. I just feel weird, because I don't have a relationship with her. I'm scared it's going to be awkward, but I'm desperate for any support I can get right now. I also still resent her, but at the same time understand. I don't know. It's just weird.  But, I'm happy she acted this way, for sure.     Edit: I also don't mean to brag or anything like that.

"How can I get my finances back to a point where I can go to school or to a point where I don’t hate my life? I guess some backstory. I’m 19 about to be 20 in September.   When I was in spring of 11th grade my mom got sick (Lupus or something, honestly she might be faking it but that’s a whole different post.)   Anyway she went to the hospital and was there for about a month. I ended up skipping a lot of school to be able to care for and do all the general house duties for my younger brothers. (11yrs old and 1yr old at the time.). Things progress my mom misses a lot of work we end up moving with my grandma.   Now here’s where shit really hits the fan. So tensions build between my grandma and my mom because of my moms suspected prescription opiate and Benzo abuse. Anyhow, dfchs gets involved (not related to the drugs but that didn’t help) about 4 months before I go to college and my moms health deteriorates seemingly out of nowhere. So freshman and sophomore year I’m juggling trying to work to support myself, school, and helping my grandma take care of my brothers. I thought I could handle it, I couldn’t.  Of course my schoolwork suffered and my gpa dropped below Hope eligibility.   So I tried to find a full time job, and I did. Then got laid off not too soon after due to “budget cuts.” My first time experiencing adulthood.  Shortly after my car died and my depression got to a dark place.   What followed is 3months of applying to anything I could reasonably walk to (I was trying to search within 5miles) because transportation in the part of Georgia I was in was a huge deal and I could not get around.    No jobs responded. Including the Walmart a mile away with a fucking hiring sign out front that I repeatedly went in to try and talk and build rapport with the managers.   During these 3 months I took out 3 credit cards and ended up maxing them out. I needed food and other essentials that I simply had no money for.   The depression kinda spiraled out of control.  I had a plan in place to hang myself but my friends at the time took the rope I was going to use and I was too broke to buy another.   My dad who has been in and out of my life. Mostly out prior to this. Invited me out to come stay with him and his family in LA while I tried to get myself together.  I’m working hard, I found a job here. Retail but it’s a job. I’m waking up early, I’m doing noFap and I’m working out 3x a week to try to keep my depression in check.   But despite all that, I want to kill die still.  I don’t see a future where I’m able to continue school. Dfchs told me they couldn’t help pay for college because “I wasn’t in for long enough before beginning college” but they had no fucking problem coming to my dorm and asking me questions and causing stress once a week.   I feel like I’m barely supporting myself, and honestly I haven’t talked to my brothers since the youngest ones birthday (April 15th). Because I feel like I failed them. I haven’t talked to my grandma either because I feel like a disappointment.  And my mom keeps calling me every other month telling me she’s gonna kill herself because she feels like nobody loves her. Even through I bent over fucking backwards trying to help her by bringing my brothers to see her and making sure they could talk.   (My grandma and the rest of my moms family won’t talk to her because she’s cursed all of them out horribly when they tried to be there for her)  ",1,finance point school point not hate life guess backstory september spring th grade mom got sick lupus something honestly faking different post went hospital month ended skipping lot school able care general house duty younger brother yr old yr old time thing progress mom miss lot work end moving grandma shit really hit fan tension build grandma mom mom suspected prescription opiate benzo abuse anyhow dfchs get involved not related drug did not help month college mom health deteriorates seemingly nowhere freshman sophomore year juggling trying work support myself school helping grandma care brother thought handle it not course schoolwork suffered gpa dropped hope eligibility tried time job did got laid not soon budget cut time experiencing adulthood shortly car died depression got dark place followed month applying reasonably walk i trying search mile transportation georgia huge deal not around job responded including walmart mile away fucking hiring sign repeatedly went try talk build rapport manager month took credit card ended maxing out needed food essential simply money for depression kinda spiraled control plan place hang friend time took rope going use broke buy another dad life prior this invited come stay family la tried together working hard job here retail job waking early doing nofap working x week try depression check despite that want kill die still not future able continue school dfchs told not help pay college not long beginning college fucking problem coming dorm asking question causing stress week feel like barely supporting myself honestly not talked brother youngest one birthday april th feel like failed them not talked grandma feel like disappointment mom keep calling month telling gonna kill feel like love her bent fucking backwards trying help bringing brother making sure talk my grandma rest mom family not talk cursed horribly tried her
"Really struggling with self image - any tips to build self confidence? I have struggled with my overall view of myself for as long as I can remember - in particular with my weight. Where im at, at the moment feels like the worst its ever been, I keep having full blown melt downs about how much I repulse myself. Throughout my life Ive been on more diets than I can count and tried multiple different excercise routines. About 4 years ago I gained 30kgs really fast and after moping and feeling sorry for myself i decided i would kick it up a notch and started taking things really serious. 6 days a week at the gym, personal training, strict meal plans - the works. This worked so well at the beginning, I dropped 18kgs in the first few months. It came to a halt and for the past 3 years I've continued to lose weight slower - im at about 25 kilos down in total now. I thought I would be further along by now.   I live and work on the road at the moment travelling from town to town so ive dropped the gym membership but I try and make up for it with doing workout sessions on my own, lots of hiking and swimming. I recently switched to a keto diet from the previous meal plan I was on. I am fitter than I have ever been and what I can achieve now in a physical capacity is so much greater than ever before in my life (I was less fit even as a child)  The problem I have is that im still so overweight, I very rarely find anything that fits me in stores and i dont have an address to order things online. I feel like people could look at me and assume I dont give a fuck about my health when I do and that makes me feel worse. Anytime I talk to doctors about unrelated issues they make it about my weight. I feel like outwardly im the worst version of myself, I look in the mirror and get angry. Does anyone have any tips on how to pull myself out of this? I feel so crushed when I'm reminded of my weight because I dont feel how I look. I want to be proud of my achievements but I'm not, I feel annoyed that its not better and I havent reached a bigger goal. I think ill never reach a weight I'm happy with - which is not only devastating to me but bothers me so much more because im genuinely trying my hardest. Ive had hiccups and times where I've literally tried to eat my feelings away but I always pick myself up and try again. I dont know how many more times I can fail.   In an effort to help me stay on track my partner started eating the same foods as me. Weightloss had never been his goal or something he was focusing on, it was just to make it easier on me not to see him eating a toasted cheese sandwich while I was eating salad with no dressing. He wanted to limit the temptation and helped cook me awesome healthy meals that tasted a million times better than anything I cooked. For him it worked a treat, he was never overweight just a bit stocky, but hes since lost so much weight and looks amazing. And whilst im so happy for him it hurts as it just shows how much progress i havent made. As stupid as it sounds I think it highlights my weight more when we're together cause he looks so fit and healthy and I look like I sit around eating kfc all day. I want to be confident or at least more confident but I'm so critical on myself I cant even begin to let the confidence through.

"I'm a single white gentleman, 27. I've dealt with depression since the age of 7, and it has gotten worse over the years. Not having any family / friends is not helping any (it's been this way for years now). My depression got really bad when I graduated from high school and my parents turned their backs on me. While everyone else was looking forward to a bright future, my parents had the attitude of ""screw you, you're on your own"". They refuse to help me in any way, which has caused unbelievable problems for me (unemployment being the biggest thing). Having a friend is not the cure - all, but it would definitely help a lot. I feel so hopeless and alone. I tried other internet groups, but found them to be nothing but a waste of time. Just looking for someone who can relate, and won't judge me.

I studied philosophy/psychology during my undergrad and I feel extremely content with all the knowledge I’ve accumulated, but it just feels like I’m getting old. It feels like friends are moving away, the world is getting smaller, less wondrous. It’s like realizing I’m too old to aspire to great things like being an astronaut or something. I feel like my role models are way too big, or that things are just downhill from here. So I’m asking myself questions like why bother working? Why bother moving forward?

I no longer live at home, and couldn't live at home if I wanted to because of the space and my relatives here for the first time to America, which is fine with me. I recently found out about drama going on at home, it involves my mom and dad and my female cousin.   About one ago before my relatives moved here from vietnam, something had happen to my great aunt , she had given advice to my mom about being careful about her husband and any woman in the house. What had happen to my great aunt was, she caught her husband trying to cheat with her niece. I'm not sure if they actually had an affair or whatnot, but just warning her to be careful about this type of situation in the house. I really feel like it was unfair for my great aunt to put these thoughts in my mom's head because why do that? Especially when they are about to come and move in and start a new life in America.   So back to the drama, my dad has been super stress out calling me, telling me that he is unable to handle the situation anymore. He said my mom thinks he is looking at my female cousin in a inappropriate way. She happens to be 19 years old. My dad just thinks this is crazy, he works 2 jobs (15 hours a day) trying to pay mortgage and pay all the bills. My mom doesn't work and stays home. My dad has been calling me saying he only is able to sleep 4 hours a night because every time he comes home from work, my mom is always giving him a ear full, and hes to the point where he can't take it anymore and thinking about just continuing to pay the bills and living somewhere else. I tried to talk to my mom and want to be completely open minded about the situation, she just tells me that I dont know, and she can tell the way he acts at home. Her reasoning is, she just can tell by the way he looks at her. She said she knows that he won't ever take it that far by cheating, but its her being jealous which is causing all this drama.   In the house consist of my female cousin, male cousin, aunt and uncle. Also my other aunt and uncle and my mom and dad. its a pretty full house, and my parents have been arguing every other night. My aunt called me tonight trying to keep the peace in the house and calm down both sides. My female cousin and her family has no idea this is going on. But most likely suspect something because of the arguing between my parents and im afraid they will find out whats going on soon enough, which will be really embarrassing. I feel like my mom and dad need marriage counseling, or my mom needs to see a therapist, but being asian they don't believe in these types of counseling classes and will be very hard to get my mom to agree to do something like this.      ---      **tl;dr**: What can I do to help out my family? I'm not trying to take sides but I really don't think my dad would ever cheat on my mom. Every time I try to talk some sense Into my mom, she always ends up getting mad, and saying everyone thinks I'm crazy but I'm not. They have been married for 30 years and my dad has always worked two jobs his entire life to make sure all the bills are paid, that we have food and shelter.",0,asian parent jealousy do hello asian american son trying help family family vietnam moved month ago living mom dad longer live home not live home wanted space relative time america fine me recently drama going home involves mom dad female cousin ago relative moved vietnam happen great aunt given advice mom careful husband woman house happen great aunt wa caught husband trying cheat niece not sure actually affair whatnot just warning careful type situation house really feel like unfair great aunt thought mom head that especially come start new life america drama dad super stress calling me telling unable handle situation anymore said mom think looking female cousin inappropriate way happens year old dad just think crazy work job hour day trying pay mortgage pay bill mom doe not work stay home dad calling saying able sleep hour night time come home work mom giving ear full he point anymore thinking just continuing pay bill living else tried talk mom want completely open minded situation just tell dont know tell way act home reasoning is just tell way look her said know not far cheating jealous causing drama house consist female cousin male cousin aunt uncle aunt uncle mom dad pretty house parent arguing night aunt called tonight trying peace house calm side female cousin family idea going on likely suspect arguing parent im afraid whats going soon enough really embarrassing feel like mom dad need marriage counseling mom need therapist asian not believe type counseling class hard mom agree like this tlr help family not trying side really not think dad cheat mom time try talk sense mom end getting mad saying think crazy not married year dad worked job entire life make sure bill paid food shelter

" I work for Lilac Window Cleaning and this is my story.  I started working here back in 1988 and left after a year and came back 6 years later after I let go by Main window cleaning after a medical problem.  It was a good time to move on so it was no big deal.  Me and the owner seem to hit heads a lot but it also happens with the other guys too.  Jim (owner) is not the easiest person to get along with.  At the beginning of the day Jim gives us a route sheet with all the informsation about the Equipment  we need for the day and a list and addresses of the jobs and who we are working with and the truck  we will take.  Most of the time he has to remember who won't work together that week because of arguments we  have had the last few days. It's not easy doing his job most of the time.

I’m afraid of my family falling apart after my grandfather passes away I need advice. My mother passed away from cancer 4 years ago now. I have two brothers in their 20s. One hasn’t finished his associates and the other in nursing school but takes every chance he can get to get away from helping the family. My father is an irresponsible alcoholic who thinks it’s beneath him to wash even his own dishes.  I currently live in San Francisco and trying to get into medical school and making up for my precious failures in college.  My grandfather is the patriarch of the family. He always has been and has been the glue to keeping it together. I’m worried that if my grandfather passes away that my father will go deeper into alcoholism and my little brother will be his forever caretaker.   I’m so scared. I’m the only female in my family left and I feel so overwhelmed and burdened. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to go. I don’t even know how to help myself.   There have been days when I’ve come and my father has passed out on the couch and hasn’t eaten. I just feel like I come from a trashy family and there’s no way out. ,0,afraid family falling apart grandfather pass away need advice mother passed away cancer year ago now brother s not finished associate nursing school take chance away helping family father irresponsible alcoholic think beneath wash dish currently live san francisco trying medical school making precious failure college grandfather patriarch family glue keeping together worried grandfather pass away father deeper alcoholism little brother forever caretaker scared female family left feel overwhelmed burdened not know do not know go not know help myself day come father passed couch not eaten just feel like come trashy family way out

"Does anyone else's depression show itself as exhaustion? I find as I get older, that certain heavy type of exhaustion that can only be caused by depression gets more and more pervasive. As soon as things start going downhill, the unexplained tiredness hits and I become like a zombie. I have no energy to do my normal daily tasks, the thought of going through my evening routine before bed seems like climbing a fucking mountain; I barely have the energy to do anything other than sit on the couch and stare into space. The physical lethargy always comes hand-in-hand with the Brain Fog. Forget trying to study, forget going through the bills, my brain can't handle anything except moving my index finger to scroll down Reddit and watching cheap entertainment on youtube or Netflix.

"Abnormal I'm so used to being depressed and anxious I'm amazed how people can act normally in general. I'm like how do they do it? I'm so used to feeling uncomfortable in my skin that its normal for me to feel awkward and weird in social situations. The fact that people everywhere don't have to deal with this everyday and just can ""be themselves"" without breaking a nervous sweat blows my mind. I feel abnormal and tired of it. This is the part people don't understand. I've met shy people and they are effective communicators once they get over that initial hesitancy of speaking. When you're overcome with social anxiety, depression, and feelings of incompetency its damn near impossible to speak or want to. Every word you utter to someone is misinterpreted because half the time its not heard or not what you meant to say. So frustrating I can't explain it but its killing me.

"Anyone else hate talking about depression specifically because all the attempts at help feel fake? Guess it’s stupid posting this, all things considered, but I’m a moron anyway and besides that I’m also looking just to see if I’m alone in thinking this. Like at this point I’d rather just hear comments from people who are also feeling down. “Help” from others makes me fucking angry at them, especially strangers, because it doesn’t do anything. It doesn’t make me feel better to be told “things will get better!”, it doesn’t help to be told I’m loved, and in the event people bring up stuff like “you’ll never get to have a family” (yes this does happen as though that matters) it makes me want to actually hurt them in real life. I don’t and can’t, but holy shit. I don’t even like when friends try to make me feel better anymore because it feels like they don’t even get the point.  What sucks though is trying to get over that primal instinct to not kill myself. I don’t particularly want to live and I really don’t want to live past ~40, but my dumb animal brain just thinks “owie death and pain bad” and won’t let me do it. I’m kinda hoping that maybe instead I can get into an accident or just get really ill.",1,hate talking depression specifically attempt help feel fake guess stupid posting this thing considered moron looking just thinking this like point just hear comment people feeling down help make fucking angry them especially stranger doe not anything doe not make feel better told thing better doe not help told loved event people bring stuff like family yes doe happen matter make want actually hurt real life not cannot holy shit not like friend try make feel better anymore feel like not point suck trying primal instinct not kill myself not particularly want live really not want live past dumb animal brain just think owie death pain bad not let it kinda hoping maybe instead accident just really ill

" So I have to be in this wedding in September.  I am trying to convince my friend Peter M to escort me to this wedding, but so far he will not commit to it.  My Hubby is going to be out of town on a camping trip so I am going to have to go solo if Peter doesn't go.  It is a Bolivian/Irish wedding.  The bride is about 5'2"" and the groom is about 6'4"", plus the groom looks about as Irish as Irish can get complete with red hair and freckles and the Bride looks truly Bolivian.  They are quite an interesting couple to see.   So the problem is that the only people I will know at the entire wedding are the bride, groom and bride's mother.  Most of the people on the bride's side are from Bolivia and speak very little English.  I know that this sounds like a very fun event, but if Peter M was the good friend that he says he is he would come and escort me ; )  Oh, here is the interesting thing:  The groom has multiple piercings.  Including his penis and testicles.  I am all okay with the piercing thing and everything, but I can't help but thinking the ding-a-ling piercing has got to hurt.  Oh and he did them all himself.  I asked the bride to be if urine and other bodily fluids leak out the other holes and she confirmed that they did.  Dude, that means his dick is like a freaking colander!  That is a bit strange to me.  I would be afraid to have sex with him (not that I would want to anyway), for fear that some parts of his penis rings would come off inside of me and then have to be located.  Okay that would be just TOO CREEPY!  Okay enough rambling about nothing, anyway my daughter is crying and my husband is ignoring her.

He hung himself when i was 20. i'm 34 now and just finding it hard to get a handle on life. I never really thought of what happened to me as being a big deal but my partner has made me think again about what happened in the past. my most formative years were disrupted and i believe i am still suffering as a result.  I suppose i am just wondering if anyone has any advice or knows of anyone who was in a similar situation. I am in counseling at the moment and am just starting to face my demons.

"I’ve been depressed all my life and I’m just tired I️’m finding it harder and harder everyday. I’m almost 23 years old and I️ can’t even function properly. I️ feel like I️ have the mental capacity of a child sometimes because I️ don’t know how to do anything. My entire life I️ lived in fear of my parents and now that I’m out I️ just can’t function at all. I️ had to quit my job because I️ couldn’t handle being at work in my emotional state. I️ can’t handle people being vaguely negative towards me. I feel awful because now it’s just my fiancé working, but he says that it’s okay that I️ need time.. I can’t help but feel he resents me for it. I don’t even know how we’re going to pay for our wedding. I️ don’t know anything about feminine hygiene, or how to brush/style my hair. It’s just matted in knots and up in a bun, or if it looks decent enough I’ll put it in a ponytail. I️ don’t know how to keep friends because I️ was constantly grounded for everything. I️ spent most of my life alone in my room, when I️ was grounded I️ wasn’t allowed to eat dinner with the family. I️ have 2 step sisters, one half sister, and 3 half brothers. All from 3 different marriages not including my parents’ since I’m their only child. And I’m not close with any of them. I️ don’t even know all of their ages. I️ didn’t have mother figure in my life because my stepmoms were just either physically abusive or emotionally. My dad was a drunk, and just controlled every aspect of my life yelling at me if I️ didn’t want to do something or had different opinions than him “you think you’re in control of your life but you’re not. You belong to me” or make weird sexual remarks in front of his friend when I️ would have a friend over “oh you two girls are probably going to kiss and rollover on top of each other” thankfully not in front of her. But sadly our friendship didn’t really last very long. Then he convinced me to get really drunk when I️ went to go visit from college and his friend tried taking advantage of me when I️ was trying to sleep it off in my room. I️ want to get a better job than the one I️ had previously but my upkeep is awful and I️ probably wouldn’t get hired.. And I️ know I️ have to better myself but it’s just so hard I️ just don’t know where to start. I️ have no money. No friends. I️ practically have no family because I️ never want to go back. I️ dropped out of school because I️ couldn’t afford it anymore because my dad stole the money I️ saved up. But even if he didn’t I️ probably still would’ve dropped out because I️ couldn’t pick a major, I️ kept changing it, and I️ feel like a loser because I️ was supposed to graduate this year. I️ used to be really good at math and writing and now I️ can’t even remember simple math or how to use proper grammar. I️ find myself not knowing how to spell words or using the wrong ones and it just makes me feel so stupid. I️ hate it. I️ was diagnosed with BPD and I️ can’t even afford to treat it. My car stopped working, and I️ don’t even know how to use a bus. I️ hate my life. I️ hate everything. I’m just so tired of it all. I️ already went to a mental facility for a month and I️ still can’t function. I️ can’t bring myself to end it all because I️ love my fiancé more than anything. He’s been my one true friend since high school, even if we only spoke at school, he’s always been there for me. I️ can’t leave him. I️ don’t know what to do. I don’t have clear thinking. I️ hate that I’m so black and white, I’m just trying to be gray.   I’m so sorry this is so long, this is my first post, it’ll probably get removed because I️ don’t even know how to use reddit but whatever venting this out helps a bit even if no one reads it.

"I've posted a few times on these forums and everyone has always been so helpful and supportive, so I'm hoping I can get some help with this.  For the last few weeks, my depression has been so horrendous, worse than it's ever been, that I have not been able to go to work.  I keep calling in sick, and then when I can finally make myself go, I hide in the bathroom crying or go to an empty office (not in my cubicle) and call my mother and cry to her.  I've been in touch with my pdoc, who is in the process of passing me off to another doctor.   Granted, it's at my request, as he is not on my insurance.  However, he's not willing to put me on any other types of medications since he won't be seeing me regularly.  I've spoken to my long - time pdoc from Dallas, my hometown, and he knows me very well.  I trust him more than any other doctor, which is not saying much, but he says that I'm unipolar, aka major depressive disorder, and a mood stabilizer would be the next best thing to try since all the antidepressants are not working.  (was taking 30mg celexa, just upped to 40mg when this all started.)  I'm seeing a new pdoc that's covered by my insurance on Monday, so maybe things will move forward.  Ok, so back to the work thing.  My supervisor is not sympathetic to my problem.  In all fairness, I have not told her details.  I find that most people do not consider mental disease a real medical problem.  She suggested that I talk to Human Resources about taking some type of leave if I don't know when I'll be better.  I'm working on that and hoping one of these doctors will sign for me.  The biggest problem I have is the guilt over missing work.  I never imagined that the depression could get so bad that I couldn't just suit up and show up.  That's been my motto every time things get rough.  I guess I'm looking for validation here.  If I really do have it in my to get to work, I certainly can't find it.  I'm a very responsible person, so this is not like me.  The only time I've ever called in sick is when I was having depression issues, but never more than one day.  Everyone gets a sick day, and I never get the flu or anything, so I don't feel guilty about those days.   What do I do?  Am I looking at this the wrong way?  It's so hard to be objective when you are so low.  My saving grace is that my parents (who are far away in Dallas) are being the most supportive people in the world.  They believe me when I say I just can't get to work, since that's not like me, but that's not like them either, so I know they want me to get there if I can.

"I'm new here. But, I would like to know how to tell if I'm in depression. I have no idea where to post this at, but since I'm new here I guess this is the best place. Plus I can't start a new topic so... Well, anyway, here's how it is: Some days I can go without thinking about her, but at night, when I rest my head on my pillow, she eventually runs across my mind. When I say she, I mean my ex. More like.... I'm her ex. But eh... this took place a while back. Maybe like.... a year and a half. I met her 3 years ago in High-school. She was my very first true girlfriend and I didn't want anything to mess that up, but somehow I did that myself... or something along those lines. After a while of missing someone it doesn't really matter who was the blame for what. Sometimes when I make music I sing lyrics about her and how I want another chance and whatever. I'm not really obsessed with her or anything, but I sometimes want to just forget about her all at once, or wish I could go back 3 years. I guess that might be linked to regrets? Anyway, this whole thing is sort of an ON-OFF type thing, where sometimes I can't help but think about how it was, and sometimes, she's that last thing on my mind. Sort of like I put her on the back of my mind not to think about her, and save my hurt of later?? ... If that sounds right... Maybe I need a shrink. Who knows.... maybe i just need another girl.... But I'm pretty sure no other girl is going to want to listen to me talk about my past relationships. Anyway, feedback is appreciated",1,new here but like know tell depression idea post at new guess best place plus start new topic so well anyway is day thinking her night rest head pillow eventually run mind say she mean ex like ex eh took place back maybe like year half met year ago highschool true girlfriend did not want mess up did myself line missing doe not really matter blame what make music sing lyric want chance whatever not really obsessed anything want just forget once wish year guess linked regret anyway thing sort onoff type thing help think wa sometimes thing mind sort like mind not think her save hurt later sound right maybe need shrink know maybe just need girl pretty sure girl going want listen talk past relationship anyway feedback appreciated

"No friend left behind? *short* I have a small tight knit group of friends, 6 of us total, who have been friends since early high school years (so about 10/15 years at least).  Everybody has their annoying qualities but one of our friends tends to annoy every one of us at different points. This has never changed our friendship.  Recently, 4 of them have decided that we should make plans without the “annoying one”. They have begun a group text about plans for hanging out which don’t include her just because they don’t know if they can handle her. I love my friends but I feel this is absolutely horrible to do behind someone’s back, especially someone who they’ve been friends with for so long. I would be devastated if they did that to me and I have a feeling she will find out one way or another. Because of that, I don’t want to be in the discussion with them at all and won’t attend any event they plan in such a sneaky way.

"Thoughts on multi-family and multi-generational households and family disagreements Basically, I married into a Filipino family, and my MIL owns a fairly large chunk of farmland. She routinely expresses a desire for ""all of us"" (myself, my wife, our two kids, my sister-in-law and her husband, my brother-in-law, his wife, and his kid) to build a large house with a large living area. Each of us (read: each family) would get our own rooms, everyone would live together, and we'd all be one big happy family.  Except, not. I have a number of reasons for saying ""absolutely not"". Maybe it's my POV as someone that was raised in America, but I value independence and privacy. I want my own life, and my wife feels the same. Having family involved in everything you do, always having your kids being compared to other kids in the family, and always being treated like a child just sounds like hell. Not having the freedom to have sex or even choose what to have for dinner sounds like hell. No thanks.  It's be really easy if her MIL wasn't a good person, but she is probably the most kindhearted person I've ever met. She's always there to help us out, financially or if we need anything else. We're there for her the best we can, too, of course. So it feels really bad to turn it down, especially since I understand enough about her culture to know that this would feel like a slap in the face. And there's the financial aspect, since the land is already family-owned. Acting disinterested doesn't work.

"Trying to repair a lost friendship First time poster here so sorry if I don’t explain things very well  So a few months ago I went on a trip with my friend and both of our boyfriends. I got a little controlling with the planning of the trip and that caused some tension. And after they went to a party they didn’t want us accompanying them to I got upset and distanced myself a little. This lead to her boyfriend and I having an argument. Where he stated if I weren’t a girl he’d ‘bash me’.   After this we haven’t spoken but the friend recently contacted my mother to check in on how she was with some local flooding.  This has made me think that she still cares for me, and I still greatly care for her.  I’m having trouble approaching how to contact her. And while I know that it was said in anger I feel like I deserve an apology from her boyfriend, or at least reassurance that he won’t ever actually attack me.   Is it unreasonable to want an apology from him? Should I let it go?   I feel I should also note I do have sever anxiety, that’s why I struggle with situations like these so much.

"Mom treats me like a stray cat and siblings like gold My younger brother and sister are 10/11 years younger than I am. We have an older brother but he no longer speaks to our mother and has t for about 5 years. I’m an adult now and I fully support myself and have since I was 18. As soon as I graduated high school and child support stopped, I was tossed out of my moms with nothing but garbage bags filled with my clothes. I was told I had to live with father even tho my mother had just bought a house with her husband and my youngest siblings. My stepfather never like me and always kept me separate from their family. They would go to dinner every Friday night and I had to stay home bc he would flip out and many other mean things. To my step dad, I was a stray cat who didn’t belong near his children. My mother never stuck up for me and stayed with him until I was in my mid 20s when he cheated on her and left her. I was raised dysfunctional but bc of that I long for a close, supportive family. Once he was out of the picture, I was able to create relationships with my sister and brother. My siblings are now in their late teens and I’m 26. I’ve struggled immensely on my own I had no choice. I could have 3 dollars to my name and my mother wiuld take it from me for coffee etc. if she picked anything up for me I had to give her the money ASAP. Soon as child support stopped, legit the day I graduated i had to live with my dad and mother gave me only garbage bags with clothes.  good. Anything that had been mine was now my sisters (bedroom set, jewelry stand, American girl dolls list goes on. Now years later, my mother makes sure my brother and sister have everything and anything the very best of. Designer everything, newest clothes shoes, technology. When it comes to me, my mother doesn’t do anything at all. If she buys the coffee I am to give her to $2 but reversed she would die if I asked for the money back for he coffee. Now foremost, I’m fully aware I am an adult and can support myself. It has nothing to do with what my mother does for siblings it’s how she treats me compared to her treatment of siblings. For instance, I asked to use sisters perfumes that smelled good and was told no it’s her expensive kind. I’m not to use anything of my brother or sisters actually. My brother s d sister themselves do not care about this stuff it’s just my mom. When cleaning my face, my younger brother is allowed to use my sisters face cream or anything really bc well they are siblings. But i am not allowed to use the very same thing. If my mother is getting rid of things she will charge me full price. If she orders pizza and I eat a couple pieces I have to pay her half the money. Point I’m getting at is that she treats me like im not good enough to use my sister expensive designer perfume or face wash etc. she can buy the best of the best for them but charges me if I need anything. Holidays she spends thousands on them and if she does anything for me she only gives me gift she receives for free for spending so much as PINK etc .im not expecting to be equal. Again I’m an adult and can buy myself things but she can’t spend even $25 on a gas card or something lol I should add that it is expected of me to get her and siblings expensive gifts for their bdays and Xmas. Moms bday is in January if I happen to be broke and can only afford a $25 dunkin card, my bday in February she will get me something small or a $5 dunkin card.

"When I was twelve, one of my younger sisters got leukemia. Despite my failing memory I can still remember a lot of what happened back then. I can remember being picked up at the park where I was playing to rush to the hospital where my sister had been getting tested. You could say I was whisked away from my innocence, but you're pretentious and I'm not. I can remember how my mother broke the news to me. And how her voice cracked a little when I asked how bad she had it. I can remember sitting in the front room of my grandparent's place, where I was staying so my parents could be with my sister in hospital, speaking to my cousin and saying that I felt it was somehow my fault. What followed was roughly a year of total disruption. My sister became the focus, understandably, while the rest of us learned to cope with the cloud hanging over us. Where a small rise in temperature could send hearts racing. But that has mostly been forgotten. Not blocked away, just forgotten. It was another age and doesn't feel real anymore. In the past few months the hospital has been doing a study of ex-patients and their families. Tonight it was my turn to do the phone interview. I'd been avoiding it, mostly because I'm lazy and I only ever seem to do things that I feel will be enjoyable to me. Anyway, so they called through and I spoke. I don't think there were really any surprises, although it was bizarre when I became conscious to the fact that I occurred to her getting cancer as it or that. I think I only said cancer once in the entire interview. Does that mean I'm crazy? Struggling to cope? I don't know. Of the questions they asked, I don't think I answered any that would cause a worry.",1,twelve younger sister got leukemia despite failing memory remember lot happened then remember picked park playing rush hospital sister getting tested say whisked away innocence pretentious not remember mother broke news me voice cracked little asked bad it remember sitting room grandparent place staying parent sister hospital speaking cousin saying felt fault followed roughly year total disruption sister focus understandably rest learned cope cloud hanging u small rise temperature send heart racing forgotten not blocked away just forgotten age doe not feel real anymore past month hospital doing study expatients family tonight turn phone interview avoiding it lazy thing feel enjoyable me anyway called spoke not think really surprise bizarre conscious fact occurred getting cancer that think said cancer entire interview doe mean crazy struggling cope not know question asked not think answered cause worry
"My dad is about to be 65. I'm scared suddenly at the age, and I'm sad because the last few years I wasted and didn't see him enough. He's a very healthy, smart person. Do I still have quality years for us to do activities together? Wondering if anyone can tell me it's all going to be okay in the sense that 65 is not that old, and that I still have time to make memories and learn from my dad at his age. I'm 26. The concept of him having nothing new to teach me and needing me to take care of him now is truly devastating, because it's hitting me how much time has gone by, and just the idea of me being more capable than my father is a bit scary. He's healthy, smart, independent, wise. He still seems the same as he always did except for being a bit more gray, and you can see the age in his face a bit clearer. He drives himself around, works, volunteers, has a long distance relationship. He just seems to be a bit upset and nervous about the state of my life. Like I'm always complaining and yammering about something and it's hard on him. Yet all he wants to do is help me, so he keeps trying, and every time, he just gets put through the ringer and it's hard on him. I feel so bad because I say very harsh things and he's such a fragile person, trying so hard to be tough in this world. And I know shocking the system when you're old is hard on you. So I'm trying to just be mature, put all of the mess behind me, and ensure evevery time him and I are together now, he can see that I'm all good, grown up, and not going to make everything bad for him again.

"Cousin I’ve not seen for 25+ years trash talking me to my son (sorry long post) I just need a rant and maybe some advice on what to tell my son.   My youngest son (15) came home last night and said he was invited to a party this weekend and could he go, after all the ‘mum checks’ I gave permission.   He then proceeded to tell me that the mum of his friend ‘hates me and that I hate her’ and I found this odd as I don’t particularly hate anyone and certainly not one of his acquaintances mums.   It turns out that she is a cousin of mine who I haven’t seen for 25+ years since the death of our grandfather, her father accused me of stealing my grandads Home and contents, not true but I did care for my grandfather at his home, that I bought, and my grandfather lived rent (and bill) free for 2 years prior to his death.   When he passed away, my uncle said he wanted things from the home for himself (I had no issue with that) and when my uncle (this lady’s dad) said he wanted the TV I said he could take the rent book for it too (my grandad rented it from a local place). My uncle was pissed but accepted that it was rented. I also put into boxes all the things my grandad had willed my aunts and uncles for them to take away after the funeral - some couldn’t bear to and I put it in storage for them to take at a later date.   Now I’ve lived in my home since then and over the years changed the house to my taste and extended it. Unbeknownst to myself (until last night) each time I changed something my uncle has bad mouthed me to other family members and run me down, convincing others that I stole the house from them (was a rental property when my grandfather moved in and it was myself who purchased it). Over the years I have noticed that my family are not very communicative with me but I’ve put it down to initially my brothers death (4 years after my grandad) and then my mums (a few years later). But after speaking to others in the family last night I’ve discovered what has been said about me.   Now I don’t particularly give a damn about what’s said about me but I am upset that my cousin has told my son that I hate her, he is autistic and things like this stick in his head. Last night I just said something like ‘I don’t know the lady how can I hate her? And is that something you think I would do?’ To which he agreed that it wasn’t something I’d say/do.   My problem is the party, the parents are going to be there (one of the reasons I’m allowing him to go) and I’m concerned that they will trash talk me to him and how do I explain to him that some people just believe what they want regardless of what the truth is? I don’t want to give him all this information before he goes as it’s not really a problem unless my cousin makes it one, of you see what I mean.   Thank you if you made it this far and any advice would be appreciated.

"26 thinking of moving family upset  Okay so this past 5 months have been overwhelming. I’ve had a lot of major things happen. I got married in October and over the past year I’ve been connecting with my father and half brothers (who I just consider brotthers) and that whole side off the family. My dads never been apart of my life. I saw him probably about 4 times out of my 26 years on earth. The last time until this past week I saw my dad was when I was 10 so 16 years ago. That was also the last time I ever flew on a plane. I decided to fly down about two weeks ago for a week and I had such a good time connecting with my brothers and my oldest brothers wife and my nephew and grandparents and everyone! I loved the idea of everyone together closely and always at each others houses and I got along so well with my brothers and it was really nice. My brother and sister in law decide to that they’re going to move back to Florida where my dad and dads family is and they all really want me to move there. They love the idea of us getting close as a family and setting traditions and spending holidays together. Honestly I love that idea. My problem is my mother raised me, she’s always been there for me. She has nobody other than me. She doesn’t even have a car I drive her places. My grandmother who is also soo important to me she’s my second mother she’s been in a nursing home for 10 years and she’s confused a lot but still not that confused. The thought of leaving them makes me want to cry and I feel like I couldn’t. My mom would feel so betrayed and angry at me. She’s already feeling a little hurt because I’m getting closer with my dad that family. Which is wrong but she has a lot of issues of her own. The thought of leaving my grandma I could never. :( I just don’t know what to do. I’ve never left NY my husband also has his father here and his father would hate me if I brought “his son” away. My husband acts like he dose not care but ofcose he must. I just don’t know what to do I feel so stuck like if I even considered moving I’d feel so selfish and horrible. I couldn’t leave my mom and I feel like she wouldn’t come with me she’d be so angry that I was “choosing my father who did nothing for me and his family who ignored me” over staying near her. Idk this is probably all too soon also but I just want to form good relationships with my brothers and nephew and soon to be niece. And my dad. I don’t want my life to pass away and miss it all. Ever since I came back from visiting them for a week my mom has been giving me such a guilt trip about spending my money to go visit them or how she feels used and it’s crazy to me. Idk what to do But this is for sure a rant.

I'm asking myself, if is it normal to eat all of your friends snack or take so much of it without asking if you can do it? I'm not being racist here. But does it have correlation with a culture?

"We were all given about five minutes to decipher what the fuck this meant. Now, Mr. Runge had a reputation for being a tough teacher. He wouldn't let you get away with ANYTHING. If you fell asleep in his class because you were out all night in some cornfield with a bonfire and a bottle of Jack, he'd kick your desk in such a way that your head would fly upward at warp speed and your hangover would instantly get very very bad, and then suddenly disappear. Mr. Runge had some freaky special power that students couldn't tap into. I knew what the acronym stood for. But that's only because my high school boyfriend was a year ahead of me and gave me a heads up on how the first day with the Jolly Green Giant would play out. ""He's going to write this on the board, make you feel incredibly stupid and then it will be over."" TINSTAAFL, pronounced TinStaffel. There Is No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. Runge went on to explain that ""free"" didn't exist. The ""free"" lunches at college tours were paid for when your parents registered you were charged a ""service"" fee. Or, more on my level, Clinique never REALLY has a ""Free Gift with Purchase"". Because, you see...you have to make the purchase, dumb ass! And they over charge every other product just enough so that you're really paying for your ""free"" gift. This burst my bubble. Because now, whenever I take something marketed as free, I know I'm paying some sort of overhead or some poor schmuck is working extra hard so that I can get 2.5 ounces more of my favorite shampoo for the price of the regular size! You would think that I would have held on to this knowledge while looking for apartments. While scanning the ads, I bypassed the ones that used words like ""full of character"", because I knew that meant dump and ""TLC needed"", because I knew that meant dump. The one I honed in on boasted country living, quiet, serene, pond, lots o' land and everything included! I love where I live. I can't say it enough. If I didn't think raccoons would eat me at this hour, I'd jump on top of the roof and scream to the surrounding hills ""I love you and all your coniferous smells and the creatures you shelter!"" (Yeah, apparently the rooftop would make me a tad wordy.) My landlords are awesome people. Salt of the earth. Nice, down-home, trusting folk. And, as the contract for country people reads, ""Coon Hounds Must Be Owned and Bred"". I had never seen a breed of this type until I moved here. The momma dog was so sweet and gentle and quiet. She was quite the fatty too! Then suddenly she wasn't. And in her pen were ten little squeaky pups, eyes shut tight, blindly falling into food and water dishes, only to be rescued by momma. Cute, no? Who doesn't love puppies?? (If you bring Jackson up, I'll have to cut you.) It's been about month. Puppies have found their voices. All ten of them. And even the momma is begging for a release. Tigger is in the window, constantly doing a head count to make sure everyone is in their place and not a single one wanders off into oblivion. He's exhausted. Momma is exhausted because at night she performs a constant howl that cracks my heart. She's begging to be released from those needy fucking kids for at least ONE night of respite. And I'm exhausted. Because momma won't shut up and deal with her fate and every time a puppy so much as peeps, gaymancat is all over my head doing a get-up-because-they-might-run-into-traffic-and-get-hit-by-one-of-the-four-cars-that-pass-by-here-at-night dance.

"FIL &amp; BIL literally make themselves at home when they visit I like my home to look nice when guests come over. Sometimes I’ll have a lightly scented candle on in the bathroom or hallway or I’ll turn on a lamp to light up my entryway. The kitchen is always set buffet style to make it easy for everyone to serve themselves. I always make sure to make my guest bedroom is welcoming. Like fluffy pillows, comfy comforter, extra linens, working tv. You get the idea.   Whenever my FIL comes to visit it irks TF out of me when he makes these little adjustments while he’s here. I recently noticed that he’ll blow out the candle in the bathroom. Like WTF?! I know this cause I went in there before and after him once. He’ll also just randomly walk over to turn off my hallway lamp when he’s only been here for like 20 minutes. A few years ago, when he lived with us for a minute he rearranged my guest bedroom AND would rearrange everything around in my kitchen! I’m like wtf, I like my keurig right where it is! Thank you!   Another wtf, we have a sectional that sits about 7-8 people comfortably when FIL/Bro IL come over they insist on spreading out and lay across the whole damn thing. Do they offer me a seat when I come over? No. It’s only until my bf scoots over to make room for me so I can squeeze in to sit somewhere at the end of the couch.   Oh and bro in law? He always makes sure we know he eats gluten free. FYI he is NOT allergic to gluten and insists that “If the package doesn’t say Gluten Free it’s not gluten free.” Everyone knows not to start that argument with him,  there’s no point. Even if I mention that if my friend who has celiac disease can eat something it’s gluten free. He just shakes his head like idk what I’m talking about.  I don’t really say anything cause for 1 FIL is old and for 2 they are both only over a couple times a month. What’s the point anyway when I forget all about it the following day? They’re here for the SuperBowl and I’m aggressively writing this as I’m squished into the corner of my own couch. Would you guys even say anything? What would you say or do? And how much longer is the super bowl?!

He has become to the point where everything I do is monitored he checks my cell phone to see who has called, checks my EMails to see who wrote, calls me 2 - 3 a day to see what I am doing, won't ""allow"" me to go over to my friend's house, who I have known for almost 20 years, without him being there, and checks the history on the computer to see what web sites I visited.

"My best friend’s husband shot himself friday night. I’m angry. He was a manly man. All of us. All of his friends encouraged him to get help but he grew up in a world, in a house, that thought mental health professionals were quacks. He thought that taking medicine for something going on in your head was weak. This was an entirely medical problem that could have been prevented. So I’m mad. At him for leaving my best friend a 26 year old widow, at the people who raised him, at society, for telling him it’s weak to take medicine, at whatever the fuck higher power may be responsible for this stupid, senseless waste. I’m guilty for not trying to do more. I’m heartbroken that I’ll never talk to him again or hear him play his guitar or see him turn a piece of wood into something beautiful.

"A letter to … my sister, who has conquered her depression The letter you always wanted to write...  Family stuff happened and those wounds in you festered and festered. No one knew at the beginning. You hid it well under your sleeves and at the back of your eyes.  Before it all happened, I sometimes looked at you and thought that this would happen to you. It is the way you used to hold your emotion. It is as if you were full to the brim with it, but you forced it down, shoved it into a box  and hid it away. It was strange, but I was too young to understand. And then, slowly but surely, it took you over. You were so young. In my worst nightmares I imagined finding your lifeless body. I couldn’t wake you up. You wouldn’t wake up. My darling sister, even now I still imagine your cold body. How can such a deathly and frightening disease exist? You wasted away. Your cheeks were concave, and you didn’t even have to bend over for every bone of your spine to be visible. Your sharp wit and intelligent mind dulled. Your eyes were dark holes in your face. They were so empty. You slept all afternoon and night. I would lay my cardigan over you so you wouldn’t get cold. But I don’t think it made a difference. You were lost to us, floating in some different universe with no anchor or thread holding you to us. And then you tried to end it all. Multiple times. When I think about it, I blame you sometimes. But I know that the blame is not really towards you. It is towards me, of course. I am your sister. I should have been your protector. Is it OK if I say that I couldn’t really do anything but stand there and watch it run its course? Or is that just an excuse?  You are my best friend, even though I am not always yours. I wish I would be kinder to you, but I probably will always hold some of myself away. Maybe I am punishing myself. I don’t know. No one can say it didn’t take a toll on all of us. You probably don’t remember, but we were going to the corner shop together once. As we chatted, you were vehement that you were a failure. I asked you, what on earth were you a failure at? What life had you lived that you possibly could have failed? And you said: “I failed at life.” So what was the alternative, my dear? Death? I’m telling you, I lived those few years in the fear that you would be taken away from us by your own hand.  Even as I am writing this, I don’t know where to start or end. In my mind, it is such a mess. It doesn’t matter because you are well now. I have never seen someone work harder. You are radiant and beautiful and clever and sarcastic and so special I couldn’t tell you how much if I tried. I hope you will always appreciate the battles you have fought and won. I hope you always believe you are a success.  I wish you all the happiness you deserve.  Love you, babe.

" My first post in this new journal that I've opened and am right now trying to think of something interesting to write. My name is not Catelina, but I've had friends think that it was, because I get referred to it very often. My sister calls me Catelina Marguerita, and once when I told a friend that and I commented that I was an alcoholic drink, they said ""delicious"". It gains some strange, perhaps unusual responses.  I am at university at the moment, studying a bachelor of science and am presently contemplating where it will take me. In no way, whatsoever, do I want to be a Scientist or a teacher. I am enamoured with the idea of becoming a doctor, and believe that the glasses which I got a week ago will aid me in my quest to take up this occupation. Yes, I do believe glasses make you smarter; it's a nice way to look at things, isn't it? But, seven years is an awful long wait to take up when you're craving in the most facist sense to be away from the world of studying.  I saw a pile of Medical lecture notes on sale at the university book store for $1.45, and was so utterly tempted to pick one up, pay for it, and go and sit in on the lectures. Then, when I finally get there, I will know most of the content and will breeze through the course... perhaps.  I have lived in the same house for all eighteen years of my life and my parents have been married for over 30 years, which in this day and age, is an achievement in itself, seeing as so many of my friend's parents are divorced, separated or estranged. I have a friend, who has moved so often in her life and craves to leave the place where she lives right now and for a time in our past, was so angry at me, I have come to realise, that I didn't want to go with her. But what people don't seem to understand is that living in the same house for so long, with parents who still love each other and siblings who are not on anti-depressents, is a remarkable, albeit maybe boring, life. I cannot think of a place I would rather be, even if I have only been on a plane once in my life and that was six months ago.

"I walked out of a job yesterday. I took my 'dream job' in early January, only to discover that it isn't my dream job at all.  I thought I would like working in a medical office, but this particular medical office has two doctors, one part-time staff member, and a cluster of other problems.     I quit on Friday; the owner asked me to come in yesterday and meet, and I did, but I didn't stay long, because she didn't show up and the other doctors on staff acted like my resignation never even happened.    I've compiled a list of why I quit. Here's a short sample:   - I hate the hours (7A-7P 3 days a week, 7A-2P 2 days a week; an hour lunch break was promised in the new hire handbook but is frowned upon by staff as a lack of commitment/dedication)   - There are religious currents, including periodic 'prayer meetings' throughout the day.  I was treated dismissively when I objected and stated I'm not religious.  The owner is okay with the prayers, and says it brings staff closer together.   - I was offered a management position, but after being hired, was told ""I know nothing, and might manage eventually, but right now was incapable of doing so.""   - I was trained for three or so days before being expected to run insurance billing, keep rooms clean and do therapies, and run the front desk.   - Staff is expected to remain available on evenings and weekends for PR events.   I know that quitting was the best decision - ""sticking it out"" would have been detrimental to my mental health, and I would have had no time to interview for other opportunities.  Still, at the same time, I can't help but feel like a burden to my husband.     After leaving yesterday, I hiked 4 miles to the top of an area mountain (really just a big hill, it's a foothills mountain) and had a conversation with myself as to whether or not I intended to jump.  I intentionally didn't take my gun with me because I never know.    I am afraid of being a disappointment, and I am afraid of never being a 'conventional,' 'functional' human.  I am second guessing my decision to leave. I already have other opportunities presenting themselves to me and I am lucky enough to have some money put away... but I don't want to be a failure.    I can feel depression symptoms creeping up on me again, and I'm trying to fend them off.  I forced myself into a per-diem position today, just to keep in a routine.    I'm trying to re-frame this as an opportunity, but right now, it feels like a literal nightmare.

"Why would people keep telling me “you’re a good person”, I don’t feel like I’m a good person. Yesterday my best friend sent me a text telling me “you’re a good person, you’ll find someone.”  All I could think was no I don’t want to find just someone, I wanna be with someone who resembles the guy I can’t forget. Not anybody will do and if I’m such a good person he would have stayed friends with me.  My mother said everyone I’m close with or knows me well including my aunt, relatives all of them wants me to take care of someone either their own daughter meaning my aunts and then other cases my elder sister because they could see I have a good heart but then she ended the conversation with when you have a lover/boyfriend you’ll forget about me, about us. Which judging by past experiences her words has some truth in it.   In my mind all of this is some kind of a cosmic joke because I don’t think I would find someone like him who’d be interested in me. This leads to nowhere, I feel so sick and tired of it all already their expectations and my lack of motivation to improve myself and poor sense of self-worth.

"My husband is not my best friend. Friends jealous of friends. My husband isn’t my best friend and that’s ok. In fact, it’s more than ok. Yes, he is my friend but our connection is deeper than that. We are building our lives as one. Sharing our day to day, filling them with constant support and security. I love my husband deeply but we are also different people. He plays video games and I do arts and crafts. He watches war movies and I go to brunch. I value my friendships &amp; consider them a priority in a different light than the priority my spousal relationship takes. Because of our many differences, I take and make the time to build on my friendships. If their partners are their best friends, I am truly so happy for them. What a beautiful thing to find.    However, I tend to notice that those are the friends that often get jealous of my other friendships or the plans I make with others. I hope that I make it clear how much they mean to me because that is all I can do. I don’t have a live-in best friend. I don’t spend all of my hours or all of my days with my partner. I have different people in my life for different reasons. I love them all. I think my biggest insecurity/worry is that feeling that I’m sometimes expected to put my life, needs or other friendships on hold while those with “partner bffs” hang out with their bffs. Not everyone can understand, so I have to teach myself to let go of the guilt. Truthfully though I just reaaaaallly wish my friends with bff partners could understand so they’d stop getting jealous. They want me to be and still call me their best friend but they already have one. We were “best friends” till they found their partners and I harbor zero resentment for that, all I want is happiness for all of us. Sure you can have more than one best friend, but I simply don’t take their priority anymore.  But so I have to move on, ya know? I keep in touch and try to maintain our friendship but when I get closer to a different friend it angers them in a way. If I make plans for a trip with a different friend I am ridden with guilt. Do I just tell myself to get over it? I’m doing my best? I know there’s nothing but love on my part. So it’s not truly my problem, right? (Easier said than done with that mindset though)  TLDR: my friends boyfriends/fiancés are their best friends. They get jealous of me getting close with or making plans with other friends while theyhangs with their bff partners.

"How I'm coping with the end of a friendship... I'm writing this partly because I find it therapeutic and partly because I'm hoping it'll help others.( I have self-proclaimed good coping skills.)  So, my XBFF didn't do anything [i]to[/i] me. There was no defining moment. I just decided that (as much as I love her) she doesn't compliment my life anymore.  She's having a few relationship issues. As a married woman, I empathize with her. However, over the last 6 months she's started to get a little... Crazy.   I'm a very blunt and controversial person. Always have been, always will be. I keep an IG account full of controversial and offensive memes. Some people like it, some people don't. Anyway, I've been going through a rough time myself so I cope by posting passive-aggressive memes. Every single thing I post she takes personally. It got to the point in which everything I said or did (online or in the real world) she somehow thought was about her. It wasn't. It got to the point in which I was afraid to speak because I was afraid she'd take something the wrong way.  Anyway, she went an entire week without speaking to me even though I sent her multiple texts. Maybe this was the moment, but I decided that I will not tolerate that type of power struggle. We're adults - you don't get to ignore someone because you don't like what they're saying and that's always been an issue with her: if she doesn't like what you have to say she comes up with delusional explanations as to why. Basically, she can never be wrong and if you think one negative thing about something related to her, she'll freak out, accuse you of being jealous even though she's the one not actually happy. The negativity is starting with her.  For example, we tried to book a trip together. We've been trying for years and they never happen. Finally, I just told her that I'm no longer interested in planning trips with her because she's not willing to accommodate my demanding work schedule. Now, she's the first to admit her job is shit and it's been a huge source of insecurity for her, but when I tell her that my job doesn't allow me to book off as easily as hers (she works cash and doesn't really have a true job) she'll freak out and accuse me of putting her down. No. I'm stating the facts: You can book off your job easily. I can't. That's not me putting down your job. That's me telling you why I can't tell my boss on Friday I'm leaving for two weeks the following Monday.  (This is just one example, but they all pretty much follow the same context: Something TRUE she doesn't like about herself is brought to attention and she accuses you of being a bad friend.)  After a week of being MIA she decides to text me. No. It doesn't work like that. I'm not interested in what she has to say. So, I tell her to get over herself, not everything in the world revolves around her, etc. Of course, she thinks she's completely innocent and that all she was trying to do was explain HER feelings and I tell her I'm not interested. Again, it's not always about her. She did not once seek clarification about ANYTHING I said. She jumped to random conclusions and just assumed I sit here and think about her. In the end, that's what frustrates me. I just can't be friends with someone who thinks everything is about her.  In sum, I just decided to protect myself.

"I lost my closest So recently one of my biggest fears came true. I don’t have many friends and that’s because I always feared that a friend would know me and just completely hate me. So I only had like two or three friends for this reason. Then I was diagnosed with depression, so I tried to tell my best friend at the time that I had depression and that over the last year or so that may be why I had done some weird drastic things (in this time I never did anything to harm my friend emotionally or physically). While I was telling him he became hostile towards me and then told who told his girlfriend who in turn became hostile towards me and told me I was a shit person (A shit father and a shit boyfriend). That was 3 months ago. So I stopped talking to them because of that I tried going to my closest friend about something I never talked about ever to anyone and it caused them to walk away. Then I sought out help and I started to recover from the issue the and I made regular updates about on Facebook because I was finally ready to talk about my issue, but one day when I said I lost a friend him and the other person I thought was my friend attacked me in the comments because I made a side comment about what happened between us. I never mentioned names. I tried to move on with my life but they were the only friends I really had and I so completely distraught because I don’t know what to do or honestly really how to make new friends. I feel like now since it has finally happened to me I can deal with people who I thought were friends turning their backs on me but I just don’t know how to make friends. Can I get some advice on what to do. Also I’m a 22 year old guy with a baby and a happy relationship.

"Best friend drifting away? I've debated whether to post this or not for ages. My best friend is like my sister and has been there for me through really hard times, and I've been there for her. We're similar in so many ways, run a small blog together and I love her to bits. On new years eve she was set up with a guy and they've been dating ever since. Since their first date, we hardly talk. She doesn't even want to talk about him much, and when she does she talks about quitting her job for him, and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. They go out drinking a lot, almost every night, it seems like he spoils her and she's told me she's really happy.  But at the same time her anxiety is still bad. She's lost her ambition to travel, adventure and take up new hobbies. She doesn't contribute to the blog anymore but says she still wants to carry it on (our domain doesn't expire until July). I feel like I've lost my best friend, but I'm mostly scared that she's already lost herself because of a guy and I just don't know what to do. I've stopped chasing her for plans because she's always busy now (we used to meet up weekly), and stopped messaging because there won't be a reply. She checks up on me every now and then and I haven't been doing well at all, but I don't want the few times we talk to be negative and depressing. I just feel so clueless right now and I miss her.

"Journal Entry - 12:23AM Monday, December 4th, 2017 Just thought I'd share my thoughts from last night. I occasionally lurk Reddit looking for a relatable story, so I figured I'd share some of my own thoughts.  I don't want a job.   The hardest part of having a job is talking. It's bad enough that I have to make eye contact. Having to speak on top of that can be nerve wrecking.   Meeting new people is also tough. It's even tougher when you're the new one. Who are these people? Do I even want to know you? Are you going to try and get to know me? Am I going to allow it?  Customers are easier to deal with, but just a drag to have to deal with. It can be monotonous. Often, it’s annoying. But all the while, I just feel drained.   There are good days at work. But there are also bad days. And those bad days make the lasting impression, in my experience.   I'm thankful for those good days. But the bad days remind me that I want better for myself.  I'm tired of working in restaurants. I'm tired of wearing a stupid hat my hair can barely fit under. I'm tired of repeating phrases I'm told to repeat. I'm tired of seeing the disgusting process of how people’s shitty food is prepared. I'm tired of cooking, something I enjoy, feeling soulless.   Historically, preparing a meal and feeding someone is a virtuous act, at least to me. The commoditization of it is a bit of a shame.  I detest consumerism, generally speaking. Customers are not my favorite people. Along with restaurants, I hope to avoid customer interaction at my next job.  I really don't want any job. When it comes to time &amp; energy vs. money, I'm all for the money until I find out what I have to do. Then my my time &amp; energy feels more valuable. Because it is more valuable.",1,journal entry am monday december th just thought share thought night occasionally lurk reddit looking relatable story figured share thought not want job hardest having job talking bad make eye contact having speak nerve wrecking meeting new people tough tougher new one people want know you going try know me going allow it customer easier deal with just drag deal with monotonous often annoying while just feel drained good day work bad day bad day make lasting impression experience thankful good day bad day remind want better myself tired working restaurant tired wearing stupid hat hair barely fit under tired repeating phrase told repeat tired seeing disgusting process people shitty food prepared tired cooking enjoy feeling soulless historically preparing meal feeding virtuous act me commoditization bit shame detest consumerism generally speaking customer not favorite people restaurant hope avoid customer interaction job really not want job come time amp energy v money money do time amp energy feel valuable valuable

" Where does one start?? I guess by telling a bit about who I am, where I have been and where I hope to go.  I live in Northern California in a little community called Yankee Hill. We are situated between the towns (cities??) of Chico and Oroville about 80 miles north of Sacramento. I live on 10 beautiful acres where I bring dogs I rescue from the pound (no sweet sounding titles like ""Animal Shelter"" here!!) and train them to work with people with disabilities.  One February 20th of 2004, we placed our programs first Service Dog to work with a young girl with Cerebral Palsy. It was a really exciting event and after following up on them for the past 3 months, they are doing really great.   I am now working with 3 other dogs. One is being trained to work as a the ears for a hard-of-hearing person who also seems to be picking up the tasks needed to assist someone in a wheelchair. Her name is Polly and we believe that she is a mix of German Shepherd and Yellow Lab.  Starr is a Black Lab mix and she is being trained to assist someone with a wheelchair. Her progress seems to be slower, but I am still hoping that she will pass the program. If not, we will find her a good home as a pet or possibly keep her to be our demonstration dog. The only real problem with her is that she is not real confident in big city environments. She is about 15 months old, so there is still time to help her overcome her issues.  Then we have Mocha, a Chocolate Lab. We chose her for a specific client who has a spinal condition that is making it progressively harder for him to walk on his own. Mocha is being trained to wear a harness with a handle that he can hang onto and offer him balance and stability. We have only been working with her for a couple months. She also has had some issues for us to help resolve, the most major is a fear of having either her ears or tail touched as if she was picked up by them at some time. The other is that she has had a hard time staying in one place when someone moves near her. Both of these things are being addressed and we are having great success with her developing more confidence in a variety of situations.  Well, that is a start. I'll stop here and see how this looks and pick it up again later this evening.

"4 years Tuesday Tuesday will be the four year anniversary of when my dad committed suicide. My 21st birthday was this weekend and I got pretty drunk and started to think about it and I just cried and cried in the Uber with my friends. I’m really thankful for them. But there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about him. The thing is, he was an asshole. To me and my mom. I didn’t know he was depressed, I just thought he was mean and didn’t love me. I really do think I could’ve prevented it if I’d known. I’ve been extremely depressed ever since it happened. I don’t think I’ll ever be normal again.",1,year tuesday tuesday year anniversary dad committed suicide st birthday weekend got pretty drunk started think just cried cried uber friend really thankful them not day go not think him thing is asshole mom did not know depressed just thought mean did not love me really think prevented known extremely depressed happened not think normal again
"I’m losing the girl I’ve been with for 7 years and it’s because of my drug use, really bummed I’ve been with this girl since 9th grade I’m now 23 and I can honestly say I love her with my whole heart. I’ve been abusing drugs of all variety since I was 15, herion, meth, pills, uppers, downers, alcohol, marijuana, research chemicals, it doesn’t matter, but I prefer if it fits into a syringe. I have been to rehab 9 times since I was 15 I’d get sober then relapse sober then relapse sober etc.. I have had legal trouble and been in and out of jail she has been with me through it all, she has always been my better half. No words can explain how blessed I’ve been to have her. This past relapse I was clean for two years before hand and our relationship had never been better we were both happy we both trusted and we both loved no matter what. She helped me get my g.e.d. And she helped me through my grandfathers death (he raised me). I had subtle depression over it I felt like that was normal losing a loved one and all, but I eventually stopped doing the things I was susposed to to maintain my sobriety, I felt like I was cured and no longer needed all the recovery stuff. I was wrong. So one day I decided to take some benzodiazepines and that made me go straight to crystal meth in the time frame of a week I was back shooting meth spending all of my money on it and staying up for days. When on meth I have serious delusions I accused her of cheating on me I actually believed these delusions with my whole heart I felt so betrayed and hurt, I wanted to die. What I feel like really did it was I accused her of cheating on Facebook. Even after multiple people telling me I was wrong I couldn’t believe it, I just KNEW everybody was out to get me especially her, I was very unfair and called her names and called her at all hours of the night, completely out of character of me. After being the good loving boyfriend she knows and loves for two years I suddenly became a monster. I totaled the vehicle I owned and went to jail for possession with intent (Benzodiazepines) possession of marijuana and dui. I sat there for two months (thank god) while I was in there she told me she just couldn’t do this with me anymore and told me she has somebody else in her life, this crushed me. I contemplated suicide while I was in there fought anybody that even remotely rubbed me the wrong way and lost my appetite couldn’t sleep. So I get out and I know that I should just stay away from her because I love her and I don’t want to hinder her pursuing something else, I respected her decision to move on, after all I did publicly humiliate her. So right now I have been sober a month and I feel good in a clear minded healthy way, but I have this hole where she used to be I find myself riding around for hours thinking and crying. I’m very upset that I let this happen, currently I just can’t keep my mind off of her I just want our love and friendship back. I am very depressed and lately I have thought about using again but I would rather kill myself before I do that, I can’t get high anymore I would honestly rather be dead. I’m going to NA meetings, going to church, praying all day, but I can’t seem to ever feel better about losing her no matter what positive things I do. I’d rather be dead then to live without her and I don’t know what else to do.",1,losing girl year drug use really bummed girl th grade honestly say love heart abusing drug variety herion meth pill upper downer alcohol marijuana research chemical doe not matter prefer fit syringe rehab time sober relapse sober relapse sober etc legal trouble jail all better half word explain blessed her past relapse clean year hand relationship better happy trusted loved matter what helped ged helped grandfather death he raised me subtle depression felt like normal losing loved all eventually stopped doing thing susposed maintain sobriety felt like cured longer needed recovery stuff wrong day decided benzodiazepine straight crystal meth time frame week shooting meth spending money staying day meth delusion accused cheating actually believed delusion heart felt betrayed hurt wanted die feel like really did accused cheating facebook multiple people telling wrong not believe it just knew everybody especially her unfair called name called hour night completely character me good loving boyfriend know love year suddenly monster totaled vehicle owned went jail possession intent benzodiazepine possession marijuana duo sat month thank god told just not anymore told somebody life crushed me contemplated suicide fought anybody remotely rubbed wrong way lost appetite not sleep know just stay away love not want hinder pursuing else respected decision on did publicly humiliate her right sober month feel good clear minded healthy way hole used riding hour thinking cry upset let happen currently just mind just want love friendship back depressed lately thought using kill that high anymore honestly dead going na meeting going church praying day feel better losing matter positive thing do dead live not know do
" Good day my children. If you are reading this, you already know, I now have a blog.     Well school is almost over. Dear God, if this school year was moving any slower it'd be going backwards. Turns out I'm not getting straight A's, son-of-a-bitch! The end of school makes me think of Dazed and Confused, the best summer movie in the history of the world. But I just can't wait for school to end so I can fill my summer with sleeping until noon and then going outside and falling asleep by the pool. Sleeping is a skill that most don't take seriously, I can sleep whenever, or whereever I want, jealous? Well I've been ranting the whole time, which is good because I need to get it out every now and then. Well on a side note, the Sox won today, 9-0. Did Derek Lowe win a game? Wow, maybe we can keep this going, and I can't wait for the Pedro-Bonds match up. Well now that I'm an Old Navy employee I can use walkie talkies and not be made fun. Ok, I must be going now, I hope you all enjoyed and come back again, peace.

"ok, so today i had another freak out. I woke up feeling good ... it was supposed to be my first therapy session (which i and my boyfriend were happy about) and then after this i was supposed to meet up with my boyfriend for lunch, check my test marks, and then go to the library with my boyfriend to study. These plans changed...  When i walked into the therapy office, they said no appointment was scheduled. All of a sudden i felt really rejected, not worthy of an appointment (like they gave it to someone else), anxious, sick to my stomach, a little dizzy. I've been waiting since February for this appointment! I couldn't deal with my anger properly or the fact that my plans for therapy were ruined today. I started stuttering kind of i kind of got all dazed out and really sick when the receptionist wanted to schedule another appointment. So, it's tomorrow at 9am ... 9am!!! What bastards.  Anyway, so because i got all weird ... i didn't want to be around people. I called my boyfriend ... couldn't get a hold of him. I cancelled .... didn't check my marks, didn't go to the library, or lunch or see my boyfriend. I left. I told my boyfriend i had bad anxiety.  So, now he wants a ""break.""  And I've been in my room since i got home (since about 1pm) .... feeling really low and weird and lightheaded ....  I've been rocking a lot too on my rocking chair ... it's a weird compulsive soothing mechanism i have. Don't ask.  I'm mad at my boyfriend because he decided to take a break when i needed him most. Is this cold or what?! At the same time i understand: he wants his ""brain clear"" for exam studying.  Whatever. I guess it's hard being with a depressed, neurotic girl. No one wants to be with a depressed girl. Let's not kid ourselves here.

"What are ways to connect to a close person who is depressed ? I’ve been dating a girl for 7 months and I’ve notice her cycle of moving close to me then pushing me away . She gets secluded, and almost checked her self into a hospital last month but she has never really opened up about the complex feelings so I’m wondering how can help relate ? How can get her to know I’m here to listen and attempt to understand . I tell her often how special she is to me, I get her flowers at her doorstep, I show the love but recently, I’m trying to connect a different way.   She is currently pushing me away again, so I asked to take her out to dinner the tomorrow, no response . I won’t give up on her but I want to make sure the next moves are in the right direction . I want to walk by her side thru this journey . I won’t give up on her either .

"My stepmom wont let me back in my old home, mixed feelings. My wife is pregnant with our second child and she didn’t want to keep it at first because raising one is tough but two sounds impossible.

My dad offered money but it was about help.  I thought it was a win win. My dad was complaining earlier how he was bored and he is working part time since ss and pension wasn’t enough. I was going to pay rent. And I thought grandparents like kids. I wasn’t expecting them to raise them.   I can understand my stepmom side but i cant help but feel if my mom was still around this wouldn’t have been an issue. My dad doesn’t care but he has to look out for his wife.

I was at the cinema, eating popcorn. Out of no where i'm sleeping in a bed with some weirdo and they are holding a cane. At that point I woke up, and then when I went back to sleep I had rather enjoyable dreams about my school, and how I was causing it mass destruction. Ahh, the joys of an unconcious mind.

"The toughest pill to swallow is that I care about the girl most I've lost all motivation for my academic life, have basically no ambition left and have just been floating around doing nothing the past few years. My parents trusted me and are probably disgusted by me right now.   I've lost all my Bitcoin in a fire. I was one of the early pioneers and had literally a couple hundred thousand dollars worth not too long ago. I'll admit this one was getting to me quite a bit. Especially since I could've prevented it.  But you know what really incited and is still by far the biggest part of my depression? A girl. A stupid, uninteresting, normal ass girl. But I love her.

"I am lost. I do not know what to do. Hey guys. This is my first post here, I made this account because I need to vent and I have no one else to listen to me. To an outsider, my life seems okay: I am married to a great guy, I have a good job that pays well, my family is healthy and I have friends. To me, my life is unbearable. I am not ungrateful and I really do appreciate everything that I have in my life, but it is very hard for me to get out of bed in the morning and live out my day.   One of my main problems is my weight. I know this may seem vain to some of you, but it is a huge problem for me, someone who already struggles with low self esteem. I have gained about 15 lbs in a year, and I cannot control what I eat, nor can I motivate myself to work out. I do not recognize myself anymore, none of my old clothes fit, and I can't seem to be able to do anything about it. Every day, I tell myself, I will eat healthy, I will make better decisions, I will not hate myself, I will not speak down to myself, etc... Each and every day, I fail. This kills me.   My second problem is that I have a well paying job but it is very stressful and demanding. It takes up the majority of my day and this stress feeds into my poor eating habits. I have considered quitting but I cannot justify saying no to the money. I am scared that if I quit to try to focus on myself, I will just eat more and more because I will be less busy.   I am a lazy, unmotivated person who is notorious for making excuses for herself. I really need some guidance. I hate waking up. I hate getting out of bed. I do not even want to shower or function. I don't know what to do.

"A rant, I guess I had to come off of my antidepressants for medical testing. I'm finally off of them and I can't take this. I didn't think they were working and I definitely wasn't where I wanted to be when I was at my maximum dose, but oh my God. I started them for anxiety mostly so I'm surprised that I'm relapsing so hard into depression. I just wish I didn't exist-- eh, better yet I wish I didn't have to participate in every day life. I don't know what to do. I used to have so much motivation to finish my college work and now I have none. I have finals that start tomorrow that I haven't studied for at all. Like, not even a little. And somehow I don't care. That's just not like me. I'm exhausted from putting so much effort in all the time. I exhausted from being stressed all the time. I don't want to keep doing this. I just want to sleep. And to think I have four more years ahead of me. I don't know what I'm going to do. I already feel like a failure. I keep thinking that maybe I could find something to take my mind off things but I have no hobbies. I don't enjoy anything any more. Not even eating, which I used to love probably too much but hey. I want to lie in my floor and watch the days pass by me. I don't want to have to keep trying. Another thing is everything and everyone irritates the living hell out of me now. The smallest thing sends me over the edge into my spiral. Three weeks ago if I spilled my coffee I would have laughed it off. It happened the other day and I cried for hours and was so angry.   Three weeks ago I was better than this. And I'm crashing all of a sudden. I don't know how I'm going to study for my finals and maintain my GPA to keep my scholarships. I'm fucked probably. My therapist is not that great and I haven't seen her in awhile and I don't have money to go back to her. My psych appointment isn't until late January, after my medical procedure.

"Cold turkey of Escitalopram So let me begin this by saying this is a terrible idea and I should definitely taper off with the help of my psychiatrist.  So, earlier this year after some lack of focus and insistent lethargy eventually my parents decided to take me to a psychiatrist. One thing leads to another and I am diagnosed with depression and put on a dose of escitalopram (generic form of Lexapro) 20mg a day. Have a history of depression on my mother's side, and they had all the symptoms pretty severely minus the suicidal ideation, which I believed supported their diagnosis.  So as school was finishing up and I had exams to study for, I spent most afternoons essentially consciously unconscious as I was too tired and struggling to keep a focus on homework and related tasks. Long story short told my parents I had been taking Adderall once and a while and we talked to the psychiatrist and he was very understanding and after trying to allow the SSRI to do its magic, he ultimately added an Adderall script to my regime.  So for some months I took the addy as needed and the anti-depressant as described (other than the days I forgot). So fast forward to summer and while I'm feeling marginally better, I was lead to believe the addy was doing most of the work.   So just last week I decided just to cold turkey the SSRI. Now, this was a slight test of seeing how I would react to abstaining from the meds (which is an awful idea). Strangely, I have noticed no real change whatsoever from when I was taking it to this past week of not taking it at all.  I am somewhat familiar with the omens regarding stopping an anti-depressant cold turkey and the associated rebound depression and serotonin-related issues, however, I am unsure why I haven't experienced anything. The optimistic side of me wants to explain this as my body just being weird and being able to withstand this drug-related anomaly. The pessimistic side of me believes that it's related to escitalopram somewhat length half-life and that a nightmarish hell awaits me very soon.  Just as a side note, at the same time as my depression diagnosis, I also got a blood test which delivered wonderful news that I had Lyme's Disease (which after much reading, I found exhibits many traits of depression and ADHD like disorders) and was promptly treated. Now I don't proclaim to be healed as I still exhibit a sense of lethargy, however, that might just be something I've become accustomed to and given getting out of my house, I am usually able to go out and be alive.  Obviously, not discussing this decision with my doctor is unnecessarily dangerous and naive, but I just don't enjoy taking the medication and this past week kind of supports my idea that I don't really need to take the medication if I am able to function fine without it.  Forgive me for this whole backstory of my last year, I just was unsure if some of this information might be useful in determining what's happening.  **tl;dr**: got lethargic and lacked focus this last year, diagnosed with depression and Lyme's disease, been on escitalopram since spring and Adderall (whenever I choose to take it) since mid-Mayish.  Have stopped taking escitalopram for about a week now and am not exhibiting any withdrawals or issues regarding the cold turkey. My question is: am I an anomaly or am I due for a bitter time in the near future?   QUICK EDIT: just wanna say I tried looking up this lack of side effects from cold turkey, but all I can seem to find is the side-effects of not taking the medication, so if someone has some website or anecdotal experience they can refer me to, that would be much appreciated :)",1,cold turkey escitalopram let begin saying terrible idea definitely taper help psychiatrist so earlier year lack focus insistent lethargy eventually parent decided psychiatrist thing lead diagnosed depression dose escitalopram generic form lexapro mg day history depression mother side symptom pretty severely minus suicidal ideation believed supported diagnosis school finishing exam study for spent afternoon essentially consciously unconscious tired struggling focus homework related task long story short told parent taking adderall talked psychiatrist understanding trying allow ssri magic ultimately added adderall script regime month took addy needed antidepressant described other day forgot fast forward summer feeling marginally better lead believe addy doing work just week decided just cold turkey ssri now slight test seeing react abstaining med which awful idea strangely noticed real change whatsoever taking past week not taking all somewhat familiar omen regarding stopping antidepressant cold turkey associated rebound depression serotoninrelated issue however unsure not experienced anything optimistic want explain body just weird able withstand drugrelated anomaly pessimistic belief related escitalopram somewhat length halflife nightmarish hell awaits soon just note time depression diagnosis got blood test delivered wonderful news lyme disease which reading exhibit trait depression adhd like disorder promptly treated not proclaim healed exhibit sense lethargy however just accustomed given getting house usually able alive obviously not discussing decision doctor unnecessarily dangerous naive just not enjoy taking medication past week kind support idea not really need medication able function fine it forgive backstory year just unsure information useful determining happening tlr got lethargic lacked focus year diagnosed depression lyme disease escitalopram spring adderall whenever choose it midmayish stopped taking escitalopram week not exhibiting withdrawal issue regarding cold turkey question is anomaly bitter time near future quick edit just wanna say tried looking lack effect cold turkey sideeffects not taking medication website anecdotal experience refer to appreciated

"How to deal with people who can't seem to be bothered with you? Question is fairly self-explanatory.   I ask this because recently (within the past 6 or so months), my supposed 'friends' have started to become quite distant with me and it's making me feel like total crap. They rarely ever contact me despite me having reached out a couple of times. It's all very fragmented. What hurts the most is I see them interacting with their other friends (on facebook etc.) and also that they have been online recently but still have not answered my messages. My friends used to be great, they used to consider me their closest friend and would reply quickly etc. But now I feel like I have been replaced and I have nobody left. Even back when I'd hang out with them, they'd be on their phone talking to these other friends of theirs and I feel so hurt.   Being alone sucks. No matter what, I can never seem to make friends with anyone new. The majority of other people my age are living it up, but I can't seem to do anything with anyone apart from my family. I feel like I'm missing out on something.  I feel so unwanted to the point I've started deleting all my social media to isolate myself even more. It's beginning to eat away at me and my depression is coming back, as much as I hate to admit it.  I do not know whether to take this opportunity to improve myself and pursue my own hobbies and basically just do things on my own, or attempt to reconnect with my friends/actively seek out people who will appreciate me.

"These parents physically hurt their teenage daughter by burning her with hot oil and hitting her with broomsticks due to her refusal to marrying a man much older than her who is paying $20,000. This horrendous story just goes to show that your family isn't always this happy loving caring group of people who want the best for you. Sometimes your family can be toxic and parents can be bad at their jobs, and it's very important to know when to say no, and walk away if you can. Especially if your culture and religion like this young girl tells you to never say no to your parents and obey their commands no matter what, It becomes very hard to go against them and say no, but it is essential to draw that line for your own safety.  https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/parents-daughter-abuse-forced-marriage-texas-cooking-oil-beat-bexar-county-maarib-al-hishmawi-a8274001.html",0,parent physically hurt teenage daughter burning hot oil hitting broomstick refusal marrying man older paying horrendous story just go family not happy loving caring group people want best you family toxic parent bad job important know say no walk away can especially culture religion like young girl tell say parent obey command matter what hard say no essential draw line safety
"I am too much of a coward to even kill myself I am posting this here, not primarily to garner attention or sympathy, but because I have nowhere else to turn and I don't know what to do with myself. I also want to try and combat some of the embarrassment and shame that I feel in regards to being clinically address, so perhaps voicing what I am thinking here, it could potentially be therapeutic for me.  Now that is out of the way,this might get quite long, so I will put a tldr at the end of this.  Context:  I am a 20 year old girl. My whole life, my sense of worth was dictated around whether I could make the people around me happy. I had extremely strict and controlling parents and so I had no real sense of worth other than the fact that at least I didn't harbour any malicious feelings towards anyone, or try and hurt anybody deliberately. I had normal teenage 'angst' and moody, brooding periods, but absolutely not depression at all. I was completely, for want of a better word, normal.  In April 2017, I first had feelings of depression, when I realised how badly I had hurt someone who used to be very important in my life. (it is an extremely long story and I am slightly more at peace with it now so I don't feel the need to explain because it would take forever). I was incapicitated for a week, I would cry constantly, not leave my bed, and my mum would scream at me and tell me she 'didn't have time to deal with my shit'. However I had a REASON for feeling this down, so whether this was the start of a biological depression, I am not quite sure.  Fast forward to October 2017. This is where my current situation and problems begin. I am currently studying abroad in Japan- something I have been envisioning and looking forward to for 10 years. Honestly, I had been constantly dreaming about this for an extremely long time. It was what I felt my life was gearing towards, everything led to this.  However, it all went downhill. My host family is incredibly lovely, I had made a couple friends on social media before even joining the university, and there were so many intercultural exchange opportunities to join. Yet, despite this, I could feel my mood slipping gradually. I have always been a shy person and not good with strangers, but I began to feel a creeping anxiety looming up on me, that told me to not bother others, that by interacting with others I was causing them inconvenience and discomfort, and the best thing for me to do was to just be alone.  I partly attribute it to the fact I had a really awful teacher in my first semester here. Now, I think some people might think that this might be a cultural shock issue, but I am pretty sure that she was crossing ANY acceptable line, no matter what culture. Firstly she would be very rude to me in front of all my classmates. Say if I came in without makeup, in jeans (like, still showered, hair done, not sweatpants or anything, just not completely dolled up) she would say in front of everyone 'Your face isn't pretty enough to not wear any makeup. You are scaring everyone. You know girls in Japan care about their appearance. You should do too, for everyone's sake'. (Also my Japanese is perfectly adequate to understand interactions like that, so I know for a fact that this wasn't a language barrier issue. ) If I got a question wrong in class she would say 'You know, I don't know why I bother asking planyourspontaneity for answers, she is so useless'. Or if we had to make example sentences she would pick examples like 'What does planyourspontaneity need? Oh planyourspontaneity needs to learn how to make some friends'. And this became like a running joke in my class. I have never been bullied, so I never learnt to grow a thick skin, so this (what felt like) daily victimisation began to really grate and tear down my self esteem. I felt isolated so my social anxiety caused me to isolate myself, and people ignoring me, creating a vicious circle. I began to be completely mute in class, ignoring the teacher, be on my phone, having headphones in, and this obviously spurred her on as she would berate me for how I was a terrible student. Also I feel like it might be relevant to say how I told this teacher that the reason why I was so withdrawn and using my phone a lot was because my stepfather was undergoing cancer treatment and I was worried (this was true). But she still kept calling me useless and 'the worst student I have ever taught' to everyone. If I seemed withdrawn though she would stroke my thighs and lower back and neck (I think this contact thing might be a cultural difference but still) in front of everyone, which obviously made them think I was a total freak. If I made eye contact with them, they would quickly shuffle away or look disgusted.  Around November-ish time I began to suffer with very extreme bouts of depression. I felt awfully ashamed- here I was living the dream I had longed for for about a decade, and I was here for some reason feeling absolutely dreadful. Even if I had had a fun day, I still had this lingering sadness, and I would get home and cry. I started seeing a counsellor which was one of the best decisions (or rather, my long distance boyfriend decided for me) I ever made.  In December time it reached the point where I would barely go to class because the idea of seeing people, going to class, and even just getting out of my bed just seemed overwhelmingly difficult to me. I would cry all the time, tug my hair and cut my forearms, and would call the suicide hotline. My teacher emailed me numerous times, all very inappropriately about how her parents were dying to and how I should turn to God (not that I don't think that that is a viable avenue for some people, it just seemed like weird advice from my teacher) I tried going on anti depressants (Escitalopram?) but they made me vomit after just one pill so I stopped straight away. I travelled with my long distance boyfriend who came to Japan to see me, and felt nothing. Then I went to Nagano with my host family, and felt some kind of peace, and calmness. This calmness and general mellowness resided in me for some time, until now.  Current situation:  My depression came back with a vengeance yesterday during the day. At lunch time I locked myself into the bathrooms to cry and cry. I took a tranquilliser that had been prescribed for me during bouts of extreme depression to curb the urge to self harm and it did nothing. I hate myself so much. This exchange, this is what I wanted my life to lead up to, and my fucking brain is ruining it all for me. Aside from this, I had nothing to look forward to in my life. I just want to be happy, I want for people to not hate me. I know most people hate me because of the way they act around me, they won't invite me to any class activities even if I am right there, and I will be the only one not in the class group chat, class karaoke nights, etc etc. Literally the only one. I am scared of going to intercultural lounges to interact with people because they all know each other from last semester, and I can't even talk to people in real life in the first place. I just feel like an alien. I don't feel like I was meant to be born in this world at all. All I want is to be suddenly transported into a different world. I don't want to be here anymore. I just want to be asleep forever. I want to be dead.  But I am scared of death. I wish I was religious so I had some motivation for either killing myself and going to heaven, or for fear of hell having motivation and stay alive. What if it hurts? What if the nothingness is unbearable?  But I want to be dead. Every time I see a train go by I want to jump so badly. I know my boyfriend and family would be sad but they would get over it. He would get a better, non depressed girlfriend so he doesn’t have to deal with my shit anymore. My dad has a new daughter he treats better than he ever did me. My mum would be devastated but I don’t know if I can hold on just for her sake.  Anyway, I know I am not such a loss to the world.

"Dealing with a spiteful sister-in-law? I'm 28, and we are all living under the same roof. I live with my mom and dad, and help take care of my grandparents.. I have fibromyalgia, chronic pain, migraines 4-5 times a week and have trouble getting out of bed some days. Brother (loses jobs frequently, can never keep his wife happy) she's become a very spiteful and distant person in the last 2 years. They decided to move in March of 2016 after not getting their way of getting help from my mom (who helps everyone and is the kindest and most selfless person you will ever meet). They have 3 kids, and now a fourth one on the way in May. Brother ""Dave"" and his wife gonna call her ""Vick"". Always go back and forth at one another, as he loses jobs and they both work (she's held a stable job and he hasn't), calls him lazy, P.O.S., a horrible father, our family made her the way she is now, tells her kids to ""suck it or, or stop crying"" when they get upset or hurt. She used to be the sweetest, kindest person ever. I REALLY liked this woman, and we got along great. I could never say a bad thing about her 10 years ago. Until, I came out in 2008 as gay. She was supportive or so I thought. Then wrote a long nasty letter to me after telling my mom she didn't want me holding my boyfriends hand around her kids, that she didn't want that exposed to them, etc. I called her a hypocrite and walked off, because she did all these things with her husband and more. Nothing more, nothing less.  Cause she was and I was sick of all her bull about me and her hating on the way I was. I don't say things unless something truly bothers me and I was at the last straw.    Said she didn't support me being gay, me being with my boyfriend was wrong, she doesn't want her kids around it, etc. Anyway, little bits of this kept coming up over the last 9 years and slowly grew distant from her. Last one me being worried about her being mad at me for something, as she came in and didn't talk  to me or respond to what I had said. I said is she mad at me? To my brother. He goes I don't think so. She then yells ""I'm not mad, STOP BEING SO DRAMATIC!"" I'm like wow.. completely out of character for her. I've never done anything to her to get spoken to like this.  1 year ago -- she called my brother a piece of sh*t for the 40th time. I got tired of it, her belittling him, throwing his things, telling him that our family are horrible people for the fights we get in once every 2 months. He looked defeated, he looked the saddest I've ever seen him. I asked what was wrong, he told me. I agreed with what he had said about her letting the children use the tablets too, that it was ridiculous that she's called him something so horrible over it. I was really angry at her, disappointed with her. We had gotten into a big fight after me coming out before as well and she denied everything that happened that day.    I whipped out my phone for this one -- so all the facts were here. Everything was caught on camera for the minute we got into it. After I go into my room, she comes and slams the door next to my room closed and says, ""You've got to me f'ing kidding me. Is he really siding with you. HELL NO!"" to my brother. I come out and say what's the problem? (My mistake, but no... no one in my family has ever said anything to this woman to keep the peace. They're afraid of her taking the grandchildren away and my mom loves them dearly and is afraid of having a bad relationship with her.) I say ""I'm tired of you calling my brother a piece of crap."" I yelled, ""Stop treating him like that, what the hell is wrong with you? Who says that to the person they love and are married to? Why do you belittle him so much when he's finally got a nice job. I can't believe anyone in this house doesn't say anything to you over the way you treat him, specially around your kids. You say we're saying bad words in front of them and you guys and making you this way, analyze yourself.""    She tells then to ""go back to your room, get a frigging job."" Then turns to my brother and says ""do something with your brother, go back to your room!""""I say no, you don't like what I have to say (and I speak for everyone in this house cause it's true). You can go."" This sparks her sister to message me -- telling me ""Never in my life have I been so disgusted with someone. Who do you think you are filming her!? The mother of your nephew and nieces raising your voice at her telling her to get out. I'm so disgusted, get the F' outta here!""    Brother wouldn't defend her after that happened. She went to my mom (who's like best friends with her) -- she didn't defend her. She then split with him for 8 months (this last August) that day. Now they're back together. Saying they're going to move and haven't. Ever since then, she's just been passive aggressive. Stands in the doorway and doesn't move when I need to get through. Is constantly rude when anyone says anything to her kids (when they're making a mess, yelling and telling adults to stop talking to them) unattended downstairs as she's on the couch upstairs. Telling my brother that I'm doing things when I haven't even spoken to this woman in months. I am so uncomfortable around her. I have said hi to her and things and have stopped, because it's a short ""hi"" and walks by. The last 6 months she's walked by me and hasn't said a word, no hi, no bye when she goes out the door. Walks by me or anyone in this house aside from my mom like we're not there.  I know this sounds pathetic coming from a man who's 28, but I'm actually sick and am developing actual dislike and almost even hate for this woman. She hogs the washer and dryer, tells me to turn my animal light off when she's going to bed (cause it's out where she sleeps in the upstairs loft). Tells me to get all my stuff out of there when it was my storage space and now my room is packed with all my things out there. Tells everyone to keep it down. You go down the stairs too loud (passed her) she will ask who's there and make a big deal out of it. If anyone says anything to their daughters being rude to us, they both snap (yes my brother too) and call us rude, guilt trip us and say ""they're 5 and 9 years old, this is the way youre going to talk to a kid!?!, or they were just trying to make a sandwich as they're telling us to ""stop taking to me or telling me what to do, you're not my mom or dad"" etc.  Is it bad that I want them all to move? I'm in my room most days when they're. I feel so trapped here, and I don't know what to do. I have no choice but to stay here until I find a job for people like me with chronic health issues - and they're never going to move because they constantly mooch off my mother.  She pays for their car accidents, their bills, their car rentals, their groceries, dinner, gives them money to go on dates and gas to go drive to work (even though they make their own money), etc.  My mom is starting to sort of agree she even wants them to move, and she won't step up and say anything to anyone. I tell her to or else I will. She goes ""NO DON'T!"" She's so afraid of these people -- and losing her grandkids.   I don't know what to do.",0,dealing spiteful sisterinlaw living roof live mom dad help care grandparent fibromyalgia chronic pain migraine time week trouble getting bed day brother loses job frequently wife happy spiteful distant person year decided march not getting way getting help mom who help kindest selfless person meet kid fourth way may brother dave wife gonna vick forth another loses job work she held stable job not call lazy po horrible father family way now tell kid suck or stop cry upset hurt used sweetest kindest person ever really liked woman got great say bad thing year ago until came gay supportive thought wrote long nasty letter telling mom did not want holding boyfriend hand kid did not want exposed them etc called hypocrite walked off did thing husband more more le cause sick bull hating way wa not say thing unless truly bother straw said did not support gay boyfriend wrong doe not want kid it etc anyway little bit kept coming year slowly grew distant her worried mad something came did not talk respond said said mad me brother go not think so yell i not mad stop dramatic like wow completely character her spoken like this year ago called brother piece sht th time got tired it belittling him throwing thing telling family horrible people fight month looked defeated looked saddest seen him asked wrong told me agreed said letting child use tablet too ridiculous called horrible it really angry her disappointed her gotten big fight coming denied happened day whipped phone fact here caught camera minute got it room come slam door room closed say you got fing kidding me really siding you hell no brother come say problem my mistake no family said woman peace afraid taking grandchild away mom love dearly afraid having bad relationship her say i tired calling brother piece crap yelled stop treating like that hell wrong you say person love married to belittle finally got nice job believe house doe not say way treat him specially kid say saying bad word guy making way analyze yourself tell go room frigging job turn brother say do brother roomi say no not like say and speak house cause true go spark sister message telling never life disgusted someone think filming her mother nephew niece raising voice telling out disgusted f outta here brother not defend happened went mom who like best friend her did not defend her split month this august day together saying going not then just passive aggressive stand doorway doe not need through constantly rude say kid when making mess yelling telling adult stop talking them unattended downstairs couch upstairs telling brother doing thing not spoken woman month uncomfortable her said hi thing stopped short hi walk by month walked not said word hi bye go door walk house aside mom like not there know sound pathetic coming man actually sick developing actual dislike hate woman hog washer dryer tell turn animal light going bed cause sleep upstairs loft tell stuff storage space room packed thing there tell down stair loud passed her ask make big deal it say daughter rude u snap yes brother too rude guilt trip say they year old way youre going talk kid just trying make sandwich telling stop taking telling do not mom dad etc bad want move room day are feel trapped here not know do choice stay job people like chronic health issue going constantly mooch mother pay car accident bill car rental grocery dinner give money date gas drive work even make money etc mom starting sort agree want move not step say anyone tell will go no dont afraid people losing grandkids not know do
" First I want to introduce myself, I live in Arkansas I am 39 and a mom to 4 (18, 15, 8 and 3) I have been on and off different antidepressants for almost 4 years. Started out with celexa after I had my last baby, went through some ppd and haven't been the same since. I was on celexa for 14 months then stopped for 7 months, then went back on it and totally had a bad reaction. Then came zoloft, that lasted about 3 months sent me in to some sort of mania, then there was wellbutrin, wanted to drive off the road in to the lake on that, then came effexor which I thought worked but apparently I also was going through rapid cycling, I kind of liked that. I spent 3 months on that and about a month on the wellbutrin. Then came paxil cr, was on that for 6 months but I just cant get past these mood swings and outbursts. So now I have been on Lexapro for almost 3 months, today the doctor decided to increase me to 20 mg and add lamictal for my mood swings. I am a little nervous about starting this new one. This rash I hear about sounds scary. I also take 1 mg of klonopin as needed(everyday) I just wonder if I will ever feel the same again, but then it has been so long that I don't know if I would even know what that feels like. Sorry to ramble on, but that's my story. I am to start the lamictal tonight. wish me luck!! If anyone has any input for me I would really appreciate it ",1,want introduce myself live arkansas mom different antidepressant year started celexa baby went ppd not since celexa month stopped month went totally bad reaction came zoloft lasted month sent sort mania wellbutrin wanted drive road lake that came effexor thought worked apparently going rapid cycling kind liked that spent month month wellbutrin came paxil cr month just past mood swing outburst lexapro month today doctor decided increase mg add lamictal mood swing little nervous starting new one rash hear sound scary mg klonopin neededeveryday just wonder feel again long not know know feel like sorry ramble on story start lamictal tonight wish luck input really appreciate
"before i start i want to apologize to everyone for not offering much support recently. For those of you not in a good place right now, i hope things start to ease for you soon. Sending my love to you all and i am thinking about everyone.  Lycan hope your hangover is well and truly gone and that you are ready for another week at work.  Well i went to the GP on thursday and she was really lovely, really listened to what i had to say and she wants me to go away and consider going on antidepressants, before i make a final decision.  While there she spotted a mole on my arm and she looked through this little gadget. She thinks its skin cancer (Melanoma) and has sent an urgent referral to the dermatologist. So i am now waiting on an appointment for a biopsy. I am kind of upset about it, i know they can probably get rid of it, but it doesn't stop the panic attacks and anxiety.   So all in, I am not in a good place right now, but hopefully things will start to get better soon.

"Stop and think for a moment It's like stumbling around in the darkness. You can't see, you can only feel. Blinded by the pain of reality.  You beg it to stop, as the throbbing in your heart grows stronger. But it's not gonna stop, no matter how hard you beg.  Your so called 'friends' abandon You, because your depression talk has gotten too dark.  But what's the worst part? That you can't control it? That you can't stop it? Maybe it's the fact that just maybe... just maybe you don't want It to stop.  You cling onto your pain, because after all..it's familiar. It's been with you for a while.  You stand upon the dark edge, upon the highest edge you could find.  You feel the wind blow in your face. You freeze. All the good moments, All the good people.

"Depressed people get sick, too; How stigma in the medical community made me sicker I’ve often found myself in a chicken and egg situation with my doctors when it comes to depression.   When I say I’m sick, they are too quick to assume the depression is the cause of my pain and not the other way around. After five minutes listening to me breathe, looking into my throat, and and touching the outside of my neck, they are stumped so it must be mental illness. It got the the point that when I was having severe abdominal pain, I didn’t go to the hospital. I had to push for any kind of testing, which took forever. When I finally found a doctor who listened to me, she told me I should have gone to the ER. Then I was depressed about that; I had let the other doctors make me doubt my own sanity.  Turns out, I’ve been pretty sick and needed surgery. Nearly all of the issues they blamed on depression were due to a chronic, painful illness with no cure. It’s bittersweet, I’ve solved a big piece of the puzzle for sure. But I’m still struggling a lot.  I just found out that I may be infertile. After my doctor said having a baby could help my condition. So that was depressing too. (I don’t think my depression caused my infertility. Checkmate, doctors!)  I did start seeing a psychiatrist, and he is a kind man. He diagnosed me with depression and anxiety. He has never suggested that my depression is the cause of my physical problems, and he seems to be sympathetic to me as a chronic pain patient. He’s given me depression medication, but I don’t know how much it’s helping. Chronic illness is a thing that happens to people and it’s just *depressing*. I’ve always had depression, but this just makes it worse. He has never dismissed me for feeling that way or written off my pain as being in my head.  Just wanted to share my experience with others who might understand. People with depression can experience health issues and get dismissed so easily. It took me years and years to get anywhere. It’s a struggle to cope with both mental and physical illness. Here’s to getting through today, friends.

Often disturbed by the sight of have found themselves intimately, I strived to obtain a personal connection of my own. Because of the envy that consumed me at the time, I rushed blindlessly into the raging sea of affection. Not knowing the consequences it would have. And so it has engulfed me in its massive whirlpools of chance. Eventually, it drowned me in great depression as each opportunity failed.  I was lost, confused, and even desperate. But soon I’ve found out the irrepressible truth… that nobody could ever learn to love someone as hideous as me.

"I finally came out to my close friends that I have depression, and now I'm being alienated because I'm ""not mentally stable"" Probably a rant, but what the fuck.  This last college semester was horrible on me, and I came out of it with depression and depression meds. I'm 19M in college right now. I thought it was pretty obvious, but I wanted to tell my friends about why I've been talking less and have been hermitting myself out a little.

Basically just some ""oh, ok..."" Like really? But it get's better.   So the night after I tell them, I get a message from one of my ""friends"", whom I was going to room with next year. The message said, and I can quote, that they ""don't feel safe around a mentally dark person"" in their house. Ok, what? Even better, the convo goes on and says that my group of friends were talking... And they don't want to, in quotes again, ""Associate with a mentally dark person"" as a friend. Like what the fuck? It's been a week and they've lived up to it. Suddenly I'm not getting invited anywhere or anything. If I'm with my friends (I still try to hang out), I'll get heavily ignored. Like what the fuck, my depression has now gotten so much worse.   I want to ditch every single one of them, but I honestly don't have any other close friends outside of this group. I'm trying my best to find new friends, and if that happens, I 'll happily leave these people who consider depression sufferers ""dark and unstable and unsafe"". Just needed to rant  Edit: Also thank you for all the hug PMs they really do help ;-;  Edit 2: Wow this blew up, in my point of view anyways. I'm going to talk to them, and cut out whoever is still toxic about it.

"Tomorrow the world will go on like always I've never been here... this wasn't a part of ""the plan"" but I said why not leave something somewhere since no one else will be receiving anything. I have lived 20 years by myself, no relationships, no close friends, and the memories of being taken advantage of in my youth haunt me day in and day out. I run away through drugs but my depression is beginning to break through my facade of confidence. No one knows who I am and even if presented with a companion I don't know if I could ever explain the scars. I hate who I am and how I act, I feel though it's not even me. Social anxiety makes me act in ways I can't even understand and the repetition of ""I'm okay"" is getting old. I've tried to make friends but no one seems to want to know me and it's left me feeling like a sociopath. Insanity overcomes me as I scream, clenching a blade that can no longer quiet my mind. I've tried so hard to not be ignorant or selfish but I can't handle this anymore. The need of hospitalizations and psychologists remind me of the freak I am. I strive for perfection but am the opposite of it. I have so much love that I want to express but have no place to put it. I was raised religious but have so many doubts, my problem maybe isn't ignorance but overthinking, I hope... Nobody seems to understand subjectivity/relativity. There is much to be said but this will probably find its own void. I'm dreaming of a different world, but the oblivion of what I don't know plagues me. I leave my love and peace here, may you find yours.

My brother has an attraction to me which really creeps me out. He's all the time running around the house naked, hitting on me, 'helping' me adjust my dresses so his hands can slide dangerously near my chest. It really, really disturbs me. My problem is that he asked me if it was all right if he hung around naked and stuff when I was drunk. I told him yes because I didn't have my mind about me. Now I can't think of how to tell him that it makes me uncomfortable and that I don't want him doing it anymore.  Along with that I just lost my best friend due to depression. I've been trapped in my house for two weeks and I haven't seen my mom, dad, brother, or sister for more than five minutes in this entire time.  I just want to run away from it all. I don't want to kill myself, but I do want to pack and go and just get away from this wretched town. Would it be such a bad thing to leave?

" I'm sitting in a wading pool in Paul's backyard on a sweltering 100 degree day in Portland. Tomorrow I leave for the San Juan islands on a two week trip with 12-14 year olds. I am savoring every moment of relaxation I have in my thirty-six hours off, though it is always difficult to resist the call of the lengthening to-do list.  In college Cynthia and I were going to make a think tank called Brains in a Vat. We would lie around thinking and writing and solve the world's problems. Right now I don't feel like I have very many solutions to the world's problems, but if I could sit around all day and think I would surely come up with something phenomenal. The blogger address brainsinavat.blogspot was taken, which makes me wonder if someone else is usurping our idea. I had to take Brains in a Jar. Too bad. What will I do if they are conservative assholes using ""Brains in a  Vat""? Closed-minded, tightass brains in a vat. I bet their logo isn't as nice as ours. I can see it now: Brains in a Jar versus Brains in a Vat. Two thinktanks battling head to head for funding. I guess if they can solve the world's problems before we can, I should commend them.  Thirty-seven days left of my job. My mom suggeested that I count them down on my calendar to make the time seem more manageable. Thirty-seven days seems very far from manageable right now. I know I can do it and I know that I am helping them out by giving so much advanced notice, but some days I kick myself for not just giving two weeks notice like everyone else in America.

"Apologizing to a family member ? Not sure if this is the right place to put this?  If it’s not feel free to direct me!  To sum it up,  I’ve highly offended a family member of mine.  I wrote this apology that I can’t bring myself to send them.  I kept telling them how much I wanted to see them and I even flew up to see everyone.  When we were all seated at a restaurant I was having really bad anxiety and didn’t really speak to anyone.  He took this really personal and felt I came off as an asshole.  I didn’t know how to explain the anxiety part of things to him so I gave him a lame excuse about eating spoiled food the night before.  While it was true it wasn’t the reason I wasn’t speaking to anyone.  Then I had went to his house to try and speak to him as I was leaving the next day and he told me not to come.  I did anyway and you can imagine that didn’t end well at all.  He won’t talk to me.  I finally found the courage to type up this apology.  It explains the conditions I suffer from, how they’re debilitating and the trauma I endured that caused them.  The apology I feel is oversharing but I also wanted to explain myself in full and be as genuine as I possibly can.   Nobody knows the things I went through but I’m going to post the apology here for you guys to read for yourselves.  Please don’t judge me too harshly I just don’t want this family member to never talk to me again.   I understand it may come off as a pity me type of thing but I promise it’s not.    Here it is :   I just wanted to let you how sorry I am.  I should’ve apologized sooner but I wanted to give you time.  I’d like to fully explain myself.  This is really long but it’s genuine.  And I’m not justifying myself in any way as I fully understand that I’ve crossed boundaries and disrespected you but I also want you to have a better understanding of what really happened.  Hear me out before you roll your eyes at what I’m about to say.   Some of this won’t make any sense initially.  But trust me it all ties together.  Whatever decision you make I’d prefer for you not to tell anyone any of this stuff.  This is why I handled certain things the way I did.  I’ve been through a lot of trauma.  Initially it was with Savannah’s dad.  He would beat me, kick me, slap, choke, etc told me my mother would be happy with me gone.  And she was aware and didn’t do anything.  This was when Jody had custody of me but I was visiting them when they had an apartment together.  Eventually I went to live with my dad and his parents.  His mom didn’t want any more kids and she was absolutely terrible to me.  She’d give me Valium to sedate me, swing pots and pans at me, threaten me with knives, lock me out of the house etc.  My dad wasn’t any better as he gave me my first black eye.  School was really difficult as I’d get bullied pretty bad and I’d get myself suspended just to avoid it.  At this point people claimed I had a behavioral issue and I was put on multiple medications I didn’t need.  His mom was able to collect SSI because of this and when Jody found this out she wanted me back.  After a year back and forth to court she won custody in January 2014.  I was 15 at this point.  She promised me a better life but it only got worse.  She kept me locked up in the house for 4 years as she didn’t want me improving and losing the SSI.  Her boyfriend also lived there, he was an alcoholic.  He’d break into my room in the middle of the night to beat and rape me.  Taunt me about how I’ve made previous suicide attempts and would go on about how he’d kill me but he figured I’d do it myself anyway.  I’ve never told anyone as I figured nobody would ever believe me.  Anyway, I was diagnosed with depression, PTSD, Panic Disorder, and social anxiety, and yet most people aren’t aware of a lot of the things I’m telling you right now.  Because of some of these conditions it’s hard for me to socialize with people for the first time.  I wasn’t trying to be distant or cold to you in person but my anxiety makes me seem that way and I’m sorry.  It’s something I’m trying to work on.  In fact it was so bad at one point I wasn’t even able to eat in a restaurant.  I couldn’t open the door if I ordered food.  I was constantly living in fear of being injured, killed, judged, any situation I was faced with I’d think of the worst possible scenario.  It’s even preventing me from getting a license.  Now, when you said I was chatty in text and not in person it really hurt my feelings and I wanted to explain but how do I explain this to somebody?  If I just said oh I have anxiety I felt as if it would’ve sounded like bs.  And I just felt absolutely terrible and I acted on an impulse and I just ended up disrespecting you and crossed boundaries I never should’ve in the first place and I am so so sorry for that.  Some of the things Aunt Connie said to me I took it to heart when I shouldn’t have and it was another contributing factor as to why I had left.  The spoiled meat story was true it wasn’t a lie.  I ate it around 1 in the morning she didn’t give it to me I wasn’t implying she did.  But it wasn’t what made me not say much.  If you were wondering why I had my luggage it’s because I figured you’d be mad,  but let me in.  I didn’t have enough money to uber all the way back so that’s why I brought my stuff.  It was idiotic I know.  I’m sorry.  Also,  I realize I’ve done things prior to this that have annoyed you.  And if I could get another chance I promise I won’t do those things again.   Sorry for those things as well.  I understand if you find it strange for me to tell you all of this but I’m sick of people not understanding how hard it is to deal with anxiety.  I wish I could do what normal people do without having racing thoughts and feeling like I’m about to pass out or worry about what people think of me or feel they’re laughing at me.  I wish I was normal but I’m not.  There isn’t an off switch.  Granted they don’t know all of this but now that you do I hope you believe me when I say it’s not an excuse.  If you have any questions about this stuff or anything in general you can ask I just hope you’re not mad at me anymore.  And maybe if possible I could come up again in a few months and try again ?  I know I gave a really bad first impression and it’s hard to shake that but I’d like to try and fix that as well.  Plus I never really got to know you all that well like I did with Aunt Connie and Uncle Paul.   And she basically told me I’m never welcome there again because I left.  I mean we texted but you get what I’m saying right ?  This is long and now I’m rambling sorry but I feel so much better now that I’ve said all this it was bothering me.  I just don’t have too many people in life right now.  And I know even when I first started talking to you on Facebook I would you send you pictures of alcohol and talk about drugs and I want to briefly go into that.  I was never hooked on anything hard.  I watched my mom lose everything from her health to her kids.  I did smoke weed, cigs, drink, and xannies.   I lived with an older cousin who pressured me but at the same time it was a way to escape my pain.   It wasn’t easy watching my mom nod out and Aunt abuse my brothers and sisters and only keep them for money.   And being stuck in that house everyday and dealing with an alcoholic.   I was never necessarily hooked on anything besides cigarettes but I didn’t want to look 40 by 30 so I quit those too.  It overall made my mental health even worse.   I finally cut all of that out and that’s when I heavily turned to food.  Then I gained almost 100 lbs and that was another reason I didn’t wanna talk to anyone because I felt absolutely disgusting but I’ve lost most of it now!  I’m back down to 180.  12 pounds until I’m a healthy weight.  But my point is I’m not that kid anymore I promise you.  I wasn’t even when I went up there there’s just more to everything than you initially see ya know?  And I’m not my mom I would never ask you for a dime.  I promise you I’m not a bad person if you really get to know me.  I’ve just had a lot of things I had to go through and I feel pretty much broken as a person but I’m trying to put myself back together it’s really difficult but I don’t have any choice but to go forward.  Believe me I still want to end it sometimes but I somehow manage to keep pushing on every day.   Talking to you, and Aunt Connie, and Uncle Paul made me feel like I had a chance of having some decent family members you know?  And I don’t really know you all that well to say how you are as a person but you seemed really nice.  And then I screwed it up with everyone.  It just made me feel like I’d finally have what I always wanted and I should’ve been realistic as I didn’t grow up with you guys, none of you know me like that, and I should’ve kept myself in line.  I just hope that you’d be willing to give me a second chance.  Again, I genuinely am sorry for all the unnecessary drama I’ve brought into your life.   But, I’m really lonely and I’d love to have some family that doesn’t hurt me.  I tried to explain the anxiety to Aunt Connie but she didn’t get it.  She thought I was just being rude whenever there was company or I was at her brothers house.  Of course I didn’t tell her everything I told you because I didn’t feel comfortable.  And it’s still uncomfortable telling you all of this but I felt that I owed you a proper explanation.  I mean I kept talking about how I wanted to see you and then didn’t even speak to you in person how much of an asshole I probably came off as.

"Friends keep making fun of me? Firstly, I'm 18 and attending high school right now.Recently, my parents got us a dog, and we named it Carly. I freaking loved her, but after reviewing some medical expenses we would have to pay, we had to give her back to her shelter after only a month or so of having her. I was heartbroken.  I came back to school on Monday this week and told my friends. Now in my friend group of three, there is one guy who loves to make fun of us. One of my friends is fat so he makes fun of his weight. I'm gay and he makes fun of me for being a faggot. My other friend does weed and he makes fun of him for being a drug junkie.  But I think he crossed the line this time. He made fun of me by saying ""you killed your dog"" and all he's been doing this week has been calling me a ""dog killer"" and telling everyone that I am one. The annoying part is my best friend in the group is tagging along with this joke and they both think it's okay to make fun of me for this.  I'm kind of embarrassed to say this, but I'm a very emotional person and I suffer from depression so it's hard for me to deal with this kind of stuff. Today when they started making fun of me again for being a ""dog killer"" I left and hid in the bathroom cause I just wanted to cry and I did. I hate it when people are mean to each other and it really hurts when someone does it to me. That, and the fact I was really sad about Carly leaving me makes me just not want to talk to them anymore. But the problem is those guys are the only friends I really have (Trust me, they remind me I'd have no friends if they weren't so nice to be my friend).  I really don't know what to do. I miss my dog, I've been really depressed as of recently, and my friends are making fun of me. What should I do about my friends, honestly?

"When did you decide to get help? What was the tipping point? I’m been having thoughts and feelings lately and I want to compare them to when other people decided to take the plunge. There are days when I’m happy but most nights and some days are not as good. Recently I’ve been struggling and I try to remind myself that it’s not so bad and I could have it worse etc. But anyway. I don’t want to go into a lot of detail or get really personal but for context I’m a college senior. I went to a psychiatrist when I was young (like 7 or 8) and I took medicine for depression but they made me aggressive according to my mom so I didn’t take them long. I haven’t seen anyone, including a school counselor, since then. However in late high school/early college I struggled with self harm. These days I just feel so tired and empty and I just want to sleep.

" This is my first attempt at keeping any sort of journal. I have never been very good at keeping any sort of record of my life. I have always had the fear that once an experience is put on paper, the brain no longer has a need to remember it and the memory is thus discarded, or rerouted for use in another way. Therefore, I am rather skeptical to put much of note down here too soon. Perhaps my mind ramblings will be just that, ramblings, nothing more, nothing less. Or, perhaps, I will learn that the more I jot down, the more I will be able to remember. The brain never ceases to amaze me. It remembers things long since forgotten, in a way...Perhaps that is where DeJaVue comes from. I am constantly in a state of rememberance, that is the way that I know I am on the right track in life. Whenever I don't get a memory of something that I am doing that I know I have never done before, I know that what I am doing is that which I am supossed to be doing. My life, otherwise, might get very complicated and then where would I be?  A friend from my childhood has had a very trying life and started blogging to sort things out. I am very proud of her for that. She is who made me decide to try it. I don't really have an outlet for my life, my husband has a hard time understanding my need for higher and higher education. That is not to say that he is not supportive or encouraging by any means, it is just that he felt a Bachelors degree was all that was really needed. I, on the other hand, feel that I need to get more. I am in the process of completing my BA in Molecular Biology and a minor in Chemistry, only to persue a DVM/PhD combo in the next 6yrs.  Perhaps I will obtain that goal, but for now I am just looking forward to finally obtaining my first degree...and it has only me since 1996...3 years sabatical for work and my son...etc, basically life in general...

"Is My Friend A Bad Friend? I have a friend. When I moved to a foreign country, I went to a school and met this friend. We have been quite close but after I moved back to my country, we’ve only been communicating through texts. She has been a helpful friend but I don’t know if she is a good friend or a bad friend.   There were many occasions when I wondered if I should break friends with her, but I always told myself that she didn’t mean to ever hurt me and I kept on trying my best to act like nothing was wrong and acted friendly. But I srsly can’t hold it in and I wanna know if I’m just being sensitive..   These are some of the things she does that makes me wonder if we should break friends..  1.We use eachother’s selfies as our profile pics and I always use the best selfies of hers or at least what I think are the best looking ones. And I sent her a video if me singing with my other friend and she took a screenshot in the middle of the video and used it as her profile pic and My mouth was wide open and my eyes were scrunched up and it really looked horrible and when I asked her to change it, she asked what I meant and that it didnt look bad.   Sure she couldve been being nice and I could’ve been acting emotional but I really didn’t like other people who I didn’t even know seeing a photo like this so I pleaded her to change it but I tried to keep the joking and friendly mood. However then she said “Funny. U wouldn’t wanna see the other screenshot I took.” And we both didn’t say anything. And she didn’t change it.   2.The way she texts me depends on her mood. If she isn’t feeling friendly, she barely answers my texts and replies with short answers and doesn’t laugh at anything funny I have to say.   I wondered if I could also be acting like that at times but I looked back at our conversations and ai never let my mood change the way I replied to her, and I honestly didn’t even speak in an unfriendly way when she said something rude to me or something that made me feel offended.  3.She doesn’t act like she cares for what I have to say. Whenever something bad happens to me and I tell her, she just gives a small reaction and talks about something else.  4.She ignores my texts. There was once a time when she saw my texts and didnt reply. I asked why she didn’t reply and she saw it but ignored it. I thought that maybe she had something important going on so I just kept on texting her every few hours like nothing was wrong cuz I don’t exactly like showing others when I feel hurt.   She read my texts and ignored me for two whole days and finally texted me back as if nothing had happened. She didn’t apologize for not replying nor did she give an explanation. She just texted me about something else she wanted to say. There were lots of cases like this.  5.She acts like she has the worst life. I go through alot of stress each day cuz I have had family troubles and sometimes had been bullied. I have also often had suicidal thoughts.   However whenever I tell her about things that are stressing me out, she points out that her life is worse. I understand that she has her own troubles but I really dont like the way she underestimates my life and doesn’t care for it.  6.She once cyber bullied me. When I left her school and left the country, we had a small fight and she told her friends about the bad things I had once said, not mentioning her faults. She then invited me to a group chat with lots of people and they all fought against me, calling me fat,ugly,short,stupid,and dumb. They also made racial comments and insulted my mom.   After a year passed, I texted her. I can’t believe I did it, but I said that I WAS SORRY. And she said that she forgave me and now we’re talking like friends again.   But whenever I bring up a little detail from the past, she gets mad and says that I am blaming her for the past and makes me feel guilty for something I shouldn’t be guilty about.  7.She thinks that she is perfectly innocent. I’m not saying shes a totally horrible person, she can be a good friend at times, but I gotta admit that at times she can be horrid..  And whenever something bad happens to her, she says that she doesn’t get what she did to deserve it and that she is getting mistreated.   If you think about it that way, I feel like I also deserve this, considering Im not a saint or an angel. But whenever my friend says that she didnt do anything bad to deserve some bad things that happened to her, I can’t help but feel disappointed at the fact that she doesn’t realize  how much she hurted me  What should I do..?

"I made a word cloud of all my depressive posts over the past three years. https://i.imgur.com/hNbtyW4.png    This is based on all the posts on my throwaway account (this is my main account and has too many unrelated posts to sort through) since 2014.    I think it's noteworthy that some of the biggest words in the cloud are negative.    While going back over these posts from so relatively long ago, I noticed that most of the older ones seemed like they were written by a total stranger. If it were somebody else saying those things about me, it would be called harassment, but it was me saying those things about myself.  All in all, this has really made me realize that all the things I have written about myself are way off-base, and are only true in my mind during a depressive episode.    I know something's wrong, but I don't know what to do about it. In some ways I'm sure I'll always think this way about myself, regardless of what I do, but I wish there were an easy way to manage it.

"Is my friend a narcisist? I have this ""friend"" who I find kinda annoying. Because of my not so social nature I am used to being the third wheel, but this person, let's call him ""Eric"", seems to have me as an option.  Now, we met each other due to a drama club where I managed to get myself into a script writing role, he wanted in. Me being an innocent 11 year old at the time, I didn't think much of it.  Now, 17, here are a few factors that lead me to believe the title:  1) I dont care about what other people think of me. Whenever he can he always speaks to his other friends, let's call him ""Mark,""  Mark doesn't like conflict and therefore listens to everyone. I am his secondary option.   2) Whenever I do better than him at something he always tries to make himself seem better and that I just got lucky.  He says things like:  ""You just used 10 more minutes, so you did worse""  ""You always get lower or equal to the mark I get.""  3) he tries to get me to adapt to him by saying things like:  ""Did you really choose that haircut? Its bad""  Or  ""I am dissapointed in you""  And  ""We're soul-friends"" (trying to make me agree with him)   4) He is always butting into conversations with my other friends, trying to pull me away from them  5) He tries to convince me that I'll do better at life with him rather than anyone else.   Again, I don't take any of this to heart and generally just ignore him, but should I make it clear that I know what hes doing, or am I just being paranoid?

"Friend Abandonment Issues Hey Reddit. Im having some friend issues. I(M33) have a friend(M34) who I was close with for years who now seems to abandoning me. We met each other 10 years ago. We hit it off and would casually hang out with eachother. He was new to the city so I ushered him into the fold of my friend group.We both had similar tastes and sense of humor. It would work out good and we would have a great time. After a couple years he totally cut off contact with me and those friends. I was confused but didn't mind so much then because I wasn't super close with him. I was confused but not hurt. A couple years after that I reached out to a bunch of people because I needed help moving. I was pretty desperate and couldn't afford movers so I reached out to him as well. To my surprise he responded and came and helped. I was so happy he offered to help and was happy to see him again. After that, we started hanging out again. I asked him what happened and why he broke off contact and he shared with me things about being depressed and hanging out with other people. It felt I little strange but I accepted it and carried on being his friend again. We both moved to a 'big city' through our jobs and work and would meet lots of different people and introduce each other to new friends. We would periodically check in with each other and see how each other are doing, even if we couldn't hang out for weeks on end. We were in a band for a while, threw parties and events. We both went through break ups with our long time partners at different times, and helped each other out in that regard. We basically became 'close friends' and expressed this to each other. Then I introduced him to a group of old friends of mine who recently moved into the city. They all began to hang out with him and it was all good. He even hooked up with one of those friends and have been together for years. I too found a partner I have been with for a a couple years now. Now, over the past couple years he has began to hang out with all of those friends and much less of me. He hardly ever reaches out to catch up or hang out. Months will go by. I try to reach out and stay in touch with him but he does not reciprocate. I had been dealing with this over the past couple years now. I finally called him that I feel a little hurt and that it feels like he doesn't reach out or try to stay in touch- or care for that matter. His response is ""I'm just too busy"" sort of answer. I can also see on social media that he does hang out with other people- mostly the friends I've introduced him to. I feel really hurt by this. I don't understand why he all the sudden doesn't seem to care about me. I don't feel like I have any good friends I can go to anymore. Other close friends have done the same. I have had other friends that I became pretty close with who later I feel like started to treat me like they were 'too cool' to hang out with me anymore. I start to feel less respected and cared about. I'll ask them about things they're doing in their lives and won't be asked the same questions in return. When I do put forward information about things is my life I feel like they're less and less taken seriously or completely indifferent to it. Here's the other thing that confuses me: Some of these friends years later come out of the blue- if I run into them or they start commenting a ton on fb post and act like nothing happened and sometimes they are eager to hang out again. It makes me feel like all the sudden I've done something cool enough, or are hanging out with people they are interested in and want to join in. I don't know whether to ignore them or try to let things go and be friends. My fear is that if I do, we may become close again and they will just do the same thing. Im very confused why this happens. I don't know if I'm doing something to encourage this. When I say 'close friend' I do not mean calling every day or even every week and sharing every aspect of each other lives. Close friend just means some one you can talk to every once in a while, and who checks in to see how the other is doing. Is that asking for too much? I feel envious when I see how my girlfriend has couple good friends she talks to about her life and issues. I think it's healthy to have close friends other than your significant other you can do this with, I just don't understand why I can't hold close friends. Any advice would be welcomed. As a side note: since this has happened with my 'close friend' I have tried to widen my net and reach out to other people to hang out. I am becoming extremely exhausted. At age 33 now, I feel it is so difficult to try to hang out with other people. I feel like I do all the reaching out and it's making me feel extremely bitter about friends and relationships. I understand about casual friends, networking, or friends that are united around similar interests. I just get frustrated when that is the only thing that holds people together. I wonder- is that a symptom of living in a big city where everyone is trying to 'make it?' I think that, but then I'll hear about how some other casual friends keep in touch with each other still and give each other life advice etc. and just feel frustrated that I can't keep consistent good friends like that.

"All of my friends annoy me I try to hang out with ‘close friends’ because I know it’s meant to be good for me. There’s probably about 4-5 people I’m close to. These are all good people who I’ve known for years, who I can be honest with about my emotions and mental health, who genuinely do care about me. On paper they’re amazing. And they are.  Only I find that whenever I spend time with a friend, they end up annoying the shit out of me. Each one for a different reason. One talks about herself too much, one is too positive and gushy, one only ever talks about the past, the other only wants to hang out and drink. When I’m with them, I just find myself wishing I could be alone.  I know the problem is with me, and that I’m sabotaging my relationships (as I always do and have done for many years). I feel guilty about it, especially knowing that I’m lucky to even have friends. But the truth is, I find people exhausting, and whenever I’m with them I just feel lonelier that when I’m alone. I end up getting snappy. It’s like I’m watching myself destroy my relationships but I don’t know how to stop. Hanging out with people makes me unhappy.

"I'm going to start with the apology. To all my friends here, and everyone is, whether you've read anything I've written or not, I am so sorry that I have not been able to offer you support. I get into your threads, and the words just don't come. Sometimes the best I can do is just a hi, I was here. I'll start the explanation, but this thread may take me a week or so to finish, as I hate long posts, and it's so much effort to try and find the words. I am in major trouble at work. I'm to blame, although someone I thought was a friend, complained about me - I don't do enough work, don't work fast enough, and do not work efficiently or accurately enough, and she complained to the right person. Let's get out of chronological order. Due to weird circumstances, I went for about 3 months without medicines, and therapy. In November, I was at the bottom of a deep, dark pit, so called my psychiatrist, Barry. Surprising for me, I went back with a new, improved attitude. We'd had a couple of productive sessions when annual reviews came out. I called him for advice, and thought that while the advice he offered was good, that he was not being supportive at all. I actually thought about how to discuss with him how his response made me feel, rather than just shut him out. We had a couple of excellent sessions, which apparently told him that something had triggered defensive coping skills, and where my mind actually was. Can't write anymore tonight, other than, Scarlet, hang in there, you're in for the ride of your life. You truly are going to be a fabulous mother, trust me.

"I'm new here - wasn't quite sure where to start but ""special new member posting area"" seemed appropriate. I think I've been battling depression off and on for some time now. I saw a therapist briefly, for a couple months, but had to stop when it got too expensive and when I couldn't take the time off work anymore. I actually didn't even start seeing her until the worst of my depression had already passed. Not sure I got that much out of it, but maybe I didn't give it enough time. I was doing so well for a while, but in the last week or two, I can feel myself sliding back into it. There are certain things, issues, that tend to pull me into that hole. I'd done so well at avoiding them, I felt like I was over it. But I'm dwelling on them again, and I don't know what to do this time to break the hold. The smallest thing sets me off crying, and I've completely lost interest in the things I was so excited about two weeks ago, along with most everything else. I feel completely isolated - I have no one to talk to about this, which I guess is why I'm here online. OK not sure what the point of this post was, but thanks for letting me get it out. Sometimes it feels better just to tell someone, anyone.",1,new not quite sure start special new member posting area appropriate think battling depression time now saw therapist briefly couple month stop got expensive not time work anymore actually did not start seeing worst depression passed not sure got it maybe did not time doing while week two feel sliding it certain thing issue tend pull hole avoiding them felt like it dwelling again not know time break hold smallest thing set cry completely lost thing excited week ago else feel completely isolated talk this guess online ok not sure point post wa thanks letting out feel better just tell someone anyone

"Lonely and stupid. I feel so stupid.   I've always been academic and studious- if anything, I've dedicated my existence to the pursuit of knowledge, at the expense of forming human relationships. But I'm constantly overwhelmed by how much I don't know, how slow I am to understand concepts, and how my peers are all more intelligent than me. I know it's impossible to always be the smartest person in the room, but I feel that the fruits of my studies are disproportionate to my efforts.   At the same time, I have conflicting feelings over my loneliness. I desire human interaction, but others find me rigid and distant. In all honesty, I'm easily bored by small talk and trivial discussions. I understand that it's important in forming friendships, but my under-stimulated brain seems to automatically 'shut-off' after a while.   I've noticed that the people I do get along with are like me. Introverted, cold, and academic. We do not see each other as people, but as enlightened books with fresh concepts. These ideas are interesting to explore. If the book is lost, we are disappointed but not crushed. We were never bound by friendship; we were tied by our interests and perhaps mutual isolation. I don't feel an ounce of human warmth from these acquaintances.

" I started talkin to this awesome guy I had met on  plentyofish.com about  two weeks ago we would talk every night for at least 5 hours a night.  He seemed to be everything I wanted in a man and he had made  me believe that I was everything he wanted in a woman, we had shared pictures a lot of pictures so he new what I looked like and I new what he looked like, well this guy was just to good to be true just a wonderful man he would tell me he loved me and how he wanted a future with me. He decided that he had to come see me so after two weeks of talkin and getting to know eachother through conversation  he shows up on my door step at around 1 am on Saturday morning. I aswered the door and he was just as beautiful as his pictures but I could tell I wasn't everything he imagined id be. I still had a day and a half with this guy and I new he didn't like me the way he said he did because of the way I looked can you imagine the heartache of rejection when its slapped in your face?Well he ended up staying the whole time and we had a nice time, we took my girls to see a movie and he came to my mothers house for dinner and what not! We did sleep together but I feel like he did it out of pity for me. It just hurts to be rejected by someone who tells you they love you and how beautiful you are,I told him how scared I was to meet him cause I didn't want to disappoint him but he said ""what do you think I'm a shallow person? I think your beautiful and I want to be with you"". So now here I am 2 days later not one phone call from him and a broken heart to deal with!

"I'm sort of new... Here is the short version: I'm 26 year old man. Single. No kids. I live in Arizona (USA). My father was a workaholic, and an alcoholic. So usually he wasn't present, and when he was he was abusive. In addition, mental illness runs in my family. At the age of 5 I was sexually molested by a neighbor. I can recall my anxiety always being there. It's something I have always fought with especially in social situations. My family completely isolated me when I was growing up, in the name of protecting me. As a result I never really learned social skills until I was older. I grew up being abused by my peers throughout school. Found myself taken in by the only people who would accept me as I was: the misfits, outcasts, drug-users. Early into my teen years depression came as an addition to my anxiety. Around 16 I started to get into substance abuse. The only thing I ever used was LSD on weekends regularly. A year later this extended into ecstasy and LSD. I had a traumatic experience and stopped using anything about a year after that. My anxiety became so overwhelming I could not function. So at this time I first started seeing a counselor and a psychiatrist. They put me on Clonzepam. My last year in high school my father was starting to lose it so my mother asked me to leave so we didn't kill each other. I had an inheritance from another relative and I lived off that. I went 2 whole years without speaking to my father. I sunk deep into depression, and returned to substance abuse. The Clonzepam wasn't working anymore. After being outcast from my family, I went full on into the dark side. What was just LSD and ecstasy usage branched into cocaine, meth, marijuana, and virtually anything my friends and I could find. This culminated in an extreme suicide attempt about a year out of high school. After getting out of the mental hospital, I went totally straight and haven't touched any drugs since then. The 8 years following have been a rollercoaster. One moment being on top of the world, having everything I could ever want. Another losing everything. Several long horrible relationships occurred in this time. Over the years my doctor has moved me around on various medicines. I have been using Effexor since 1998. Currenlty I take Lamictal in addition to it. I suffer from chronic reoccurring depression, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder.",1,sort new short version year old man single kid live arizona usa father workaholic alcoholic usually not present abusive addition mental illness run family age sexually molested neighbor recall anxiety there fought especially social situation family completely isolated growing up protecting me result really learned social skill older grew abused peer school taken people accept wa misfit outcast drugusers early teen year depression came addition anxiety started substance abuse thing used lsd weekend regularly year later extended ecstasy lsd traumatic experience stopped using year that anxiety overwhelming not function time started seeing counselor psychiatrist clonzepam year high school father starting lose mother asked leave did not kill other inheritance relative lived that went year speaking father sunk deep depression returned substance abuse clonzepam not working anymore outcast family went dark side just lsd ecstasy usage branched cocaine meth marijuana virtually friend find culminated extreme suicide attempt year high school getting mental hospital went totally straight not touched drug then year following rollercoaster moment world having want losing everything long horrible relationship occurred time year doctor moved various medicine using effexor currenlty lamictal addition it suffer chronic reoccurring depression social phobia generalized anxiety disorder

"NOTES FOR A SUCCESSFUL EFFEXOR WITHDRAWAL  After doing research on this board and others, I prepared the following withdrawal regime and carried it out, making slight adjustments as I went along.  It worked for me, although the withdrawal was not easy.  I share it with you all in gratitude for all your advice and sharing over these past months. I hope it will be a help for you preparing to come off Effexor  1. MY SITUATION:  a. Length of Time of Effexor: 5.5 years  b. Dosage: 150 mg XR  c. Reason for Effexor: TMJ, myofascia and migraines due to a displaced jaw disc, lock jaw and stress.  d. Other medications: Flexeril (periodically over the years but not in past year when things are ""bad""); Trazodone, for sleep; vitamins and herbs as needed.  e. Status: Age: 43, Height 5'-10""; Weight: 160. Married, no kids, work from home.  f. Reasons to Come Off: Generally feeling better with the help of physiotherapist; life situation has become low-stress and stabile (secure job, good marriage, work from home); side effects of Effexor becoming irritating, especially the emotional distance from my own thoughts / emotions; and simply feel that I cannot be on this drug for the rest of my life.  2. MY WITHDRAWAL REGIME  Procedure:  Drop my dosage by 18.75 mg (XR) every two weeks. 4 months total time to get to zero. Divided 37mg pills into two parts to equal 18.75, depositing each part in new empty vegetable gel caps (available at health food store).  In general:  a. No caffeine -- not even decaffeinated coffee.  b. No alcohol.  c. Exercise every day (heartbeat up for 20 minutes or more).  d. Steam Room / Sauna / Hot bath or long hot shower every day.  e. 40-50 hour work weeks, nights / weekends off for ""down time"".  Daily:  a. Vitamins (one dosage each in the morning and night): B Complex (50 mg); C (1000  mg); E (400 iu); Omega (2000 mg); Glucosamine Sulfate; 8 glasses of water.  b. Continued with my Trazodone medication for sleep during entire tapering process, took no Flexeril.  Experience during each tapering of 18.75 mg:  First 24 hours: no side effects.  48 hours: very bad day: grumpy, anger, rage (for someone relatively sweet natured); nausea, dizzy, balance problems, headache; when moving head too quickly would become nauseous; body pains, disrupted sleep with periodic nightmares. The main thing is to be as far from other people as possible since any conversation would rub me the wrong way. Asked wife to take nothing I say personally, agree with whatever I say, or simply ""get out of my way"". Eventually we found sending her away for the day shopping or whatever to be the best. On these days I would plan to do a lot of non - thinking busy work around the house: fix things, garden, etc. Spent extra time at gym and in steam room.  72 hours: very low energy, dopey, foggy, wanting to stay in bed, body pains. My energy would then slowly gain over the next few days. Some of the above side effects would appear briefly without warning between drops in dosage (anger, bad nights sleep, sluggish).  Once at zero mg.:  Symptoms:  All of the above, but slightly increased in all areas.  Acute allergy symptoms -- sneezing, headache, stuffed up from morning to night -- aches and pains. I took Benadryl during this time which helped a lot.  Detox Period:  Now I had to remove the toxins from Effexor from my body. Regime:  a. Steam Room / Sauna / Hot bath or long hot shower twice every day--with cold shower breaks in between heat sessions to mimic the aspects of fever.  b. cleanser: Triphila and Psyllium husk powder twice a day  c. Dry brush my skin (the skin holds a 1/3 of the body's toxins)  d. 5 day juice fast, with 2 days before and after of raw vegetables/fruits only. Stopped all medications, vitamins, benadryl, colon cleanser, everything during this juice fast. I scheduled the fast approximately 2 weeks after stopping Effexor.  e. Exercise regime every day.  3. AM I NOW IN THE CLEAR?  Here I am 4 weeks after the end of Effexor (and Trazadone -- which I replaced with melatonin). I continue to take vitamins and will do so for quite a while. So ... How am I feeling?  - I don't have words to describe how wonderful it is to have my feelings, emotions and mind back, where I feel that my moods are my own and not manufactured by Effexor.  - Allergies continue to haunt me daily, but each day it gets a bit better, and I take less benadryl.  - No need to remember pill times is wonderful, less dry mouth.  - Still a bit ""low energy"", but it gets better each day.  - Mood is upbeat, feeling hopeful and looking forward to clear windshields everyday!  I hope this help those of you out there planning to come off this drug. I am grateful for Effexor for all it has done to help me over the years. I wished they warned me about the withdrawal. I am grateful for all your suggestions and comments that helped me research and put this regime into place. It worked for me and I probably wouldn't change a thing if I were to do it again.

"Doctor taking me off meds Cold Turkey Hi everyone, I've been on Prozac (Fluexetine) since 9th grade. I am a 2nd year student in college now. For the past few years I've been upped from 10mg, to 20mg, and now 40mg. I've been on 40 mg for 3 years. When I went to my doctor it was only to tell him during a check up that I was comfortable with my medicine and dosage, so he would send more prescriptions to my pharmacy.   During my last visit, I expected it to be a quick and simple check up as usual, but instead he said he was prescribing me ""3 more months"" of  40 mg Prozac then making me stop cold Turkey because ""being on Prozac for more than 6 months is bad"".   I don't understand because he has been constantly renewing my prescription for years and never said anything about tapering off or stopping. I once went a month cold turkey during a health insurance issue and around the 3rd week I had attempted suicide.   And addressing the ""3 months"" he promised, I was quickly informed the pharmacy was only given 1 month of medicine for me   I've been admitted to a mental hospital by my mother after I got raped and beaten, because I drank a lot of alcohol for a few days.  I've been to several therapists. I've been rationing my pills 1 every 2 days, and my mother and fiancée who I live with have already seen a drastic change in my behavior. I feel awful because they give me such a nice and comfortable life but I am still depressed. I don't know what to do when I have no more antidepressants after 5+ years and then going cold Turkey. I'm afraid my brain chemistry will convince me to do something stupid and damaging to myself again.",1,doctor taking med cold turkey hi everyone prozac fluexetine th grade nd year student college now past year upped mg mg mg mg year went doctor tell check comfortable medicine dosage send prescription pharmacy visit expected quick simple check usual instead said prescribing month mg prozac making stop cold turkey being prozac month bad not understand constantly renewing prescription year said tapering stopping went month cold turkey health insurance issue rd week attempted suicide addressing month promised quickly informed pharmacy given month medicine admitted mental hospital mother got raped beaten drank lot alcohol day therapist rationing pill day mother fiance live seen drastic change behavior feel awful nice comfortable life depressed not know antidepressant year going cold turkey afraid brain chemistry convince stupid damaging again

And (un)fortunately my husband is my best friend leaving me feeling alone with no one to talk to.  I have a 20month old and am 35 weeks pregnant. My husband for the last few weeks has been feeling nauseous and out of sorts. I finally convinced him to go to a redicare. Well those jerks turned him away since they can’t help with abdominal pain. I wasn’t with him or they would have seen him. He ended up going to another urgent care. There they realized he had a bp of 220/112. First annoyance if the first place took his vitals we could have headed straight to the ER. We met up and got him there right away. We were at the ER for several hours before they made the decision to admit him to the cardiac unit of the hospital. Since then they have discovered a kidney issue and have not gotten a handle on the bp.  They have no answers but seem to be coming up with more questions. He isn’t even 30 so the fact this is happening is extremely bizarre.   His mother was here to help, but I am at my wits end and needed to be alone this evening. We just moved our daughter to a toddler bed Saturday which is doing great at night but she hasn’t napped in 3 days. She is crabby and obviously confused since daddy isn’t home. She is also in a phase where hitting mommy is funny. She hit me today and I just burst into tears. Which according to my mil is my hormones which really helped the situation.  I can’t sleep and am vomiting from pregnancy and stress. I know I have to be strong for her and him and unborn, but I am failing. I spent 2 hours tonight just crying. I keep losing my temper with my daughter. I wish I could be at the hospital with him. I feel stranded, alone and useless. I don’t know how I can help him. He is spiraling down into a pit of depression and I have no way of helping him out. I keep calling and texting him which I can tell he doesn’t want.   We are going to visit tomorrow morning then my mom is going to come here tomorrow so I can go see him again without the little one. But I haven’t been home much the past 2 days and I know it is taking a toll on her. I just recently became a stay at home which has created separation anxiety issues. I feel torn between to 2 people who mean the world to me and I am failing both of them.   If you made it this far I guess the only question I have is does anyone have experience with this and how can I help him and her get through this?   TLDR: Husband has crazy high bp and hospitalized. I feel like I am failing helping him and my toddler get through this. I feel like I have no one to talk to. Being 35 weeks pregnant is not making anything easier.

"My dad is getting older, in bad shape and is too stubborn to do anything about it I love my parents, but over the past 10 years my dad has been gaining weight and eating junk that has made him become pretty unhealthy. About 4 years ago, he suffered from a heart attack before I headed to work; he collapsed in front of my mom and I had to run out the door and knock on both my neighbors doors since they both new CPR. Luckily, the paramedics came in time and he was able to survive through surgery. He's on medication now and all of his tests have come through positive, but he is still overweight. He's 61 and I realize he's not getting any younger. My mother and I have been trying to get him to eat healthier and stop drinking so much, he drinks chardonnay every night and a lot of it a week. EVERY time we bring it up, he immediately diverts the topic to something else, and blames us for being negative and to be more ""positive"". He says he works too much and that we are just ganging up on him. Psychologically I believe he's just so stubborn that he won't ever admit to actually being unhealthy and doing something about it. He's tried to workout but he never makes much progress.  I want my dad to live for as long as possible, but he's just so incredibly stubborn and toxic about it that eventually i'm afraid he's not going to last much longer, we are both incredibly frustrated. Our doctor who monitors him has even told my mother "" Your father is a very nice man, but if he continues doing what he's doing, you need to raise your life insurance"".

"I want a cat so much due to depression and loneliness... I once had a cat I had got for my 16th birthday over 10 years ago before she died at a bit of a young age just almost a year ago. She helped me so much whenever I had suicidal thoughts; when I would get them and tell myself how much I should die, I would think of her, and then ask myself ""Who would take care of her? She would be so devastated if her own master was gone. I could never do that to her.""  But ever since her death, I think I've been more depressed and lonely without her. I've been so much more angry and isolated, I think. I want a furry companion so, so much, but I don't think it will happen anytime soon, no matter how urgent or how much I rather need one, and that makes me even more depressed. There's been so much going on, so it's not a good time to look for a kitten; however, the thing is, I don't know how much longer I have to wait, and I don't know how much longer I \*can\* wait, because my family moved, and the house we live in is being renovated, so I don't even have a room yet. My wild guess is that it could take maybe a year for everything to settle, but I cannot wait that long at all before getting a cat.  I'm torn. Should I just get a cat for the sake of my health, or should I endure the wait a little longer so things can settle down a bit more?",1,want cat depression loneliness cat got th birthday year ago died bit young age just year ago helped suicidal thought tell die think her ask who care her devastated master gone her death think depressed lonely her angry isolated think want furry companion so much not think happen anytime soon matter urgent need one make depressed going on not good time look kitten however thing is not know longer wait not know longer can wait family moved house live renovated not room yet wild guess maybe year settle wait long getting cat torn just cat sake health endure wait little longer thing settle bit more
" Elizabeth and I took a tube from Morden to Aldgate East. Had a marvelous vergetable curry with the most fragrant rice I have ever had.  Not bad for 8 quid for both of us.

"My bestie guilt trips me constantly My best friend moved to the other side of Canada. Anyone who knows anything about North American geography knows that Canada is effing huge and so it's expensive to travel that far west.   I've planned a really awesome solo backpacking trip to Southeast Asia. Five countries in 13 weeks. Anyway, when she found out, she was pissed I'm not spending that money on going out to see her instead. And she said something like ""if I had any extra cash I'd be using it to come see you""... Which makes me feel like absolute crap. She clearly doesn't understand wanderlust... I wanna see other cultures and it's just not the same to travel within your own country. Anyway, after she said that I snapped and said I'm done with her guilt trips. This is just one example of her pulling this kind of thing.   Did I do the right thing?

" Of course the first week went by... not juz wnet by but with events that made me realised that teaching is no longer teaching.  Firstly, 34 periods as a begining teacher. Really heavy. More than double when compared to my practicum dayz. But i took it in a good stride. I took it more of a challenge and I have to live up to it.  What I am even more surprised is that, I have to work more than 15 hrs a day. Is this crasy or what. The first week, the only day that I managed to leave sch early was on fri, which was to go for fridy prayers. This is because on the 30 and 1 of July, there were induction programmes for the new teahcers. Thus I was not able to prepare lessons for my coming day and I have to continue work at work at home till 12in night. This cycle stated on tues 29 of june where the teahcers had a contact time. Thus my work load on tues was carried on to wed and wed to thurs and thurs to fri. I feel unfair to my students because I personally think I could have prepared a more interesting lessons for them.  But then again when i think abt it, the induction programme could have been carried out much ealier or during the holidays when we came back for the workshop where the entire induction programme could be squeeze into one day.  While, I enjoyed my classes. I love to go to class and present my lessons and see the kids literally grwo in terms of their knowlege and moral development. Thus I realised why there is a high percentage of teachers leaveing the work force because teaching is no longer teaching. There are lots of admin stuff which begining teacher like me have to managed.   Fortunately I have a very helpful department which keep in me check with the stuff that is going ard in the school, like booking of the AVA room or the computer lab. Despite all the heavy first week, I look many new things which have kept my teahcing passion alive. One of them is the love for the students. Seeing the ability to see them grow is something I feel no amount of money can buy.  I guess i need more time to get mysekf acustome to the sch policy and work culture. We see how it goes in the second week then. Till then.. signing out wery and still hopeful.....

"Got rejected again today. I have had this massive crush on this girl for a while now and we been getting along really well. I was suprised to find out we had quite a bit in common and I felt so giddy every time I talked to her. I decided today I would suprise her with an early Valentine's Day gift and maybe she would like it. Nothing huge, I got her favorite snack and a brief note telling her how I felt. I don't know what I was expecting but she read it the note and walked away with the gift. She texted me a few minutes later she was nervous to reject me because she knew I was afraid and she would like to stay friends. I can't blame her for how she feels, it's her choice. Although, I feel utterly defeated. I have never been on a date or been kissed, or in any relationship with someone. I thought maybe this would be it, but I was wrong.

I've had one since i was 13, plan of course, not shitty pre paid which Evan always complains about, and, I've always had a regular wage earning job to pay for my phone bill.

"What makes someone weird? I've often been told by people (that like and don't like me alike) that I'm weird. I've become a guarded person because of it but I also embrace that others think of me as...unique. I am generally a confident person. I think I'm nice, genuine, smart and funny and have been told by others that I'm very attractive. What's always bothered me though is not quite knowing why people think I'm weird. I think this information could be useful for first impressions like dates or interviews so I know how to temper this a little. At least initially. The only thing I can think of is that I love horror movies. In general, my interests seem pretty average otherwise (shopping, reading, traveling, etc).

"Is it stress, depression or burn out? Hey,  I’m a diabetic 1 with Autism. For the past 3 years i have felt constant fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems, bad memory and concentration issues.  I took antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg before this during 8 months for major stress and it helped me with almost no side effects.  But after i quit antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg ,the fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems and concentration issues has been persistent in my life. Now for 3 years.  No matter how much rest i get i feel tired. Even if excercise, eat healthy, do yoga and meditation.  My blood sugar levels has been up and down lately. But even if they are controlled i feel the same.   A cause could be that i have worked on a lot of projects during the past 3 years.   It went as far as that i started to get suicide thoughts. I do not feel any ups or downs in my life. Things i used to like to do isles enjoyable. I rather stay at home than being social.  I believe i have major depression and i have visited psychologist and psychiatrist who have advised me to take antidepressants.  But the question is if I’m stressed, have major depression or simply burnt out.  I certainly feel that i have a huge major depression. My OCD thought are back and i have been stuck on testing my blood sugar 10-15 times per day during the past year. Which also could bring my stress levels up. The past year has been very stressful for me work wise. But even if i get a weekend of rest i don’t feel rested. I have been to different psychiatrists and psychologist and the conclusion is either major depression or burn out.  I barely have the energy to clean my apartment anymore, wash my clothes or think about my hygiene. I feel tearful occasionally on some days.   I have thought about taking antidepressants again, particularly Cymbalta since it worked for me the first time. But i have been afraid of taking them.   Instead my psychiatrist described me brintellix (Vortioxetine), 10 mg per day for my depression.  But the question is, i’m i stressed, depressed or burnt out? Anyone have been in a similar case?   Any experiences of the antidepressants brintellix (Vortioxetine) for major depression? I’m so afraid of starting to take them, but i don’t want to feel this way of every morning waking up with no motivation for anything that the day brings me.

"Living At Home With Untrustworthy Family Member This post may be a bit long, but I really need advice , outside of the obvious ""just move out"" , which I will be doing soon, but I need advice for until I do.  So I live at home with an untrustworthy uncle who has shown me that I can't trust him. He talks about people behind their back, personally talks down to me, purposely does things to hold me back (such as will place a setback in my way knowing it will affect my moving out --- he asks me to drive someone somewhere using my car during the time I have to be at work, ect.) .  Anyway,  my uncle wants me to contribute to the household by paying $50.00 towards the electric bill. So I go, ""Ok, no problem.""  That is a big problem because I was initially thinking I could go to a bill payment center and just directly pay it there as my debit card company (AMEX, Visa, ect) isn't accepted by the electric company. I called the electric company and was told if I go to a billpayment center that I need the bill or at least the account number. I have neither and am unable to access either because my uncle takes the bill . I have asked to see it, both asking my aunt and uncle.  My aunt says ""I am trying to complicate things,"" and informed me that my uncle pays everything via his bank account,which really means to ""contribute"", I am really having to pay my uncle $50 after he pays the whole bill from his bank account.   I don't want to do that because I am looking at having to give him that $50 , which is really going in his pocket, versus to the electric company, as a waste of money. I want to be sure my money is going where it is supposed to go (to the electric bill, and not in my uncle's pockets).  When my sister lived here, they let her have access to the bills and pay them or parts of them how she wanted.  We are two years apart, her being 28, and me being 26.  My uncle wastes a lot of money on hookah, and products on Amazon. He believes that my grandmother's house is his house (which is not true at all.)   They, being my uncle and aunt are not allowing me to do things the way I want. I want to ensure that my money is going directly to the electric company in particularly because when I have contributed to the household as they (my aunt and uncle) have asked, I have watched my money be used in an unscrupulous manner and have had to deal with them (my aunt and uncle) basically monopolizing my time, so I can never progress with what I need to do in life, such as move out. My aunt tried to ask me how much money I bring in a month, and I refused to tell her. In my family, my family feels like if you are not forthcoming with information then something shady or bad has to be going on. In my case, that is not true. I am a young woman wanting to better herself and continue pursuing her passions (ones that actually will provide for myself and my OWN family --- children, ect if I have any) and leave a legacy behind when my time comes.  I am thinking not of just today, but later on down the line.   My uncle is very immature. While his mother (my grandmother) was in the hospital due to a heart attack and stroke, he brought a random woman over and had sex with her in his mother's bed, and the girl was very loud and disrespectful considering that I am right down the hall. (Keep in mind, he has his own room on the third floor of the house where no one would be able to hear or see anything he is doing). He also has a superiority complex.   My grandmother is still sick, and is supposedly coming home soon. I am trying to save so I can move, and have been the one helping my grandmother while she is sick. I am aware that I am dealing with a toxic family member (well, family members.)   My uncle will downtalk me, calling me a bum, saying I don't have certain things, because he doesn't see where any of my money is at or goes (He isn't supposed to, I am a grown adult) , but at the same time, putting every road block in my way to keep me in a position where I can't get on better footing. I honestly feel my family just wants someone that they can talk about and put down. I have told my family that I don't have access to cash, so I can continue to save and move. I did say I can contribute in other ways. I have been the pariah of my family due to what a lot of people have said about me, lies and things that are untrue. I have family members that just want me to fail. I know that for sure.   I have thought about waiting for next month's bill to come, and taking the account number off of it to directly pay my portion of the electric bill.   To anyone who feels I may be being selfish, complaining , or lazy,  I am none of those things. I am currently working and saving money to move to another state. I was taught at an early age to trust my gut, and everything is all messed up right now. I have watched my family and am aware of how they operate. I don't want to be around people I can't trust. Family will betray you faster than your enemies.   I am asking regarding this situation, what should I do and what advice do you suggest for dealing with toxic family members who make fun of your dreams and put obstacles in your way to hold you back from succeeding ? Also getting the account number off of the bill after the bill comes --- how good of an idea is that?",0,living home untrustworthy family member post bit long really need advice outside obvious just out doing soon need advice do live home untrustworthy uncle shown trust him talk people back personally talk me purposely doe thing hold such place setback way knowing affect moving asks drive using car time work ect anyway uncle want contribute household paying electric bill go ok problem big problem initially thinking payment center just directly pay debit card company amex visa ect not accepted electric company called electric company told billpayment center need account number unable access uncle take asked it asking aunt uncle aunt say i trying complicate thing informed uncle pay bank accountwhich really mean contribute really having pay uncle pay bank account not want looking having really going pocket versus electric company waste money want sure money going supposed to electric bill not uncle pocket sister lived here let access bill pay part wanted year apart uncle waste lot money hookah product amazon belief grandmother house house which not true all they uncle aunt not allowing thing way want want ensure money going directly electric company particularly contributed household my aunt uncle asked watched money used unscrupulous manner deal my aunt uncle basically monopolizing time progress need life out aunt tried ask money bring month refused tell her family family feel like not forthcoming information shady bad going on case not true young woman wanting better continue pursuing passion one actually provide family child ect any leave legacy time come thinking not just today later line uncle immature mother my grandmother hospital heart attack stroke brought random woman sex mother bed girl loud disrespectful considering right hall keep mind room floor house able hear doing superiority complex grandmother sick supposedly coming home soon trying save move helping grandmother sick aware dealing toxic family member well family member uncle downtalk me calling bum saying not certain thing doe not money go he not supposed to grown adult time putting road block way position better footing honestly feel family just want talk down told family not access cash continue save move did say contribute way pariah family lot people said me lie thing untrue family member just want fail know sure thought waiting month come taking account number directly pay portion electric bill feel selfish complaining lazy thing currently working saving money state taught early age trust gut messed right now watched family aware operate not want people trust family betray faster enemy asking regarding situation advice suggest dealing toxic family member make fun dream obstacle way hold succeeding getting account number come good idea that
Hi. My name is Jenna. I'm 20 years old and just joined and figured that I should introduce myself. I found this site from searching online and think that it's great. I only started accepting the fact that I've been depressed last year because I've always been very good at hiding it from everyone else and I used to fool myself as well (if that makes sense). I've never been one to seek help from others because in the past I've always dealt with everything myself. The start of college and being outside (different state) of my home environment (which is the cause of a lot of anger and resentment that I also have) helped me to see that there was something wrong with the way that I was living and that I could reach out and get help. I'm currently seeing a counselor (through my college and since I feel like I'm working well with her that I don't need to seek other outside help yet) about my anxiety and depression but I feel that talking to others that are going through the same thing could help give me a different view on everything and be helpful as well. I'm glad that I stumbled across these forums and I can't wait to get to know some of you.

"People I love keep dying. I can't take it anymore. On New Year's Eve I got a phone call at 1 in the morning that one of my closest friends died. I didn't believe it. I thought it was a joke. It wasn't. His brother made a post on Facebook letting everyone know. It felt like a bad dream.  I couldn't stop crying. I cried at work. I tried to get time off, but they didn't offer bereavement for people who weren't immediate family.  I was so distraught that I couldn't go to the funeral. I was afraid to see his body. I hate myself for being so weak. He was 28. It shouldn't be. He should still be alive.  Four months later, my grandfather died. We were close. The last time we talked he said ""that's my sweetheart, that's my pride and joy."" I sat with him in the hospital and watched Aubrey Hepburn. We promised to see each other again soon.  I saw him a week later in hospice. He was catatonic. I told him it was okay to let go, okay to move on if he was in pain. They say hearing is the final sense to go. He died thirty minutes after I left.  On July 1st my mother told me that she's been diagnosed with cancer. They took a biopsy of her lymph node yesterday to see if it has spread there. She is on a month of leave from work.  That was the final straw for me, I think. I feel like a shell of who I was before December 31st. I am terrified of the future. I remember when my friend died, I asked myself who I would lose next. I had no idea things would spiral down and down.  Everyday is a struggle for me to stay at work. All I want to do is sleep. I have constant migraines (a chronic condition), and the pain paired with the grief is absolute hell. I started seeing a counselor about a month ago, and I like her but she can only do so much. I am on medication, and I have a good support system.   But the sorrow is just overwhelming. I feel like this grief is never going to end. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to them. I don't want to lose my mom. I'm not even thirty. I'm not ready to wake up knowing that she isn't with me anymore. I can't take anymore. I have been crying all day.  I don't really know what I expect to see from anyone here, but I'm just so lost.",1,people love dying anymore new year eve got phone morning closest friend died did not believe it thought joke not brother post facebook letting know felt like bad dream not stop cry cried work tried time off did not offer bereavement people not immediate family distraught not funeral afraid body hate weak not be alive month later grandfather died close time talked said that sweetheart pride joy sat hospital watched aubrey hepburn promised soon saw week later hospice catatonic told okay let go okay pain say hearing final sense go died thirty minute left july st mother told diagnosed cancer took biopsy lymph node yesterday spread there month leave work final straw me think feel like shell december st terrified future remember friend died asked lose next idea thing spiral down everyday struggle stay work want sleep constant migraine a chronic condition pain paired grief absolute hell started seeing counselor month ago like much medication good support system sorrow just overwhelming feel like grief going end not ready say goodbye them not want lose mom not thirty not ready wake knowing not anymore anymore cry day not really know expect here just lost
"According to the mental health nurse i'm not depressed So since october 2016 i've been (or at least thought I had) been depressed. I dropped out of school, started self harming and was put in hospital twice among other things. I spent nearly the whole of 2017 at home doing nothing because I simply couldn't. I got a full time job in september but I hated it and it made me worse and I had to quit after I started self harming again and have been cutting up until now (i'm 18 by the way if that's important).  Things have been getting worse again recently. I'm cutting almost every night and feel down and just cant do anything. I don't even have the energy to shower most days and just stay in bed until the late afternoon. However I was hopeful for today as I was going to see a new nurse who I was hoping would be able to set up a plan to help me. I was with the child services before and had an amazing nurse who helped me greatly but as i'm 18 i'm classed as an adult so have to go to the adult services.   So as soon as I met the new nurse and we went into the room to talk she told me she knows almost nothing about me despite there being many notes from the past year. I told her about leaving my job and feeling low and the self harm and everything and what she basically told me is ''you aren't depressed''. She said that my self harm was normal as it was just scratches and I wasn't cutting deep enough to leave any scars which just completely confused me considered i'd been put in hospital partly for doing the same thing before. I've also suffered with terrible social anxiety all my life and find it very hard to communicate with others. I told her the only friends i've ever had was the friends I've made years ago when I first started going to school and what she said was it sounds like I have great social skills as i've been able to make friends. It honestly felt like she wasn't listening to a single word I was saying. As I said she had no notes from before and was basically just assuming what was wrong with me and that was it. Also I should add i'm in the UK so this is with the NHS so i'm not paying for this however my parents have said they would be willing to pay for some sessions with a therapist if that's was I need.  I'm sorry if this is long or it just sounds like i'm complaining. I just wanted other peoples opinions on this as I just don't know what to think.

"I just love sleeping Just getting in my covers and wrap myself in a blanket. Everything's dark and my body's resting. I wish I could be there all my life.   I dream, sometimes, but normally I don't dream. And that's when I'm the happiest. I just feel like I'm dead and have no problems.  Just the ritual of wrapping myself and then getting comfortable is the only thing to make me smile. I then daydream, and in that state where I'm conscious but not enough to acknowledge my problems, I fall asleep.  But then there comes tomorrow, and sometimes I wish I could have stayed awake all night to avoid waking up and facing reality, but then I remember I love sleeping.

" This is the product of idle time. Usually phone support during queue time does not give us this much idle time, that is until you are one of two who have a direct customer service split. Then you get to sit around and do nothing but wait for one of two tiny lights to come on for you to answer the phone. Lucky for me this phenomenon does not happen very often on weekends. Therefore I am left here contemplating the future, browsing for new platform games, twiddling my thumbs, and feeling a little guilty because the rest of my team is busy taking calls. Not that I really mind the rest, but you kind of wish everybody else was resting with you. Right now I really wish I were home already inflicting pain upon my thumb by pushing on a little analog stick on my PS 2 but then again I come in and work all night so I can pay for my little electronic addiction. Of course I think I'm rambling now because I really just don't have that much to do, so if this were a piece in English class I would probably flunk because of the lack of coherence in this post. Then again since its not then I think I'll ramble on, that is if I get to think of anything more to ramble about. Hmmm, the light came on interrupting my train of thought, but I'm back now. Now I'm wondering how I'm going to fund my CD habit. I really want to get my own copies of so many discs now I think I'm going to drive myself crazy thinking about where all my money went. After I get my credit card bill gets to me that is, but then again at least CD's are tangible and they happen to be mine.

"I've lost 4 Marines to depression and almsost lost a 5th. None saw combat. I need help understanding. Hi.   I just had my 4th funeral in 7 years for yet another Marine. A few days ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down.  These 5 Marines, as far as i can tell suffer/suffered from depression. Pretty much every one of them was intelligent (like way too smart for the Marine Corps) and each of them stood out as ""the funny one"". To say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement.   The Marine Corps has done a lot to try and help suicidal Marines, but all our training videos depict some ""clearly distressed"" person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves. In reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help.  What I'm asking:  As someone who has never suffered depression (Ive been ""depressed"" but that was from external factors like a job not working out or a girl leaving me. I consider that normal human emotion), how do I identify Marines under my care thst may be suffering and need help.  They are NOT giving the outward signs in the stupid ""Lance Corporal Decker video"" we watch once a year.  Thanks.  Edit: been at work all day then went to visit a former Marine that dealt with some serious issues in his day but is doing well now. Mulled over a lot of this with him, then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful responses.  I have read every one, some several times. I have a lot to consider and learn, but thank you for helping me find some direction.  One thing i didn't mention is my role in all this. Im not sone big wig commander with tools at my disposal.  Im a newly promoted Sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guys under me. The one we just burried was not in my platoon, but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss. The other three were guys i was close to back in training, but i was not currently stationed with them when it happened. In fact i found out about all three of them on Facebook.   This recent one, and the one that called me with suicidal thoughts, have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me. The scary thing to me is, even with hindsight, i wouldn't have picked these five guys out of the lot as having ANY kind of issues, let alone suicidal tendencies.   I have also noticed, maybe because of my nature or leadership style, that im the one people tend come to with problems. I make it known that im here for that purpose, and people take me up on it. So I guess now i want to make sure i can spot when someone needs more help than they may be openly asking for. I will be more vigilant in my assessments of the needs of those under my watch.  Thank you all for the detailed and informed replies.

"I think you guys might understand this. I was walking with a close friend after having lunch together, and I told her, ""I feel as if I'm living on borrowed time.""  She asked me to explain further, but I couldn't find the words to better express that perspective.  She then proceeded to recount to me all of the myriad ways she's nearly died on some of the trips she's taken.  I confessed that I couldn't really relate to those sorts of situations or how they've affected her, as she has more zeal for life than anyone I've ever met.  Whatever she was describing about perceived proximity to death didn't suit me.  Then the words came to me.  I feel as if I'm living on borrowed time, because I feel like I could, at any moment, lose what little will to live I have left.  It's like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I see it in slow-motion, slowly falling to the cold pavement, but I don't know when it will finally make contact.  In the meantime, I'm existing, trying to experience new things and connect to people as much as I am able to, but I can't shake the conviction that I'll eventually resolve to leave by my own hand, despite whatever life I've made for myself.  The fight's already been lost, and at some point, I'll have to accept defeat.

"I really need some advice *trigger warning* *trigger warning*  Hi everyone. I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong. This is my first time visiting this subreddit, and so I don't know what's generally expected or done on here. Let me just get into this.   I'm 22 and I've never experienced depression. I'm a Psychology major and I've taken classes over the topic, but I know reading about it can only give me so much insight. The reason I'm posting on here is because I have a 12 year old cousin who tried cutting herself the other day. She's depressed, says she wants to die, and I am so, so worried about her. She lives a few hours from me and is being watched closely right now, but I plan on going out to visit her this weekend.   To be honest, she has a horrible living situation. My aunt (her mom) is awful. To my aunt, every problem can be solved by God, she's financially fucked and letting it out on my cousins, and she's extremely dismissive of my cousins feelings, needs, and emotions. It also doesn't help that my cousin is adopted, and I know she just feels detached from her own family.   Anyways, I know that there's no such thing as simply getting your advice on how to fix my cousins depression. I know how complex of an issue this is. What I want to know from you all is if there is anything I can do this weekend to just show her that things can get better. My little cousin has always looked up to me, and I plan on taking her out to do some of the things that she always wants to do (like go to the park, make slime, whatever 12 year olds like). But is there anything extra I can do? Is there anything that you all wish someone told you? Or maybe even something you wish they didn't?   I would really appreciate any tips or advice you all have for me this weekend. I know my cousin has a very long road ahead of her, but I want to do anything I can to make it easier. Thank you.   tl;dr my 12 year old cousin is depressed and attempting to hurt herself. I'm going to visit her this weekend. Is there anything I can do (or shouldn't do), that might at least show her that things can get better.

" Today when I woke up, I got yelled at by my dad over the phone for oversleeping. He told me that I had to go and make something for my sisters to eat, because they are hungry! I was like tired, because I had like stayed up till 3 am trying to fix my damn ghetto computer. I made something for them to eat, but one of them didn't want to eat. I got so pissed and I made her eat. She ate it and everything went fine. Then I decided to fix my computer and I tried installing another version of XP on it. It almost broke down. I was so totally freaked out! I mean god damn! Then Thomas had to call and I had to go over to Sloan's house cause he just got a multi tap. (like I cared if i he just got one!). Well I went anywayz and had a really lame time. I am not really good at video games, I mean fighting games. We then played an NBA game and I totally sucked at it. I suck at the real thing, what makes them think that I could play a fake version? When I got home, my computer was fixed and I was happy. But then I had to defrag it and I was pissed. Then I went to the upstairs computer and I started to type in my blog! I had to fix the internet connection first. While typing this, the TV said that Linkin Park has a new video coming out and it is one of my favorite songs. ""breaking the habit"" and there is a making the video at 6 pm tomorrow (i think) and I am totally psyched that they have a new video! So now i feel bored.

"Imminent Death of a Loved One So let me start by saying I’ve been fortunate enough to have never lost a family member or really close friend, so this is all foreign to me.  My grandpa has had cancer for quite a while and it’s getting worse. Whenever I visit it’s something that is never really talked about and he seems to not really want to talk about it and doesn’t really let any of us know what is going on and down plays the situation. Recently I’ve picked up on several indicators that lead me to believe the end is near. I don’t really know what the best thing to do is, but I know one thing and that’s that I don’t want to miss any moments, let him down in his last days or regret anything for the rest of my life. He has lived a long and extraordinary life and has so many stories and so much wisdom. One thing is that I want to be able to tell my future kids about him and carry on that legacy after he passes and there are many stories that I can’t myself recite and many that I am sure that I haven’t even heard. I guess what I’m looking for is maybe someone who has gone through this sort of thing and can share maybe some things that they did or wish they would’ve done before their loved one passed away. Two things kind of come to mind but I don’t know how to bring it up. Maybe to have him write some things down in a journal or to record something. I’m also just open to hearing anyone else’s stories.  Thanks in advance",0,imminent death loved let start saying fortunate lost family member really close friend foreign me grandpa cancer quite getting worse visit really talked not really want talk doe not really let know going play situation recently picked indicator lead believe end near not really know best thing is know thing not want miss moment let day regret rest life lived long extraordinary life story wisdom thing want able tell future kid carry legacy pass story recite sure not heard guess looking maybe gone sort thing share maybe thing did wish loved passed away thing kind come mind not know bring up maybe write thing journal record something just open hearing story thanks advance

"Maybe They are Wrong About It All We are always told ""when you are depressed, your brain is lying to you about how bad everything is"".   What if they are wrong?  If someone is piss poor and starving, can't pay their bills, replace their moth-eaten clothes or go out to do interesting things, surely their money situation really IS as bad as all that.  If someone has no family, no friends and has been bullied/abused by everyone they've met in life, perhaps their social situation really IS as bad as all that.  If someone has had lots of physical health issues like cancer, chronic pain, obesity etc, maybe their physical woes really ARE as bad as all that.  Some people go through all of the above, all at once. So maybe life IS as bad as all that for them.  The whole ""your brain is lying about how bad things are"" thing often just feels like ""you're just imagining your problems"". Like, I know depression etc make your brain incapable of dealing with them properly, but it doesn't mean legitimate problems don't exist and that some people's lives aren't thoroughly worthless all the same.",1,maybe wrong told when depressed brain lying bad is wrong piss poor starving pay bill replace motheaten clothes interesting thing surely money situation really bad that family friend bulliedabused met life social situation really bad that lot physical health issue like cancer chronic pain obesity etc maybe physical woe really bad that people above once maybe life bad them your brain lying bad thing are thing just feel like you just imagining problem like know depression make brain incapable dealing properly doe not mean legitimate problem not exist people life not thoroughly worthless same

"Life for me is gonna fall apart and it'll be the end of me (this is my first post and I'm on mobile so sorry if the formatting is off)   So recently my parents have been on me (M 17) about getting a job, getting college information, SAT information, getting my licence and spending more time with the family. Tonight they both came at me and yelled about how I wasn't going to amount to anything and that I pretty much am ruining their current lives. They threw so much at me that it broke me and I broke down in the bathroom.   My only remedy for all this pain is my girlfriend. She's there for me no matter what and understands what I go through. Recently I've been slipping a little in my grades (All B's and C's) and my parents have a very strict rule that if I don't keep good grades I'll have to leave my girlfriend. My problem is that if I leave her I'll have nothing to help me get through hard times. I'm only living for her and I'll have no point to be around otherwise.

"Glad I can help! Firelizardee has helped me a lot over on the effexor room (that's where most of my posts are). I've never really posted my story, but for what it's worth, here it is: I live in northern New York State where I grew up on the family farm. My brother and I run a feed/hardware/farm supply store. I've got a terrific wife and two daughters ages 1 and 3. My depression hit in January during a bout with the flu; my youngest daughter was hospitalized with febrile seizures and that might be what put me over the edge. My nervous breakdown seemed to come out of the blue, but I'd had an extremely stressful six months between job, illness, and adoption.  I'm also a hard driving firstborn perfectionist, and several family members have had alcoholism or suspected depression. So I guess depression should not have been so big a surprise, but it was. I'm a happy person with a great life! But I feel like I've been right to the edge of the precipice and looked down at Hell. Now I'm doing everything I can to ensure I don't relapse.....but I actually think I'm a better person having been through this. I'm much more appreciative of a 'good day' and I'm much more attuned to the suffering of others. It's amazing how many people I know have similar problems. And I hate that it has to be this way, but suffering does bring me closer to God. I hardly dare say that depression and anxiety was 'worth it'....the memory of the anguish is still too vivid, and besides, it could come back tomorrow. But right now, today, I feel more contented with my crazy, precious, stupid, dear, wasted, amazing life than I have been in years. I'm very lucky to have stumbled onto the right medication the first time, and to have a supportive family that didn't tell me to 'snap out of it'. And I'm very lucky to have the people here in this forum, who know what it's like. I hope, tvk, that in a few weeks you too will be a recovering depression survivor.

"I joined yesterday and have been reading through some of the posts. Thought I had better introduce my self.  I live in the UK.  Looking back on my life I think I have always had depression. It got worse though, 3.5 years ago after the birth of my son. I though i had PND at the time. I was always crying, felt really low and would panic if I was left alone with the baby. It put a huge strain on my marriage and lots of arguments because my husband though I had gone off him. I went back to work put couldn't cope, lack of motivation etc. but like someone said below I put on a 'happy face' to make people think that I was OK. I muddled through for a year then went to see a GP who put me on Prozac. Stupid me came off it after 2 months thinking I was OK. Slowly the depression came back, I wasn't coping with my job, the simplest tasks at work and at home were impossible to face, I couldn't concentrate or make decisions. Last Spring it all got too much. I was getting up crying every morning, I became agoraphobic. I phoned in work and said i couldn't go in. I saw the GP and went on Prozac. I took 2 months off work. I stayed on Prozac until last September. And then, guess what, it all came back with a vengeance a few months ago. This time I was also feeling suicidal which really scared me. So I am now back on the Prozac and determined to stay on it.  I think I have generalized depression made worse by circumstances. The birth of my son, trying to keep a job down and be a Mom, and my husband. Last year my husband really turned to alcohol and ended up ill in hospital. He has been on incapacity benefit ever since, so our relationship and our finances have really suffered. He has changed to. Even though he says he loves me he gets angry a lot, shouts at me, criticizes me, puts me down. I don't know how much more of it I can take, without leaving him. I make excuses for him, that it is his illness and lack of earning power that make him like that but it is no excuse to turn me into a nervous wreck who is scared to say anything in case he shoots me down. The Prozac has reduced but not removed my depression and I still have the odd day where I want to run away. I keep thinking 'will it go away if I leave my husband?' I no longer love him but life has dealt a difficult blow to us both recently and maybe one day when the stresses have been removed I will love him again.  Anyway that's my story (sounds similar to Vanyas who i have PM'd).

"Relationship with my Dad Hey, I post this as I need help on how to deal with the situation on my relationship with my Dad. Don't get me wrong, I do love him- however I am not sure that I like him to the extent that he likes me. By like, I mean as a ""buddy"" relationship, we have similar interests and we talk about these interests a lot, but his personality irritates me and we have gotten in a lot of arguments, of which I never convince him.  I am currently in University, I am living on campus (this is the first time living on my own), and I must say: I am absolutely loving it. Having my first time being independent has made me feel much better. Mainly because I am away from home. I have this thing where I just want to be independent, not influenced by other people's views/thoughts (my Dad mainly). A couple of years ago my Mum and Dad broke up, I stayed with my Dad as I did not agree with what my Mum had done. Me and my Dad were always close as we are both into Gaming and watching TV shows etc... but it is only recently that I have realized I dislike him.   My Dad can be quick at losing his temper, he lives by the policy of Honesty (which is a good trait), but at the same time- he is completely contradicting. In arguments we get into, I explain my view and so does he, however he turns my view against me and then later apoligises for not understanding, making sure he will listen better in future. This never happens. This has persisted over the years and it makes me feel uneasy talking to him about anything. I then feel guilty about not wanting to talk to him. Which brings me to my next issue.  He talks to me daily. Once in morning, some points during the day and then at night. I understand this is his first time living alone too, but I need my space and it is physically and mentally draining having to talk to him. Especially as I feel forced to keep the conversation going. Pretty much the majority of the conversation is me talking about my day, my thoughts on things and anything interesting that happened. He briefly mentions his stuff, but then there is silence. I try to keep the conversation flowing, but it does NOT feel natural at all. It is not like the conversations I have with my friends or other members of the family. Which again, makes me feel guilty when I want to hang up. I really have tried to change my perspective.   It is getting close to moving back home (I am a first year student) and will be commuting from my home town to University for the upcoming years at Uni. I am really not looking forward to this. I am enjoying spending time AWAY from home, to avoid my Dad. Now I am going to have to live with him for the next few years.   Now I do love him, and he does everything for me. He is trying to pay off my Student loans so I feel comfortable, and I have been saving for my deposit that I will put on a house after my time at Uni. But the issue is, I really want independence. I feel guilty that I want to live in the city where my Uni is and work to pay joint rent with friends. This way I learn the world of work, but that comes with having higher stress as I'd have to work and study. Which is what my dad doesn't agree with. And trying to explain to him that I want to learn the world of work does not compute with him. As rationally speaking, there are many more benefits of me commuting. And I cannot win, I really can't. He wants me to get the best oppotunity I can in life, and make sure that I get my Masters. But, he is deciding and forcing my path for me. I feel restricted and it makes me feel down most days for each time I have to talk to him. It just reminds me of the next 3 years being stuck at home with him, him thinking we have this great relationship where I just prefer literally anything else.

"overbearing family. I (19f) am living away from home for college in my 2nd year. However, I still feel very under the control of my mother. It is just me and her at home, and rest assured she has always done her best for me but recently I’ve had enough of how much she expects from me. I am studying for grade 6 piano and the fact is that I simply don’t have time for it. She wanted me to do the exam for it after only studying it for 3 months (bare in mind I only get to practice once a week as I have no piano away from home - I come home at weekends). When I postponed it she screamed at me for hours and called me an idiot and various other things. I told her I was too busy with college work, I got my results back for college and did very well; however, she still wasn’t happy. First comment was “maybe you’re not as stupid as we think” and then said that I could do a lot better, even though I did really well.   I never leave the house when I’m at home for weekends or any holidays because when I go out or meet my friends she makes it very difficult as she usually starts a row before I leave and guilt trips me about going.   I have been wanting a full time bar job for summer, as that’s where my experience is but she is even controlling where I work and telling me where to apply to. She keeps guilt tripping me about being away for college, and saying I’m on a permanent holiday.   She is annoyed at me for having a boyfriend; she never uses his name only refers to him as “your friend” in a sneering voice, and she won’t meet him.   She is by no means a bad person, she has always been a very good mother but the pressure she is putting on me is too much and I feel very restricted, and at times, controlled. BUT I am not giving out about her, simply want to understand why she is acting this way when I’ve given her no reason to distrust me and I’m trying my best.

"[Serious]I broke a close friends heart and now i don't know what to do? [Serious] So i've been friends with this girl for around 4 years and we got really close for the past 1 year. I started having problems with other friends family and uni like 3 months ago. Basically a depressive state. And i started to treat this friend badly during these months. Sometime i would realize it and go ""sorry i've been treating you bad for the last couple of days because of etc etc"" And she always went it's okay i can understand you. For the last 2 weeks i realized that she started ignoring my texts and stuff. I waited 5 days for a reply to a single text.

"I know life isn't easy but I never knew it would be this hard... :( I feel empty and numb, but at the same time so sad and hurt... My biggest struggle is with my family, the only person that is there for me is my Step Dad... No one else seems to get it? My mum is always telling me to not keep secrets and that I should tell her how I feel coz if she doesn't know everything how can she help me? But I don't want to have to tell her everything (Because she says hurtful things back at me once I tell her and she won't even hug me) but if I don't tell her she makes me feel so bad and so I do tell her how I feel and then she shoots me down! She tells me to snap out of it and just get on with it and to stop being so stupid... every time I talk to my mum I cry coz she hurts me so much! And then she gets all down coz she makes me down which makes me down!!! I JUST CAN'T WIN! These days I only have to say something like ""oh that sucks, no milk"" and she tells me to get over it or get lost! And all I did was say something. I can't even really explain it? It's like she won't be happy until she hears what she wants to hear... I have tried talking to her about the way she makes me feel and all I get is ""that's just life"" or she starts telling me how she buys me things and that I should feel like this coz she has brought me things and let me use her car, etc, etc... The other day I was haven a really bad day and I asked mum for a hug and all she could say is ""No..."" she says she doesn't want to feed my sadness BUT instead of doing happy things she just tells me to get over it! And she won't listen when I say stop...She even told me to pack my bags and leave once if I didn't get over whatever it was I was going through!

"college- medical withdrawal for a semester Okay, so I'm thinking about either doing a course load reduction or a medical withdrawal due to my anxiety and depression. I've already contacted my academic advisor and the financial aid office, but I honestly have no idea whether everything will work out or not. If I manage to get a course load reduction, does anyone have any ideas for things I can do to help myself get better during this semester? If it ends up not working out, does anyone know about other ways I can go about making this semester less stressful?  For background, I have a scholarship for tuition for the next two years and I'm terrified as fuck that I'll lose that if I get a course load reduction.

I've never felt more alone in my life and I don't know what to do about it. I recently graduated high school with a decent amount of friends but have only really kept in touch with about 3 of them. I'm going to a college two hours away so the likelihood that I'll be able to even see those 3 people is kind of dwindling once I move.   I used to deal with loneliness through friends on PlayStation but even those relationships feel like they're getting distant. I recently started talking to my former best friend from PS4 whom I've known for about 7 years but ever since he started seeing someone it feels like he's gotten meaner to me and doesn't care to be there for me in the same way anymore.   I'm not sure if I'm depressed but I've never felt more alone or lost or confused in my life. I've managed to convince myself that I have no redeeming qualities and that my friends are only pretending to like me because they feel bad or somehow feel obligated to maintain a facade of friendship.   I just want to feel important to someone. Or at least okay enough with myself that I don't need the validation of a relationship to feel valuable.  ,1,felt life not know it recently graduated high school decent friend really kept touch them going college hour away likelihood able people kind dwindling move used deal loneliness friend playstation relationship feel like getting distant recently started talking best friend p known year started seeing feel like gotten meaner doe not care way anymore not sure depressed felt lost confused life managed convince redeeming quality friend pretending like feel bad feel obligated maintain facade friendship just want feel important someone okay not need validation relationship feel valuable

"I lost a friend I just graduated high school and all throughout high school I have struggled with depression and anxiety. At my school, there was this really cute girl who I had a crush on. She was in two of my classes and I got know her pretty well. Although she was kind of out of my league and I could tell she wasn't into me romantically, I never minded just being her friend because she's really sweet and mature compared to most other people at my school. It made me really happy to spend time with her and made my day so much better at school even if it was just walking in the hall for a few minutes. Most of my mental health issues came from school related things and when I was with her I would totally forget about all that stuff. Unfortunately, sometime towards the end of the school year, she started dating another guy and after that she didn't really seem interested in being my friend. Now it's summer and I've tried to keep in touch with her. I send her snapchats sometimes but she usually leaves me on open. I hate seeing pictures of them together.

Admittedly these are, yes, all online friends. I don't really have ""Realside"" friends any more. It's complicated.  What I mean is- if I don't start a conversation, there will be no conversation. If there's a lull in the conversation, I've got to fill it or the conversation ends there. If I make plans with my friends (Usually to play a game, watch a movie, something like that) there's a 90% chance they'll forget, or just lose interest, or ignore it.

This is probably a stupid question but I will ask it.  -When I go to enroll into a new high-school would I need anyone or since I am 18 could I just do it myself.

"I sob thinking about my painfully wasted young years I'm going to write this hopefully without stopping to think myself into madness with corrections and such. Too late I just backspaced two whole sentences! There is this big fucking hard block of concrete in my head that stops me from doing anything including things I like such as drawing and reading. I love going on tumblr and pinterest and deviantart to look at the amazing drawings and paintings people are able to create. Sometimes though, I get really jealous of the fictional characters in the fandoms. Heck, I get really jealous of people in my life and around the world; young people. I just get this sinking, dreadful feeling inside my chest realizing that I'm wasting my young years doing nothing. I'm 24 now, and looking back on my life I've just been a sad, pathetic underachiever with no drive or history of doing anything adventurous. I'm wasting my young years. I'm wasting my young years. It plays over in my head all the time. I can't get my brain to shut off. Every night before I go to bed it plays over and over. I'm just so sad and disappointed in my life and how I've done nothing with it. Even as a little kid I never did anything fun and I don't have any wild stories of adventure, excitement, nor things like ""Lol we were dumb kids yada yada...We did this all the time yada yada..."" I'm sorry for the rant. Writing it out didn't help me get the chants out of my head. I'm so sad guys.

Right now I want to go out, rent a solid 4x4, and drive to some god knows where designated dark space and lay on my back and gaze at the stars in the night sky.

"I get depressed, so I procrastinate, so I get more depressed, etc. I hate my job with a burning passion but I can't bring myself to quit or do anything else.  My job is ""prestigious"" and high-paying so it's the only thing that makes me look successful to family and friends, which makes it the only tiny source of self-worth I have. If I lost my job, everyone would know the useless, depressed piece of shit I really am.  I fucking despise my job though, so I can't bring myself to actually do the work.

I could have an assignment for two weeks and I will still do it from 2:00 am to 7:00 am the night before it's due.

"I've already posted on this forum but  I never really introduced myself.  So here goes:  My name is Amy, and I am 24 years old.  I have two beautiful daughters, ages 5 and 3.  I am also raising my little brother, who is 1.  I have suffered from anxiety attacks since I was 16 and became seriously depressed about 2 years ago.  I was hospitalized once ... when the doctor put me on Zoloft.  Since then I have tried Effexor XR and Klonopin (worked for 8 months) and am supposed to be trying Wellbutrin and Buspar now (scared to start them).  I self - harm when things get too hard for me, and have scars covering much of my left arm due to cutting.  I was recently dismissed from my therapy / psychiatrist due to missed appointments ... and I don't know if I am going to find another one yet.  I think about just letting go sometimes.  Nothing really helps anyways.  The one thing that depresses me the most is my fear of spending the rest of my life alone.  Men seem to think I am only good for one thing ... and I guess I agree.  I hate that I go from being okay ... sometimes for weeks at a time ... and then everything falls apart.  My family supports me ... sometimes.  At least, my mom lets me crash at her house when things are real bad.  My mom and my sister try to be there ... but they get tired of me.  I can't say I had a bad childhood ... I can't remember my childhood.  I went under hypnosis ... had a vision of my dad and became extremely afraid.  I never had a chance to go back and find out why.  Missed too many appointments.  My dad was accused of being abusive (to my mother) and having a violent temper ...  and of molesting my sister and I.  Don't remember.  My dad says my mom left us for two years when I was 2 or 3 years old and was always drunk.  Don't remember.  I spent much of my teen years drunk / high and being promiscuous ... let's just say even my mother knew I had a reputation.  Why?  Don't know.  I have never felt like I belonged ... and the past few years I have felt like I haven't really been living.  Disassociation, I suppose.  I am usually moody, never have any energy, and have started and quit school 3 times to date.  Never accomplished anything but getting my GED ... and the sad thing is ... I'm smart.   I live day to day ... never knowing if it will be a good day or a bad day.  My daughter had missed a lot of school because I can't seem to get her there by 12 in the afternoon.  My mom says she will help ... but I know I am on my own.  Neither of my daughters' father's are any help.  My dad left my little brother with me in November, sends down some money every month... and hasn't seen him since.  Some days I feel like I am on top of things ... most days I feel like things are on top of me ... and smothering me.  I've started writing my daughters a letter letting them know everything I want them to know when they are older ... just in case I'm not around.  I can't say for sure this won't beat me one day, and I want to be prepared.  I love my kids ... but also believe with all my heart they would be better off without me.  Sure ... they love me and I'm their mommy ... but not all mommies are good mommies and not all mommies deserve to raise children.  Love isn't always enough ... because God (is he even real?) knows I would die / kill for my girls.  I know the answers to nothing and have so many questions.  This is my life ...  Scared to be alone ... but I always am.  I read this somewhere and it sums up how I feel:  I'm not hungry ... but I'm starving.  I'm not tired ... but I'm exhausted.  I'm not bleeding ... but I'm dying.  So hi to everyone who is fighting the same fight ...  I just need to know that I am not alone.

"Trying to understand my depressed SO I'm sorry if I'm posting in the wrong sub. I just figured you guys could offer perspective  So my SO is away for work (for more than a month), but we are still in the same time zone. Lately, he's been having bad episodes, but a week ago he said he had a really session with his therapist there. (I'm proud to say that he said I was the only person who managed to convince him to seek professional help!) So, okay, so far so good.   When he has bad days, sometimes he likes to ""check out of the world"". He also feels that opening up about his struggles might be too much of a burden for me. But we had a discussion before wherein I said, I understand that you might need space, but let me know if you're having a bad day, and you're not in a chatty mood. Not sure if this was the right approach, but this was the time before the therapist and after we learned that he had to be away for more than a month. And for the most part, he's been open with me.   This weekend really bothered me because it was radio silence, despite my check ins, and despite not asking ""how are you questions"". For example, we are both big football/soccer fans so I tried to talk about the World Cup. He is a huge fan of the French team which won the Cup.  Nothing.   My anxious nature is making things more challenging because now I'm thinking is it the depression or relationship issues? My anxious self might pester him for answers but I am not sure if that is helpful.  So, I'm not sure how to go about this. Let him be and try not to freak out until he returns?

I am really struggling here with my depression here as I write this out on my lunch break at work. I don't know if I can make it through today. I just got to thinking last night and a few days before: at this point, is it faith or apathy? I just don't really care about anything anymore, not for a long time, many years, in fact. I have always run my life according to my faith. God will provide, God will meet me half way, be thankful for all that I have. I am not struggling with my faith or anything but why am I still around? What am I looking for? What am I waiting on?  I am by no means struggling with my faith but rather where does the line cut off between having faith that things will turn out versus just not giving a shit about anything hoping things will turn out?  I don't know, I guess I just want to lay down for awhile. Dream it all away. Pretend that life isn't bearing down on me or that I am happy. I just want it to be over. All of it. Just take me home, wherever that be.",1,today gonna tough doing okay bit not really slump couple week today help it thinking night pretty torn up mean traditionally religious person believe god jesus died sin good stuff not walk preaching forcing believe others instead try humble really struggling depression write lunch break work not know make today just got thinking night day before point faith apathy just not really care anymore not long time year fact run life according faith god provide god meet half way thankful have not struggling faith around looking for waiting on mean struggling faith doe line cut having faith thing turn versus just not giving shit hoping thing turn out not know guess just want lay awhile dream away pretend life not bearing happy just want over it just home be
"I'm annoyed and tired of living with my brother I have lived with my brother while I'm in college. Ever since I moved in, he has never washed the dishes or swept or mopped or clean anything really. He will only wash the dishes when I'm back home for breaks, and that's because there's no one else to do it for him. Every time my parents come and visit us, I'm the one who has to clean the whole apartment. He doesn't help me with any of that. One time I just snapped because my parents were coming to visit us and I had been cleaning the apartment all day and she wanted me to wash his sheets and clean his bathroom and I said no, if there's one thing he can do when he gets home from work it's take the time to clean his bathroom and wash his sheets. My mom bitched at me because I wouldn't do it. But I'm just so tired of having to do everything myself. In case anyone asks, yes, I do pay my half of the rent with my own money. So it's not fair. I just don't know what to do anymore because I don't like saying things that might make me seem like I'm being dramatic or bratty to my parents. And they know he doesn't clean anything. They know I do it all by myself but they don't ever say anything to him. My parents are just so controlling too. They don't even let me drive anywhere out of town by myself and they sure as hell won't let me live anywhere else. I still have until December when I'll finish school that I'm still gonna have to live with my brother.

" It is amazing how the time of lunch comes so slowly. At work the time seems so relative, that I feel like I understand Einstein's theory of relativity, and I could even make my own contribution if I hadn't been so hungy. Sugar levels are dropping. Concentration diminishing.  As I correctly predicted the weekend was indeed cold and rainy and on the weather side really nasty. I have seen all types of rain on that day, and I do not care to see them that soon again. But otherwise the weekend was great. I was training my fiancee in driving on our fresh new car and on Sunday we went to see Kill Bill vol. 2 to another country and it was good.

"Getting over a girl Hello everyone, I’ve been subscribed to this sub for a while now but always been a lurker and never posted anything. I feel that this is the best place to get advice and help for what I’m going through right now...  So I’m a 19 year old guy, I’ve never had a serious relationship with a girl before.   I met this girl a few weeks ago and I instantly liked her. She’s the most amazing girl I’ve ever met. She’s funny, smart and so beautiful. We started texting/snapchatting. I told her I liked her and she said she felt the same about me. We started “talking” and we met a few times and things were going really well. Last weekend she stopped over at my house and we watched some Netflix and had such a good night with each other. I knew I was in love with this girl and I could honestly see us getting in a relationship in the future. After she left my house the following morning she started acting weird. I asked her what was wrong and she said her ex boyfriend was going crazy because she stayed over at my house. She then said she just needed to be alone for a while and that we should stop seeing each other because she still hasn’t properly got over her ex. It was so horrible, I started crying for ages and I couldn’t stop. I still feel so upset about it and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get over her. How can I get over her? I can’t stop reading our texts messaging of us saying we love each other. This is so hard. I’m crying again.

"Finished my goodbye letters. Would just like to vent a little before I hang up my hat... For the last two months I went through hell with my relationship to my GF that I was planning on proposing to right before this all began. Since May she's been telling me how she's depressed and doesn't know why and that our relationship is failing because of it. I did absolutely everything I could to help even changing so many things about myself. This went on for over a month until she said we needed to take a break which we began to and for the next month we were on and off yet still living together and in my eyes things were turning around for the better. Well, June 29th I found out the reason for all this was that she was talking to a co-worker that lives down the street and began sleeping with him while I was at work. Unfortunately I snapped and went to confront the guy which she blocked the door from me leaving and I just ripped it open hitting her with the door not even thinking bruising her shoulder. 4 days later she calls the cops and 2 days after that I'm arrested for domestic battery. We were planning a life together and I've never felt so betrayed. After a couple days I began to see the light and once I did my mother had a heart attack and I can't help but blame myself for putting her through all this stress. Normally if I had family problems I would turn to Kaitlyn my GF and if I had GF problems I would speak to my mother or my brother who lives half way across the country. Well, now I have no one to turn to and I'm spiralling out of control. Last night I spent a few hours writing my goodbyes and have been collecting a variety of sleeping pills and muscle relaxers. Im gonna try and enjoy the next couple days and then I'm pulling all my money out of the bank to go find a beautiful scenery and make that my last memory. You've always been a huge help Reddit over the last few years but this is my breaking point. If convicted which I most likely will be according to my lawyer then the rest of my life is tarnished and getting a good job will be next to impossible. Hell I'll probably lose my current job once my name begins to get drug through the mud... Idk where I'm going with this just really needed to vent to someone that isn't gonna just tell me keep your chin up and things will get better like my friends and family. They just don't understand the dark place that I'm in right now. I've dealt with what I believe to have been mild depression for about the last 15 years living in a very racist area and being half fillipino and half white. I've never truly felt like I fit in anywhere and am just tired. I'm ready for peace.

"I am new to this so please bear with me.  I don't even know where to begin.  With all of   the tragedy going on in our gulf coast as well as the war, I feel I have no right to be   unhappy but I am 24 / 7.  I am 37 years old and have made a complete mess of my life.  My parents were raised in   Europe and came to the states in their 20's.  I have a younger brother who also has   depression but it differs from my own.  When I look back at my childhood all I feel is   pain and neglect and I can't recall any happy memories.  I don't believe that I was ever   physically abused however, I do think that I was ignored and emotionally neglected.    Perhaps that is why I manage to make a mess of my life every time things seem to be going   well.  I'm married and have a 4 year old son.  From all outward appearances, my life comes   across as perfect (although we all know there is no such thing).  I have been seeing psychiatrists and therapists since I was 17 and have tried to commit   suicide on four separate occasions.  My mother suffers from depression and her mother did   as well.  This is such a long and complicated story and I don't know how much I am allowed   to write or if anyone is even interested since this is my first try in any type of chat   room.

"My wife wants another baby, I don't. Are we headed for divorce? Hi all,  I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this so let me know if it's not.  The title pretty much is why I'm here but let me give you some background.    My wife and I dated for about a year before she got pregnant.  We quickly got married and had our first girl in 2005.  In 2008 we had our son, followed by our third, another girl, in 2009.  We were crazy busy for a while there and things finally calmed down a few years ago.  We made up for that by deciding that we should move to a nicer area.  We live in Vancouver where property costs a fortune.  To afford that, my wife had to go back to work full time.  She had been working 3 days a week.  She is a teacher so she still gets the summers, Christmas and spring break at home with the kids.  She kind of half joked about having a fourth child before the move but when we moved it was clear that we couldn't afford another baby.  Now we've been in our new home for about 1.5 years.  The kids have made new friends, settled into their new school and sports teams.  Our oldest will be heading to high school next year.  Now my wife wants a new baby.  She is obsessed with it.  It's all she thinks about and all she talks about.  She says the kids are getting older and they're not going to need her soon and she's getting depressed about it.  Every couple weeks it boils over and we fight or she bursts into tears again.  I don't want another baby.  Our youngest is 8, our oldest is 12.  I don't want to go back there.  I've moved on from the baby stage and I love where we're at right now.  We are crazy busy with sports and activities most of the year (hockey x2, baseball x3, swimming, art class, etc....).  I am happy where we are, I don't feel like anything is missing, there's no hole in my life.  If we were to have another baby, we'd have to move again.  Change the kids schools again.  Have the kids meet new friends again and join new sports teams again.  I don't want to do that to them.  I've also been carrying the financial burden for the last 12 years as my wife had finally give back to work full time.  I'm not saying she wasn't working at home taking care of the kids, she was.  I am saying that if we missed a mortgage payment, that was on me and it's stressful and it's nice to have some sort on that department once again.  I don't really know what to do, I'm afraid we're headed for a divorce but that's the last thing I want.  Should I have a baby so she won't divorce me?  What if we're in the same spot eight years from now when the baby starts to grow up a bit.  I asked her if she would go speak to a counselor with me but she says it won't change her mind that she wants another baby.",0,wife want baby not headed divorce hi all not sure right sub let know not title pretty let background wife dated year got pregnant quickly got married girl son followed third girl crazy busy thing finally calmed year ago deciding nicer area live vancouver property cost fortune afford that wife work time working day week teacher get summer christmas spring break home kid kind half joked having fourth child moved clear not afford baby new home year kid new friend settled new school sport team oldest heading high school year wife want new baby obsessed it think talk about say kid getting older not going need soon getting depressed it couple week boil fight burst tear again not want baby youngest oldest not want there moved baby stage love right now crazy busy sport activity year hockey x baseball x swimming art class etc happy are not feel like missing hole life baby again change kid school again kid meet new friend join new sport team again not want them carrying financial burden year wife finally work time not saying not working home taking care kid wa saying missed mortgage payment stressful nice sort department again not really know do afraid headed divorce thing want baby not divorce me spot year baby start grow bit asked speak counselor say not change mind want baby
"Communicating is hard I'm turning 19 this year and I want to move out of my family's house in September. Mostly for my studies, but also because I simply want to move out. I already tried last year but they found a housing for young girls managed by nuns, so I lived here for a while, but I felt uneasy the whole time.  I'm heavily depressed and I had to drop out of school this year. My parents told me to come back home so that I could recover, which I did, but they don't approve of me going anywhere else to do so. For example, I feel really good in my boyfriend's family (he doesn't live with them anymore but I'm still very close to them) and wish to spend more time there, but my parents don't like the idea of not being able to give me the kind of comfort I need and find over there, so they'd rather have me stay home. I have spent as little time as possible in my parents' house recently, using every opportunity to get away, and it is understandable they don't like it. But I have always been a solitary kid, and now with my depression it became worse. I don't connect with my parents or any of my 4 siblings, and spending time with them feels like a chore. Communicating within the family is quite rough. And whenever I do try to explain how I feel, it becomes overwhelmingly clear that I'm in the wrong. It feels like whatever I say about feeling bad within the family is deflected by stating my parents and siblings' good intents. I'm sure they do mean well, but I now doubt even my own reasons for wanting anything but staying with them. I can't identify the reason why I don't feel easy with them, because they're all trying their best to help me through those tough times. I feel like an ungrateful brat.  I'm not really confrontational either. I usually obey and agree to avoid stirring conflict, but this is getting tiring.  If any of you has been in a similar situation, how can you open the dialogue? How can I tell my parents I don't feel good spending much time with them? In my family, direct family should come before everything. I also don't know how to talk about moving out and have a studio instead of being placed in a student housing, especially since my big sister (25) still lives at home despite having a job. It's not a matter of money either. I come from a middle class family and the housing my parent chose for me this year is much more expensive than a studio. Any advice would be welcomed.

"Depression and grief I am a 28 yr old M, who has been diagnosed with treatment resistant MDD from the age of 16.  Recently, I was attempting to get into a ketamine study in a NYC hospital and was asked a number of questions about my background. One item which came up that I have not thought about in a while was the specifics of my uncles suicide when I was around 13.   My uncle was a 28 yr old gay M, developed HIV and killed himself. Though this is not what I was initially told. It took around 10 years with every year or so getting a new piece of information. Initially I was told he had cancer and died. Then I was told he had cancer and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had cancer, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had HIV, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then, finally, I was told he was gay, had HIV and killed himself.  I think I secretly had an understanding of how he had killed himself even when I was a kid and was not told due to subtle hints that kids will typically pick up on. Even if I did not, I always had the feeling that something was wrong and that my parents were not truthful.  After discussing his death for two hours for the study, I realized that the depression I have been feeling for over 12 years is so similar to the feeling I get when I think of my uncle. Intense grief. I delved into the feeling more and have not been able to stop crying for the past few days about my uncle.   Does this make sense from a psychological stand point to be greiving for this long? I know there is no time limit on emotions but does it make sense for my depression to be as a result of shoving down his death and holding onto it for all this time? I would love to hear some thoughts and opinions.  I dont know exactly what I am looking for by posting this but I have really been struggling with the emotions I have been having and would appreciate some guidance and if not, some affirmation.",1,depression grief yr old m diagnosed treatment resistant mdd age recently attempting ketamine study nyc hospital asked number question background item came not thought specific uncle suicide uncle yr old gay m developed hiv killed himself not initially told took year year getting new piece information initially told cancer died told cancer grandparent pulled plug told gay cancer grandparent pulled plug told gay hiv grandparent pulled plug then finally told gay hiv killed himself think secretly understanding killed kid not told subtle hint kid typically pick on did not feeling wrong parent not truthful discussing death hour study realized depression feeling year similar feeling think uncle intense grief delved feeling not able stop cry past day uncle doe make sense psychological stand point greiving long know time limit emotion doe make sense depression result shoving death holding time love hear thought opinion dont know exactly looking posting really struggling emotion having appreciate guidance not affirmation
"How can I tell me friend that I don't want to babysit his (difficult) kid? I want to be a good friend, and there for him in case of emergencies. I've picked up his kid from daycare before when his babysitter called out on him. But then he asked me to babysit and the hours ended up being 8AM to 7PM(!). He asked me two weeks ago if I could babysit on February 3rd, and I told him I couldn't make a commitment so far in advance. (Knowing he'd have plenty of time to find a sitter). This is clearly not an emergency, and he's about to ask me again (it's a week away). I know I shouldn't have led him on at all; that it's better to be direct. But dear god, I cannot come up with the words to tell him I would rather die than spend any more time alone with his son. Last time I saw his kid, he literally threw a toy car at my face and it hit me in the mouth. He's incredibly defiant and screams bloody murder all day. He refuses to hold my hand if I take him out of the house to the park and screams and screams and I just hate that kidd!!!!!!!   I know I can't tell him how much I dislike being around his kid, and I don't want to end up hinting at this. Any suggestions on a response text? I don't want to have to keep telling him I have plans.

Anyway I got there and took the test and I failed...miserably...all day long today after that I have just became really depressed because the following things are running through my mind: - Younger kids than me pass everyday, apparently I must be f***ing retarded and worthless... All my friends passed no problem...why can't I? Why am I so stupid... Everyone had so much confidence in me and I've let them all down, I feel like I shouldn't be alive since I'm so worthless... I have only 2 more chances to pass this before I have to fill out some form saying that I'm too f***ing retarded to drive and that I need more help as I'm too stupid to try again myself...so the state has to approve my dumb a** to try again... I feel like I'm not even good enough to do anything if I can't pass some simple f***ing test that everyone else can pass...why am I so dumb? Everyone say ""It's so easy!"", ""It's not difficult, I passed my first time!"", it just makes me want to kill myself since I can't live up to the standards of this world...and may other things I just can't find words to describe...I'm not asking anyone to comfort me or make me feel better or anything, I just wanted to let this out...thanks for that...",1,read want just needed let instead bottled inside me today went took driving test time age yesand tried positive attitude day overcome nervousness got took test failedmiserablyall day long today just really depressed following thing running mind younger kid pas everyday apparently fing retarded worthless friend passed problemwhy i stupid confidence let down feel like not alive worthless chance pas form saying fing retarded drive need help stupid try myselfso state approve dumb a try again feel like not good pas simple fing test passwhy dumb say it easy it not difficult passed time just make want kill live standard worldand thing just word describei not asking comfort make feel better anything just wanted let outthanks that

"For some reason ... I am never happy anymore ... It all started a little less than a year ago. Suicide attempts, cutting, burning, hair pulling, slapping, basically just wanting to die. People tell me my life isn't that bad just because my family has money. Money isn't everything. Also, everyone spreads rumors about me, and tells me crap to my face!!! My boyfriend is really sweet and I LOVE him, but he has a serious anger issue! His psychologist diagnosed him with an anger issue. And lately when he gets frustrated, he sometimes hits me. Not like REALLY hard, but hard enough to leave a mark. Then later he doesn't remember doing it. I'm worried about him, and myself. I don't want our relationship to end because of our problems. And none of my friends understand why I cut and stuff. It's not always for attention you know!!! So, if someone could please email me at xxx. Or reply. That would be great.

Nausea/heartburn from Wellbutrin I started about a week ago and was having some reflux beforehand but only really when I drank alcohol or had something really acidic. Now I’m avoiding all that and I still have issues everyday. I know heartburn is a side effect but the weird thing is that I take it right in the morning and then at fine all day until the evening while I’m getting ready to go to bed I’m just hit with bad nausea out of no where. I avoid eating before bed as well.   Wondering if anyone else has this experience. I was maybe thinking of moving it to type evening but then I’m worried if there’s some 12 hour delay to it I’m just gunna wake up with the nausea which could be just as bad but at least it won’t effect my sleep.   Or maybe it will just go away with time since I’m still pretty early on idk but it’s really fucking with me right now ,1,nauseaheartburn wellbutrin started week ago having reflux really drank alcohol really acidic avoiding issue everyday know heartburn effect weird thing right morning fine day evening getting ready bed just hit bad nausea where avoid eating bed well wondering experience maybe thinking moving type evening worried hour delay just gunna wake nausea just bad not effect sleep maybe just away time pretty early idk really fucking right

"Long distance girlfriend's family abusive to her I'm in a long distance relationship, and my girlfriend's family totally neglects her. She has a mom, dad, and older sister.  The older sister is constantly cherished, and in her parent's eyes, does nothing wrong. My gf has to buy anything she wants, while her older sister gets everything handed to her. My gf gets almost straight A's, her older sister flunks classes. My gf's parents help pay for her sister's tuition, but kinda just shrug in her direction.

" Hopefully, you have figured out that my ""theme"" is William Shakespeare's  As You Like It . I, of course, am Rosalind, the strong-willed, independant young woman and Orlando is my lover. He left this morning and I was trying to find a way to dispense my emotions. I thought this would be much more exciting than a journal.    As I mentioned he left this morning. It is the strangest feeling for him to be so distant. Orlando holds in his chest the other half of my soul. I feel empty without him. They say ""absence makes the heart grow fonder."" I hope this is just a little bump in the cobble-stone street. We have been together for 3 years. Most couples are married by that time, but our ages keep us waiting. We are still young and must establish our careers first. I have small doubt that our love will fail, I just hope my Orlando will not be tempted by an Eve to eat (or whatever else) a forbidden fruit.   If the fruit is ""consumed"" I will be left with no other choice but to close the gates of Eden, not matter the pain. But once again, I have small doubt.

"The Irony of Loneliness in an Overpopulated World As I spend more time in the presence of depression, I've tried to apply a further focus to understand what's actually going on in my head. Dealing with the sudden appearance of depression has been a nightmare and a half to deal with to say the least. So in response, I regularly attempt to interpret the spiral of self loathing thoughts and whirlwind of emotions that march throughout my mind.   My initial reaction to a diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempts has been to run away from everything that reeks of painful memories, both theoretically and literally:  * I write this post 7,000 kilometres from my home country, in Japan, where I aim to live for the next couple of years.  * ‎I've ghosted those whom I use to call my close friends. * I left all social media in order to avoid contacting people that I knew, and because looking at how happy other people were brought me down.  * ‎I changed my image drastically over the past year as an outward expression of the fact that I'm trying to change as a person.  It's here in Japan that I've come to a terrifying realisation. I can't run from depression. Here I am, in a country where people speak a totally different language and immersed in a totally different culture to my own, writing a post about depression.   Recently, I was walking the streets in search for job opportunities when I sunk into a depressed mood and began thinking about my place in the world (which always turns out well). Nothing actually matters. We work in order to pay rent, in order to stay in the same place, so that we can reliably keep a job so that we can pay rent. It's in this meaninglessness that humans as social beings look to others for comfort. Our lives are but a meaningless speck in an expanding universe. That's quite the depressing thought... And it is. But why is it that when another body's lying on top of mine, or when I'm held in a warm embrace, this thought doesn't have any impact on me?  I've done quite a bit of thinking by myself,  and have talked to a bunch of people from back in the psychiatric ward on what 'fixes' us. And the unfortunate answer for most of us is... Nothing. We can't be fixed. It's just how our minds work. But what if we don't have to be fixed? The hardest part about depression for me, is the intensity of the loneliness I feel. When I'm at my worst, I'm so focused on my own loneliness and the meaninglessness of my relationships, that the few connections I do have, I dismiss. Now, this isn't the case for all people suffering from depression. For a lot of people, their negative emotions are driven by a sense of worthlessness,  meaninglessness or sadness.   But the general consensus is, although we can't 'fix' ourselves, we can have people around us to support us when we're at our lowest. And it makes sense that as social beings, human intimacy provides us with a safety net for when depression's hitting us the hardest.   Unfortunately for most of us, the type of physical and emotional intimacy that we strive for is unobtainable. In my life, depression's caused me to push away the people that I've spent time building connections with, and has limited the amount of contact I've had with strangers and people that I COULD connect with.  I think it's ironic. It's ironic that in such an overpopulated world, depression is such a big issue. We're the people that need intimacy the most, so you'd think we'd be in a position where intimacy is more readily available. But that's not how the world works. Our lives are still meaningless. We still hate ourselves. And we're still alone.

"Does anyone care? I have 1 friend but I haven’t physically seen them in 7 years but we FaceTime and talk every single day until recently. No big deal I’m pretty used and expect people to drift out of my life. I know people who I used to be friends with but now we are just accquantences, we don’t talk at all but follow each other on social media. But here’s the thing, when you post things on social media about how you are ready to kill your self or how depressed you are and you don’t even get a text asking if you’re okay- does that mean no one cares? I see them caring about other people but they never seen to make sure if I’m okay. I mean I don’t expect them to, but I know when I see people that I care about talking like that I need to make sure that they’re okay. I mean, how can you say you’re friends with someone but not even say anything when they’re threatening to kill the selves.

"Having a really bad stretch of days.. Hi all,  I know this sub moves kinda fast but I just wanted to vent, hopefully some of you read this..  So my story is that I've had depression and social anxiety for about 15 years or so (at least that's when I recall starting to feel ""off"".. I'm 29 now).. Because of my poor decision to bottle things up and accept that I'm unhappy I put off seeking help until about a month or two ago in which I started going to therapy. It had taken a rather bad mental fallout that occurred in early December for me to finally reach out for help.  In my sessions we've been working on techniques to combat both my SA and depression, these include going to places alone such as coffee shops, yoga classes, shopping malls, etc. (Keep in mind I have ""functioning"" social anxiety where I can physically be around people but I'm extremely uncomfortable the entire time and have a very difficult time interacting with people).. The thought process being that my depression stems from loneliness and my SA contributes to that.. It's been a big step for me to try and go out on my own, but I've been doing it almost every day even though it doesn't seem to be creating any improvement.  Unfortunately the last few days have been incredibly difficult, I'm getting a very sick feeling of hopelessness and worry that my life is now just constantly shuffling around desperately trying to find something in the world that will ""fix"" me. I tried to sit at home last night to give myself a break and I couldn't even do that, I started becoming consumed by those bad thoughts and began having a panic attack.. So I decided to just go drive aimlessly even though we were in the middle of a snow storm..  I feel miserable again today and I'm just running out of steam to keep going, I really don't know what to do anymore.. I'm exhausted from constantly forcing myself into uncomfortable public situations but at the same time my home feels like a prison.. I have nobody to talk to or gain support from anymore, the couple of friends that I have all have their own lives with wives and kids and my family has been out of my life for 10 years and for good reason.. I know nobody has answers as to what I should do but I just needed to rant ",1,having really bad stretch day hi all know sub move kinda fast just wanted vent hopefully read this story depression social anxiety year at recall starting feel off now poor decision bottle thing accept unhappy seeking help month ago started going therapy taken bad mental fallout occurred early december finally reach help session working technique combat sa depression include going place coffee shop yoga class shopping mall etc keep mind functioning social anxiety physically people extremely uncomfortable entire time difficult time interacting people thought process depression stem loneliness sa contributes that big step try own doing day doe not creating improvement unfortunately day incredibly difficult getting sick feeling hopelessness worry life just constantly shuffling desperately trying world fix me tried sit home night break not that started consumed bad thought began having panic attack decided just drive aimlessly middle snow storm feel miserable today just running steam going really not know anymore exhausted constantly forcing uncomfortable public situation time home feel like prison talk gain support anymore couple friend life wife kid family life year good reason know answer just needed rant
"It feels as if I'm heading towards a dark place Hey, haven't been here before but I had a quick scroll and this feels like the right sub to vent to. I'm 18 from the UK, I've had a rough educational life (I alway talked, went in high with my friends, got in minor trouble that kinda thing). I fucked up college in the second year of my 2 year diploma course and got excluded for the same kind of shit previously mentioned but on a larger scale, this really fucked me up as I thought I'd end up doing nothing with my life when I really wanted to do something with it. 10 weeks ago I got a job and a paid for graduates course which pays out over £1100 per month after tax which is incredible for me, it's a job I love, work hard at and it's exactly the path I want to take in life career-wise. So I've been given a second start, I have money, great friends, a good social life and my life is on track but I still can't quite feel complete. I'm very social anxious and this affects my everyday life but I push through it, I have to. I smoke week almost everyday and I've been smoking for about 5 years now. The problem is, I still have a void that I can't fill and I can never really feel that happy by myself. I love my metal and I'm a huge music fan, I used to play a lot of games but I've stopped caring so much now. Sometimes I find it hard to enjoy things as much as I used to. I feel exhausted at home as I don't sleep much and the anxiety takes it out of me until I walk through the door. It feels as if it's getting worse and I don't know what to do and I don't even know why I feel this way. Sometimes it can get quite bad where I won't even feel like doing anything but pulling bongs with the TV on in the background as the day is just too much to handle sometimes.   Sry for the huge wall of text but I'm trying to get this typed quick as I'm about to go out. I don't even know why I'm posting this really, I want to vent, maybe I want advise.

"Is there any chance of me being able to fix the friendship? Hello all,  Needing some advice on how to fix this friendship, or even if I should.  So, I met this girl at a club, and before I knew it, we became great friends. She would come round my place all the time. We would drink. Have some deep conversations on really interesting subjects. And, most importantly, laugh with each other and just hang out. Being at uni and doing the same course, she would also always try to help me when I was struggling, which was something I really appreciated.  Anyway, sometime before Christmas, I screwed up and hurt her feelings. She didn't tell me this, and I only know because I got it out of her - through text. I've tried to apologize to her before Christmas. No real luck. I wished her Happy Christmas and New Years. She did the same to me.  Now we're both back at Uni. It got awkward, as I was with my friends and she was with her friends, both sitting at the same table.   At this point, the WhatsApp conversation we had went like this:(she doesn't speak to me in person anymore or even look at me):   ...  [13:21, 1/22/2018] Me: Hi ....

"If you don't want periods (or PMS) at all there is the 3 monthly injection - Depo-provera - in the UK. It doesn't work the same for everyone (like all medicines) but for me it stopped all periods and kept my depression down to such a level that I could function ""normally"". I stopped having the 1 week mood swings, 1 week misery, 1 week mood swings, 1 week ok cycle. If that's not an option for you there is a herb supplement that I tried called Agnus Castus. It seems to have beneficial effects for most ""women's problems"" from aching breasts to full blown menopause. And it can have the side effect of weight loss (not a bad thing for me ) I was on it for ten years at a time and got to the stage where when I came off it and had a period again I had completely forgotten what they were really like! And things have wings now. The PMS didn't cause my depression but it certainly didn't help it.

"I just found my half sister &amp; half brother &amp; I'm super excited &amp; a bit down at the same time I've known for many years about them, in fact my father (whom is their father as well, different mothers) was the one that told me I had a little sister, this was when I was around 10 yrs old or so. Since then I've chosen to put them in the back of my mind. My gf had asked me if I would ever look them up or would want to meet them, I just blahhed the question. So this past Sunday morning I typed in my last name on Facebook &amp; started snooping around. Voila, there was my half brother, voila, there was my half sister. No lie, I was extremely happy, &amp; extremely sad. My father had, has, is unfaithful to my mother. Because of that reason I had no interest in meeting my half family. Now I've run into my sister, she's 24 yrs old, super smart &amp; beautiful. I messaged her, we went back &amp; forth answering each other's questions. Now we are planning on meeting for the first time before she moves away across the country. It is a very God blessed situation that I am in. I always prayed to God that I would get a sister, (I am the eldest of three from both my dad &amp; mom, all three brothers) &amp; now God said, BAM, here you go. My sister seems like she is excited as well, I hope she is. Has anyone gone through something similar, have a similar life experience ?

"Long Winded Post From a Failed 30 Year Old I don't even necessarily want to write this but I need to clear my head. I've been a depressed pissant for as long as I could remember. Some of my youngest memories are melancholic and sickly devoid of confidence or even reason.  I grew up dirt poor. I remember spending a night pushing a needle through the rubber of my shoes to get the sole back on. My mom had a stroke and an aneurysm but survived. Sort of. She became a wicked, wicked creature who loved pitting me against my sibling and I never came out on top. My entire life has been from the cowering creature perspective. Life isn't experienced but something that happens to me.  I joined the Army at 18. I had gotten recklessly married a month prior to shipping to basic. I ended up fucking up and missing a bus which led to a Lemony Snicket series of Unfortunate Events type shit. I went through partial infantry brainwashing but never made it past the build-up.  So I ended my career, the only thing I've wanted to do, before it even took off. Luckily, it was more of a ""this isn't working so we'll forget it happened"" type deal and my enlistment ended without anything terrible. But I never recovered. At least back then I had some sort of tenacity. Now? I'm a fucking shell, mate, of what I was. A completely hollow individual.  I'm 30 years old. I've no education. I have no passions. I used to enjoy writing but I can't bring myself to write anymore. The moment I try I go back into wounded animal mode. No, this isn't good enough. Nope, neither is this. Why bother? Why try? I can't help but think these things.  I'm still married and that is the only reason I haven't killed myself. I did try early on because of relentless hounding from my father in law. It is obvious I'm not what he wanted for his daughter. I can't figure out why I'm alive at all. I can barely live my life.  I'm depressed constantly. No matter how happy I know I should be or how wide I smile I'm in the grey of storm clouds that seemed, at least until this subreddit, to be only over my head. I've had so many jobs that I just explosively quit. I've got Intermittent Explosive Disorder as well as depression and anxiety. So I coil up and wind tightly before my brain dumps chemicals that make me explode with no regard for the damage done. I'm currently unemployed. I left my last job like that. I loved my job. I loved the guy I worked for. I earned several raises within a few months and was promoted quickly because I threw my back into that work.  It has been too long though. I can't seem to find another job. I can't even bring myself to apply anymore. I don't have a car. I ""rent"" a couple rooms off the main house of my inlaws. I failed so hard in giving my wife a life worth living. She spends her time working and though understands and doesn't mind my unemployment it is killing me.  On Dec.12th I lost all interest in anything. I used to escape in video games but now I can't. I load up Ark and just stare. I've anxiety about everything. Recently installed Heroes of the Storm and I played a mean Lili and Abathaur but now I've got butterflies even playing against bots. The smallest, most simple of tasks seems beyond me.  I'm stupider than I used to be. How I interpret the simplest of sentences or instruction is out of whack. I have trouble reading though I've got tons of read Omnibuses from Warhammer 40k on my bookshelf. I have trouble speaking. I talk slowly and can barely push out the words off my tongue. I'm only recently able to make phonecalls without losing my mind anxiety wise.  I'm so full of regret. I hate what I became. I hate that I married someone and am dragging them through the mud. To never have a real apartment or car. I can't hold a job. I barely take care of the house. I do dishes now but it is a real struggle.  I've been thinking a lot more about suicide and I'm already sure I am too cowardly to really do it but I think about it a lot. How it'd hurt my wife but I think it'd be good for her to find someone else. I just don't see the point in continuing. I'm an adult now but I never learned how to properly be an adult.  I don't know what to do. There is a burning hole in my chest and I feel guilty that I'm the way that I am. Even on the subreddit. I know people feel that people who've a significant other can't be as depressed but I'm swimming at the bottom of the barrel.  I want this all to end. I don't know how to survive. I don't know how people manage it. I don't have that self-preservation sense that keeps people going despite it all. I'm weak. I am weak in ways that I can barely accept.  I struggle a lot with the fact 22 veterans a day kill themselves but I'm still around. I carry endless guilt that better people die and I'm still alive. Goddamn it. People are dying from diseases and cancers while I exist. While I can't so much as go outside without feeling like all eyes are boring holes into my psyche. I hate that all I do is sit here and lay in bed. I hate myself.  I feel if I don't get this out, even if it is never seen by anyone, I will implode. I'm on medication and it helped my depression but then the reality of my life struck me and I think I'm worse off than I was. At least then I was able to lose myself in video games. Now I'm here with the stark reality. I am not meant for this world. I am too sensitive, too weak, too weak-willed, and too much of a bitch to handle life. I'll go back to lurking now.

"... being that I don't know anyone here yet, but I feel like I am about to boil out of my skin if I don't get some of this out.  Last week I left the house for the first time in nearly a month and saw my doctor about the state of my head. It was the hardest thing I have ever done (that didn't involve burying a loved one) as I was brought up to believe that one shouldn't talk about one's feelings with other people. Although the sawbones made all the right noises I don't know if he even believes me. I don't know if seeing him was the right thing to do because since walking out of his surgery all I have had is deeper anxiety, more guilt, and a feeling of total and utter desperation - I think it's actually a little worse than before. I feel like this is not going to get any better, ever. I'm scared ... I don't know how this is going to end up for me. I can't see a way out. I have been depressed for a very long time but since losing my job a little while ago I have hit the proverbial bottom. I have suffered from anxiety for many years but recently it has been getting worse - I had my first panic attack last year. It doesn't matter what I try to do to stop it, all I can think about is death, pain, more death, failure, and yet more death. I have been having horrible nightmares for months (and haven't slept properly since my teens). Long story short  (ish): when I was little the Infamous They told my parents I was 'gifted'. They had high hopes for me. I won a scholarship to a good private school, where the other little girls made fun of me. Then the scholarship ran out and I had to go to a state school. Where the other little children made fun of me, spat at me, physically attacked me and eventually my parents had to take me out of school altogether. They found a better one, where the other kids continued to make my life hell. When I was about 12 or 13  I started self harming (cutting my arms with broken light bulb glass). My mother noticed once, shouted at me, and then never raised the subject again. I continued to do it until I was about 17. My dad bullied me when I was a kid; basically he subjected me to about 15 years of mingled disinterest, public humiliation, and emotional abuse. Then he did a disappearing act three years ago - leaving my mother in financial trouble. I have not heard from him since. I have wasted my life. Nothing I have ever attempted has succeeded - really nothing, and I have never been able to please the people I was trying to please. I used to think I was a talented artist (wanted to be a comic - book artist) but now I have no self - belief left. I haven't picked up a pencil in weeks and I can't even bear to look at any of my work. I can't do anything anymore and there is nobody I can talk to - my mother is my only close family and she doesn't believe in mental illness (if I mentioned it to her she would, at best, get angry and tell me to grow up / stop being so self indulgent). I have two close friends who have their own problems to deal with. I'm seeing the doctor again on Monday but I fail to see what he can do to fix the fact that I am a useless failure. I am so scared and confused. I have been crying for about a week now and it's getting really tiring. I'm scared that maybe what I think is depression is really just an excuse to attempt to explain my pathetic behavior, that I am really a hypochondriac (my anxiety is now constant and I have convinced myself I am going to die any minute from any terminal illness you'd care to name) and I'm wasting the doc's time & resources. He offered me sleeping pills but I said no as I was afraid to have such things in the house. Basically, not a good week. Sorry to vent like this but I had to get it out  ...  sorry for being so selfish.

" I went over to my brother's yesterday evening to give him a demo of Knoppix. It was a CD which I got with my Dutch magazine PC-Active. The version is 3.3 His impression before putting the CD in was that Linux was overall much to difficult to learn, after all, he'd been using Windows since he has a PC - which is a fair few years now. When the KDE desktop appeared with working sound his face simply lit up. He didn't have to say anything, I could hear him think ""wow!"". We had a look through the main menu-structure and just ran a few programs - Mozilla, KMail, KStars, the Control Centre. He was simply impressed. I have to say, even from the CD, Knoppix is fast and reliable. He's now going to play around with the CD for a while and will probably get more enthousiastic as time goes by. In a couple of weeks (days?), I expect a request to make him a permament install on his hard-drive. He had just had a lot of virus-related problems and his windows-box had grind to a halt a couple of days ago. He was very interested in learning that with this operating system, no more of that would happen. He was also worried he wouldn't be able to do the things in Linux he did under Windows, but after showing him OpenOffice.org, this was no longer an issue.

"Medicines can and do stop working. I am going though this right now. I suffer from chronic depression. Had it since I was 5 and I am now 42 so I have been suffering for 37 years. God, I never realized how long it was! I sat in therapy for 4 years after my ex attempted to hang himself. I saved his life by taking him down from the noose with the help of my brother. The first words out of his mouth when he was out of his coma and the swelling went down was that it was all my fault. I knew then it was ME who needed the help. So for 4 years I sat in therapy and they never diagnosed me with chronic depression. If they did, they never told me or put me on medicines. When I switched therapists, that was when she said that I needed medicines. They gave me Prozac. That made a HUGE difference after the first 3 weeks. I took that for 6 years. Then I had gastric bypass surgery and when you have that, your body doesn't absorb the same so it stopped working. I took effexor for a while, did nothing, and now on celexa which is doing nothing at all. I am sitting here reading this forum and crying. So basically, medicines CAN stop working.

"My mom showed heavy favoritism to sister, and i deeply resent both of them. So, i'm 20. I’m a pretty happy, go lucky person, but whenever i think back to my childhood i instantly get depressed and cannot function. This has been haunting me for years, and i'd love to get it out in the open. But, i would like it if someone could read this and tell me, if i have legit reason to be upset about this, or if i'm overreacting?   So, in my first 6 years, i was a normal, happy kid. I had a warm, happy family. My parents were just normal, i was a little spoiled, but when your the first born, that's kind of a given, right?   But that all changed when i was 5, my mom announced she was pregnant. with another baby. At first, i was happy, i knew what was happening, since i saw it on tv before. Mom still had time for me, of course that all changed when i was 6. I was in 1st grade when she was born. Until she was born, my parents spent literally all their time with me.   Here is when the bs started. .   So, to start was her actual birth itself. It was a saturday, mom went into labor. I was in my bedroom, playing a video game. Then, during the middle of my game, i heard tires squealing, i looked out my window and saw the family car speeding off. They forgot me, i at first thought they were rushing to the corner store, since mom had some bizarre cravings, mostly for their pizza. But hours went by, i started to worry, and after almost 6 HOURS, someone came to the house to get me (my grandmother). I was kind of peeved, but my dad promised to get me ice cream, so all was settled.   So, next was the sleeping arrangement. Every night, i slept right between my parents. I never slept alone, they tried to ween me, but i wasn't particularly fond of my bed. I liked sleeping with them, because it was warm, and i've always had this ""thing"", where i have to run my fingers through someone's hair before sleeping, i kind of grew out of it, forcefully.   How? Well, i never got to share a bed with mom again, me and my dad were regulated to the guest room. Mostly because i didn't sleep alone (i never started until i was about 12). Every night after that, my mom took my sister into my spot, she said she'd come get me to come in her bed after my sister fell asleep, but guess what? She never did. Not once did i sleep with mom ever again.   We later moved in with my grandma, who only had 2 rooms. I slept with mom and sis every night, and she always pryed and forced herself between me and mom.   Come to think of it, mom never really had time for me any more, i had to start taking the bus to school. since she had no babysitter, plus dad worked.   I kind of always prefered mom, to my dad. She was a lot more fun, and creative. She made me a marble box out of popsicle sticks once. But, she kind of pawned me off on my dad after the devil child was born.   Sadly, when i was 7, my parents divorced and me, my sister, and my mom lived with my grandma.   Now, when i was 9, i had gotten involved in 4-h. I had a talent for writing and giving speeches. So, it was a big deal for me. I was the best in my class, and even made it to county competition. One of only 5 kids in my school. It was my proudest moment, since i always sucked at sports.   So, we got to the place, there were 50 people listening to me give my speech, i had my little suit, and was very proud of myself. I practiced hours a day, i wanted to go to state as well. And as soon as i get to the podium, guess who starts crying. Loud enough that everyone can hear it. My sister. So, mom had to take her out. She never saw my speech. I gave it, but i just couldn't do it right, i was on the verge of crying myself from what happened. I was too upset that she was missing it, i got a ""Participant"" ribbon, my big moment was ruined. I was gonna do it again next year, but when i wrote my speech, i had no enthusiasm for the project, and it lacked the ""zing"" the previous one had, so i didn't advance very far. I honestly didn't care anymore, mom asked about it, I told her my sister would probably ruin it.   She started growing up, and became an even more entitled little tyrant. Here we start on her as a tween. She just got so much worse.   First of all, mom really only paid attention to her. She never came in my room to come visit, at all. That's a general example, here is a more specific list.   First of all, there was one time that my pants had a hole, the pocket ripped and my wallet fell out, and I never noticed until the next day. She found it, and instead of returning it, she took $100 out of it, then returned it the next day. Worst of all, she told mom to promise not to tell me that she took it, she bought a cell phone with it. I didn't even find out until almost 10 years later.   Anytime I would try to spend time with mom, she'd always come in. I never got alone time with my mom, without her rearing her head. That was if I even got to spend time with her at all. She'd promise to spend time with me, but I’d either wait forever, and I’d be too tired to do anything. Or, she'd never show up at all.   One time, it was about 8, I asked if she wanted to play Tetris. She said she'd love to, in a few minutes. So, I loaded up Tetris, paused it and waited. Keep in mind, I couldn't really do anything else. It was nearly 2 and a half hours. She never showed, so I went to bed, I could hardly hold my eyes open. She finally did show, she got mad and said ""I thought you wanted to play?"" But, I told her ""I couldn't wait forever.""   Her excuse was that she had to wait for my sister to go to bed, because I’d get mad if she came to play too. Instead of saying ""No, I want some quality time with my son"", she just waited till absurd hours of the night, knowing I’d be too tired to play.   That was how it was any time I wanted to play with mom.   Minor story, I got a bop it toy for Christmas. She asked to borrow it and take it to school, she had to write her name on it so if it got lost, the school would know who it belonged too. She never gave it back, and about 2 weeks, her and mom were playing with it, I asked if I could have it back, and she said it was hers. I never saw it again.   One time, she broke my tv. She got the day off from school, faking being sick (I’ll get to that in a moment). While at school, she lounged around my room all day, and somehow broke my tv. I have no clue how, but it's just when I got home it was broken. She never got yelled at or punished whatsoever.   The time I got the flu. All night I had been chilled, shivering, and sick. I felt awful, I told my grandma, and she let me take the day off and would take to the doctor's office that day.   That morning, I got yelled at, accused for playing hooky. I got took to the doctor, and guess what? I was diagnosed with the flu. Mom changed her tone, and acted nice and as if she was worried the whole time. I got guilted for needing to miss a week. Then the next day, guess who got the flu? My sister.   So, she got tested. Guess what, no flu. She acted sick all morning, but as soon as mom told her she could miss school, 2 hours later, she was riding her bike and doing cart wheels in the yard. No yelling, no punishment   One time she threw my 80's, rare wrestling figures into a muddy ditch, ruining the paint job. Nothing.   There was one birthday, she got $100, my birthday came, only 75.   You know, around this time I started to watch lots of anime. I pretended I was in their worlds, it always brought me happiness. I tried to get my mom interested, but she never did. Then, one weekend, I asked her to play Mario with me, like the good old days. But, my sister showed up, with a Dragon Ball Z DVD, battle of gods movie. She asked if I wanted to watch it, I said no because I’ve seen that movie 10 times already. Mom got mad at me, and watched it with her. For 5 years I’ve been begging her to watch it with me, but she never could. I sat and watched it with them, because she said if I did, she'd play with me. She sat through the whole movie with her. So, after waiting over an hour for her to play with me. She finally showed, played one level, and went to bed because she was too tired. We'd play in the morning she said, that morning never came.   Then, my graduation. Around this time, she moved in with our dad. They all came to my graduation, but she mostly talked to her the whole time, begging her to come visit.   Also, funnily enough, I never got told congratulations or anything for graduation. She never posted how proud she was of me on Facebook, or anything. But, that same year, my sister made the honor roll. I never heard the end of it.   So, recently, last year I got an injury. and that brought on a whole slew of crap.   Most of these involve me wanting privacy for my problems and her showing up when not wanted.   First, was physical therapy. She just had to come, without even asking me, mom said yes. I told her no, I didn't want her to go. We had a huge fight, and we didn't go.   Then, was a checkup. I didn't want her to come, but she did anyway. There was no reason for her to go, they just sat in the lobby. This was a very personal thing, and I wanted as few people there as possible.   I remember mom wheeled me in, (I was in a wheelchair), and sis said she'd wait in our car. Nope, guess who walked in. Mom largely ignored me at my own appointment. Therapy and Doctor's appointments were the only time we really got together.   Then, another time I asked her to play a game with me. She actually did, then in 5 minutes, guess who called out. My sister, mom just disappeared, and never came back, so I just turned it off.   And finally, the most recent example. I actually planned on moving out. I needed a 10-dollar box. I begged and asked for weeks, and it took seemingly forever to buy me that box, but my sister asked for a 300-dollar dress, and she got it bought for her in less than a day.

"It's been almost 7 years.. 7 years.. Holy shit.. It'll be 7 years in May.. It still feels like yesterday when I got that call from your dad, telling me what happened. And I remember dropping everything I was doing at work, and rushing to the hospital. Slowly walking into the room, with your family gathered around you, that's when it hit me, and I broke down.. I lost it.. Couldn't control myself, and I couldn't stop crying. When I had to say goodbye, it broke my fucking heart.. Losing my best friend, my fiancé, was the hardest day of my life.

" i just bought a home hiv test kit from drugstore.com.  actually two.  and a bottle of wet platinum (that's stuff's yummy.  makes any session of self-love feel like you're 14 again...  but maybe that's not a good thing.  hm...)  of course, i didn't really NEED two tests nor the lube, but man i'm a sucker for bargains and i saved a whopping three cents for spending fifteen times more than i intended to.  i'm a bargain shopping stud.  the package arrived yesterday at work but i didn't want to prepare my blood sample in a shared bathroom stall.  so i thought i'd do it after a rigorous game of bowling.  and you know how much bowling gets the heart pumping and the body ready for blood sample extraction!  you basically have to prick your finger on these little plastic apparati.  of course, i was too afraid of getting pricked, so i couldn't get enough blood out of my middle finger from the shallow wound i created.  so instead, i doubled the pain by additionally having to prick my ring finger to get enough blood to fill this circle on the sample collection card.  okay, okay.  it really wasn't that bad.  i've learned to type with eight fingers quite rapidly.  no, really.  it's a lot better than getting blood taken out of your arm.  that's for sure.  the last time they did that, the nurse bruised my arm and it hurt to masturbate.  i knew i should have given the nurse my left arm...  but i'm really one big fuck up.  i just got tested a month ago.  but since then, i fucked this guy bareback and then got hit by a flu that came out of nowhere.  and this guy i screwed apparently is allergic to latex and doesn't always have safer sex with his partners.  and did i mention i already have a boyfriend?  i can deal with fucking up my own life, but when i start affecting other people's lives, i totally feel like shit and deserve more than just a couple of pin pricks on two fingers.  i can't even be straight about it.  here i am recounting my home test kit experience with witty embellishments to hide the fact that i'm a complete failure.  i can't bargain shop, i can't prick a finger, i'm a cheat, and i can't even honestly post an anonymous blog.  but at least i saved three cents.  and got free shipping.

"Girlfriend attempted to break her arm to avoid going to work My girlfriend began her summer job in a hospital earlier this summer where she mostly cleans and prepares meals for the patients. She has been pretty upfront about the fact that she is stressed during the days and doesn't want to go to work most days. Since we don't live together we see eachother about three times per week although less during summer since work prohibits that to an extent. She has never during our two year long relationship showed any signs of self harm nor depression. However, today i saw her for the first time this week and I noticed bruises on her fore arm. She unwillingly explained that she had tried to break her arm in order to not have to go to work anymore for the rest of the summer. She said that she had had a panic attack and in desperation smashed her arm into a metal pole  in order to break her arm. She promised to let me know if she felt that way again but I am not sure if she is going to. She also made me promise to not tell anyone about it.  How can I help prevent her from harming herself another time? What other things are there that I should be aware of concerning her well being?

"Hearing my parents doing naughty things at night scars me. Hey guys, my name is Sally.  I'm seventeen this year and it's 5am right now at where I live. I don't know how to phrase my words as my head is in a mess.   To provide some background story about myself, my family live in a compact flat and as a result, I sleep with my parents. In the bedroom, my parents sleep on the bed while I sleep on a mattress beside their bed. When I had nightmares when I was younger, I would squeeze in between them and only then, could I fall asleep.   As I got older, when I would replicate doing the same thing when I had nightmares, I would get scolded instead. That's how the bed was - just enough for 2 adults and 1 kid-sized human, I guess?  So I don't recall when - perhaps it was a year ago, when I heard the bed shaking continuously from my father's actions. He was also breathing heavily and there was this sticky sound too. Gross enough, I know. At that point of time, I was already mature enough to assume that he was masturbating. It was enough to scar me though, because it was just so strange to think of your dad fapping in the middle of the night, in the same room as his daughter. I pretended that I was asleep, but that was a really shitty experience tbvh. I tried to convince myself that he was doing something else, like rubbing his nose, and brushed it off. I just refused to accept that he might be doing something so dirty and it took me so many years of my life to actually realise it? What?!  Alright so today, I found out that not only does my dad engage in that sort of behaviour, so does my mum. I'm shocked lol. I don't know how I should go about knowing this. I searched for some advice on Google too, and I now learnt that it's supposed to be 'normal'? Is it so common? I'm so shooked because I thought my family were a conservative bunch. I'm their youngest child, and I thought they would have stopped all perverted acts since I was born.   So how did I find out? I suddenly woke up to hear my dad shaking the entire bed again. This time, I was really unaware and asked my dad to shut up. Suddenly, my mum nagged at me slightly and I was so confused. My mum went to the washroom and started showering? Which was so odd and made no sense. And from the corner of my eye, I saw my dad wearing his underwear and pants! He slipped them on so easily I thought it might have been a daily practice for them. He zipped up his pants naturally and it came as an instant realisation to me that both of them were engaging in some indecent shit.  What. The. Actual. Fuck. I slept in the same room with them for 17 years, and today I found out that both of them have been doing messed up shit and I was completely oblivious, up until today. It's so scarring, and I remember myself pretending I'm asleep. I knew before that my mum didn't wear a bra to sleep, but I really didn't know it might be more than just because it was more comfortable to sleep without one. Lmao.  I'm really shocked at how they are doing things like this while I'm asleep. In the same room. And my dad makes such obvious sounds, I think it's sick. The thought of it disgusts me.

" This week was somewhat of a breakthrough in the jobsearch.  I even got an offer for a job I had to refuse.  On Tuesday I got two phonecalls.  One was from Turning the Page, an organization that does professional development for teachers and connects communities to schools.  They were calling for a second interview.  The other was from Hispanic CREO, a group that advocates for school choice reforms.  They offered me a (well) paid internship until something else comes up.

"How to deal with indecisive parents? My parents are unbelievably indecisive. They make every single day about making a big decision about who moves to which country and it’s horrible.   I’ve lived in New Zealand for almost ten years now, and three years ago my dad moved back to the UK for work. Every single day my mother asks me if she and my brother should go back and join him, and if so where am I going to live?  When I was 15 I was told we were moving to Australia. I had to report this to my dean and even had to say goodbye to all my friends, only to be told (and have to sheepishly tell my friends) it was not happening after all. Now I am 21 and it does not get any easier or less embarrassing.   I was really excited when they promised to put me in a dorm at uni this year. I went to boarding school and loved it so I was really excited; my mum even took me to Briscoes looking for dorm equipment for me for Christ’s sake. They got me worked up like this for a good three months before telling me it’s not going to happen after all. I mean it would have been fine if they had not got the idea in my head.   I can not take it any more. It is mentally exhausting and I have spent the past 6-7 years feeling powerless and anxious.   Does anyone else have such indecisive parents? And if so how do you deal with the 24 hour stress that you find yourself in?   Sorry for the long post!

"My latest addiction for pain relief Cannabis and prescriptions weren't doing enough so I added gay sex with men to my regiment. I'm not even attracted to men. I just enjoy being sought after like a prize, and the way that these guys appreciate my body when I'm with them. Usually I just get massaged/played with for an hour and then give a bj in return. Feels amazing to have another human be all over me even though I can't ejaculate.   If you feel like you've given up and don't care about anything, give this a try.

"Hey, I guess this is the place to post this. I don't really know if I'm depressed and if I am I'm not sure how to go about getting help for it so I figured you guys would be able to help me out a bit. For the past year and a bit I've been feeling really out of sorts, pretty down and kind of lost in general. I left school in July 2004 and started a year out before I went to university. That's when I started feeling strange and I put it down to (and still believe it was) just a weird kind of feeling when one leaves school and their life changes forever and it's the beginning of being an adult which is a scary time for anyone. Over the year I'd go through different stages where for a few months I'd feel really positive and enjoy spending time with people and then for a few months I'd feel lonely and sad and not go out with friends for months on end. Then I went to university in September 2005 and felt very very sad. I think it was the shock of leaving home, living away from everyone I'd ever known and also the feeling of being back at school. I knew immediately that I'd made a terrible decision starting university, it wasn't what I wanted to be doing with my life and for the 6 weeks I was there I would stay in bed pretty much all day and not eat much. I think I lost about a stone and a half and even now, 3 months after dropping out and moving back home I'm still half a stone lighter than I was last summer. So now I'm back at home and I've started a job cleaning tables in a cafe where I got on with the people I work with and I'm back in the same city as my girlfriend again and things should be ok but I keep dropping into really low moods.  A few weeks ago I thought that maybe it was depression and so I took some tests on the internet with what seem to be the basic questions. I tried to answer as truthfully as possible, you have to understand that depression is not something I want to have, I've known too many silly teenagers who think that having depression makes them interesting to other people and so they exaggerate emotions to try and look sad to find it appealing. So even though I found myself answering questions that I knew were making me seem depressed I answered the anyway because it was the truth. Things like a lowered libido, I find myself wanting to have sex with my girlfriend far far less frequently than I used to and to be honest a lot of the time when I'm having sex I feel that I'm just going through the motions. My sleeping which has always been a little odd has become increasingly erratic and I've found myself thinking about death a lot. To be honest though I thought that everyone thought about death and dying and that it was natural. I fin myself becoming very easily bored with people and situations and where I once used to enjoy writing stories I can't being myself to do it anymore. The worst thing though is the mood swings I have and the low moods I find myself in quite frequently. When I feel like this I don't want to be around anyone or have anyone talk to me and I can't stop myself thinking about bad things that have happened to me or could happen on a personal level and making myself the centre of blame for them. So am I depressed or is it just, as I'm leaning towards, a natural part of growing up and finding myself in the world of work and adulthood and trying to adjust to it. And if I am depressed how do I stop myself being this way? The thought of going to my doctor and sitting there and saying ""I think I'm depressed"" doesn't make much sense to me. I've always thought that with problems of that nature you must be told that you're ill and not decide for yourself that you are. Sorry if this has been very long and poorly punctuated, I wrote it all fairly stream of consciously. Any help at all would be very much appreciated, I'm feeling pretty vulnerable and down right now and don't want to feel this way anymore.",1,hey guess place post this not really know depressed not sure getting help figured guy able help bit past year bit feeling really sort pretty kind lost general left school july started year went university started feeling strange and believe wa just weird kind feeling leaf school life change forever beginning adult scary time anyone year different stage month feel really positive enjoy spending time people month feel lonely sad not friend month end went university september felt sad think shock leaving home living away known feeling school knew immediately terrible decision starting university not wanted doing life week stay bed pretty day not eat much think lost stone half now month dropping moving home half stone lighter summer home started job cleaning table cafe got people work city girlfriend thing ok dropping really low mood week ago thought maybe depression took test internet basic question tried answer truthfully possible understand depression not want have known silly teenager think having depression make interesting people exaggerate emotion try look sad appealing answering question knew making depressed answered truth thing like lowered libido wanting sex girlfriend far far frequently used honest lot time having sex feel just going motion sleeping little odd increasingly erratic thinking death lot honest thought thought death dying natural fin easily bored people situation used enjoy writing story anymore worst thing mood swing low mood quite frequently feel like not want talk stop thinking bad thing happened happen personal level making centre blame them depressed just leaning towards natural growing finding world work adulthood trying adjust it depressed stop way thought going doctor sitting saying i think depressed doe not make sense me thought problem nature told ill not decide are sorry long poorly punctuated wrote fairly stream consciously help appreciated feeling pretty vulnerable right not want feel way anymore
"I have no idea what to do My husband and I got into an argument last night that has lasted until this morning. Through out the entire argument, he has called me horrible names and hurt me deep. I thought i was almost over my depression, I thought i was getting better, but the things he has said has taken me from where I thought I was all the way back down to extremely emotional and having suicidal thoughts.  The argument started because I was talking too loudly to his son while trying to correct his behaviour. I am 38 weeks pregnant, and lately have been easily annoyed and upset by the boy not listening to me. My husband called me a bunch of hurtful things because I tried to explain why I was so upset. Later on in the night he told me my mom and oldest sister were no longer allowed to visit me for the birth of our child. Then he spent several more hours talking about how they were ""rot gut whores"" and how he doesn't want them around HIS son all because 2 years ago my sister invited me to a christmas dinner she knew I wasnt going to show up for and didn't specifically include my husband in the invitation. Yet his mom is coming a few weeks after, and she had left him and his brother to fend for themselves in a trailer in the middle of a forest only showing up to bring them food when they called her and begged her for it. But because she ""hasn't done anything to offend"" me, he is totally ok with her showing up.  Now he's talking about how if I want my mom to be here so bad, I can leave with her when she visits. And I've fully expressed how depressed I am to him and he isn't even worried in the slightest. He just keeps refering to my past as a teen who would sleep with practically anyone to try to get some sort of pleasure out of life, saying he bets I want to go back to that, that i would treat his son better if he were black, and that i would try harder to not upset my husband if he were black.  Part of me hopes something goes REALLY wrong in the birthing process and that I will die or be put in a coma from it. I've never felt so useless, stranded, and alone in my entire life.

"My younger brother is cooler than me Hi!  So I have a bit of an embarassing truth to admit. I believe my younger brother is way cooler than me. I've never been one of the most popular people in any given situation, but I have a few close friends so it's not too bad. My brother however is one of those people that can walk into a room and immediately own it. Where my clothing style is a bit uninteresting, his is eye-catching. While I'm fairly quiet and not particularily funny, he is confident and charismatic. I get invited to parties every now and then, but he gets invited to parties every week. Oh and it doesn't help that he is taller than me nowadays.   He is not better than me at everything thankfully. For instance I'm an organised person and my grades are far above average, while his grades are far below. The point is that I'm not a cool person by any stretch but he is very popular and respected. It's silly I know, but it does hurt my pride a bit seeing as I'm older than him, and you usually expect the older sibling to have the high ground in this respect. Am I alone in this? Anyone else who have experienced something similar? :P",0,younger brother cooler hi bit embarassing truth admit believe younger brother way cooler me popular people given situation close friend not bad brother people walk room immediately it clothing style bit uninteresting eyecatching fairly quiet not particularily funny confident charismatic invited party then get invited party week oh doe not help taller nowadays not better thankfully instance organised person grade far average grade far below point not cool person stretch popular respected silly know doe hurt pride bit seeing older him usually expect older sibling high ground respect this experienced similar

"My dad died today So I’m 16, coming on 17 next month.   Today my dad died at 42.   He hasn’t been doing so well for a few days. Yesterday his legs gave out and he was stuck on the bed with his lungs in pain if he lay on his back. For 24 hours, no sleep, food, or drink. Many more problems that I cannot remember, and he’s been feeling like shit emotionally too due to family issues.   My mom went to check in on him before going to the store. Since yesterday she’s been trying to get him to go to the hospital but of course he’s stubborn. When she came back from the store, she decided she’d have the ambulance come and pick him up because he REALLY needed to go in. Slurring his words, despite actually being sober in the mornings. When she went back to get his consent over phone to get picked up for the ambulance, he was out cold already. Lips purple, cold, lifeless. It had been only 30-40 minutes since she last saw him, alive, or whatever was left of his life.   I was there to see a fresh dead corpse.   My dad. My *dad.*  To say my world is crashing around me is an understatement. I’m just a fucking kid, going through my own battles with myself and now my dad is just *gone.* I didn’t have the best relationship with him but he was a really, really good guy and this stings like a bitch.   All of it feels unreal and at the same time scarily real.   Everything is numb.   I’m lost.

"I'm 19 and tired of living I'm writing because I don't have anyone else to talk to in real life that could understand me. I'm a 19 years old girl, close to turning 20, never had a relationship in my life and only kissed a boy once. I've had boys hit one me before but I always turned them down. I feel terrible that I've never dated anyone, but in reality I don't even know what my sexuality is and I don't think that I'd be a good partner to anyone. I feel so miserable and sad all the time. I hate my body and my appearance even though I know that I'm not really ugly. I don't know why my self esteem is so low. I don't have energy anymore do anything in my life. I don't have a lot of friends and the ones that I've had in high school I don't talk much to them. I always end up isolating myself from people and the regretting it later. I don't know why I do this. I don't why I hate myself so much. I just wished that I could love myself. I think I'm depressed but I don't know for sure. I went to a psychologist a while ago and all I could do was cry and tell them how miserable I felt and they basically didn't tell me anything and it felt like a waste of money. Anyway, I don't know what I have, I just know that there's something wrong with me. I feel like I've wasted my teenage years away being socially anxious and not connecting with people, and I don't why I am like this. I just wished that I could socialize and be happy and not care so much about how I look and how others perceive me. The year is coming is to an end and I am just feeling terrible because I'm still lonely and depressed and because I'm not in college yet because I didn't study enough for the entrance exam.

" One of my biggest downfall is that I'm too emotional. I realized this today, right now, before I logged on. My ""being emotional"" is causing a big problem. You don't realize how much you love someone until they're gone. Ever heard of it? Yeah, it's the famous cliche that you never think you can relate to.. until it happens. No it hasn't happen to me but I feel that I'm getting close and it hurts. I don't want to give up but what if he has? What if he's just ""over it""? You know that could be it. I'm all messed up. I should have stuck to the idea that he's too good for me. I told him from the beginning that I'm no good for him but he wouldn't listen. He just wanted what he couldn't have and now he has it he doesn't want it. Why? I'm mean, why do people function like this? I have to admit, I don't exclude myself from this terrible disease. But why? Why do people always want what they can't have? Because it's challenging. That's it.  I need some alone time. Some time to think things through. When I told him yesterday that the longer we are together the more scared I get, I did mean the more scared I get to lose him but as I was thinking today, I think I am scared. I don't know of what because I've been wanting this for so long now. After I got baptized, this just became more real than ever. This is it Antoinette. This is all for real. No joke. So what's so scary about that? I guess this is what they call cold feet. This is the time that the questions start rolling in. Do I really want to tie down so soon? Can I help make it work FOREVER? Will the love last FOREVER? Do I really love him? Does he really love me? Is this really love? Are these even questions you bring up in a deep, deep conversation? Am I being too emotional? I need some alone time. Some time to think things through because this is for real. No joke. I want to do the right thing because deep down inside my little heart, it sure feels like the right thing.

" Hmm, lol. Well, I cant really say that this is my first time writing a blog, I have done it before, but failed miserabley! :(  My other site that I was running and maintaining sorta died, when dot.tk decided to kick me off for not having like a gazillion visitors a month, OH, and because my account was free!! :P   Well, I better start writing about yesterday. Well, ( this is gonna be interesting :P) I worked from 4pm-9pm, and had like a 10 min break at about, 8:25pm. Since I had to ride to work, coz my brother was being a wanker and didn't wanna drive me, i parked my bike around the back of the building, ( without a chain ) which i forgot. So at about 8:30pm I decided that i would check if my bike was still around the back of the building where i parked it. Well, to cut an EXTREMELY long story short, it wasn't and after alot of screaming, and alot of profanities being used, i ended up vending my anger into the nearest wall, which happened to be concrete. It would've been alot better if it had been marshmallow or something, otherwise I wouldn't have like a knuckle the size of Kansas at the moment now would I!? :D   After this, I went back inside, and worked the next 30 min till i finished. My Mum picked me up, and thought that since I rode to work, she would be picking up the bike aswell, but no! After an extremely heated discussion, ( more like we were ripping eachothers heads off ) we decided to go down to the police station, ( about 15 min drive awa ) and report the bike stolen. When we were reporting the details to the nice constable, he immediately jerked his head up and said "" oh, is this yours??"" I then had to walk down a long hallway, and he then revealed the bike, and to my joy, I replied "" yes, yes that is my bike ""  Since Mum had gone home to get changed, because when she picked me up she was in her SLIPPERS!!! We now had the smaller car, because Mum believed that we had no chance in the world of finding my bike!! We had to really cram my 21"" bike into the little family car!!  I went home and SLEPT!!!

"I am a 31 year old mom of 5. I have a 25 year history of anxiety, depression and OCD. I have spent years of my life trying antidepressant drugs and anti anxiety medications to help with the symptoms but I have been labeled treatment resistant. I either have side effects that I can't tolerate off of the drugs or they just don't work for me.  I walk around every single day either feeling lifeless, numb, helpless, angry or detached from my family. I have no support from my family as I am estranged from my abusive parents and my sisters are not interested in my emotional problems. To make matters worse I suffer from seizures, migraines and asthma which cause me to be prone to bronchitis and pneumonia. I spend a lot of time sick and in pain.  I have five kids to raise. Two of them are disabled. They have severe speech disorders that make them behave in a negative way. It makes me feel frustrated. My oldest daughter has problems in school because she is having problems with her vision. She may have dyslexia.  I never get out of the house except to go to Walmart or the grocery store. I can't drive because of my seizures and my husband never keeps a consistent schedule. I am housebound and lonely. I see a therapist when I can and he has actually told me he is amazed I haven't killed myself by now with the stress I am under. I am burnt out and sinking fast. Does anyone have any good advice for me?  I do not have a support network so forget about that. I can't make it to support groups so that is out. I am alone except for my children and my computer addicted husband. Please help me figure out how to cope with my life.

"I think i'm okay, but in reality and in hindsight I am completely not okay. I think I am literally dying day by day. Hello to anyone out there,  I'm just a good guy who didn't come from much and I'm trying my best to live a fulfilling life but I don't think I can anymore because of this illness. I use to be quite a geek as a kid and love video games and playing with others and having fun. I remember when I use to look forward to coming home from elementary school or middle school and just do my homework and then game away. It was so much fun then and I felt like I was genuinely pretty happy. Now a days I feel like i'm just literally dead. I don't do anything, I can't sleep, I hardly eat because I cant find the motivation to go out and get food... and over the past 4 years I have noticed that depression really has taken a toll on me mentally and physically.  It sucks so bad that I genuinely think I will probably die prematurely and die lonely. I have no friends, no acquaintances, and just family that don't understand anything about what i'm going through. To be honest I wish I was never born. I wish i didn't exist because facing the world is killing me.  Just the other day I thought about all the opportunities i've missed out on because of my depression. Like internships, jobs, career fairs, fun events and even a potential awesome friend but all of that isn't going to happen because i am as dead as a rock.  I turned 22 a couple days ago and no one even said happy birthday...Not even family. At this point i'm looking at my future and its looking dim.  I've simply lost the meaning of living. I have no self esteem, no confidence, nothing. Maybe people like me don't deserve to live a good life, perhaps we ought to die and just get over it.  If there was someone who can tell me my fate i'll want to listen to it now. I just can't anymore. I fucking just want to run the bridge and jump off but sadly i recognize that I only have one life. I'm hoping and hoping maybe everything can turn around for me but what are the odds to be honest.  I might as well have a heart attack and just die. I hate this. I'm lonely, i'm always sad and i'm just a piece of shit that is worthless.  Good Bye everyone. I hope you've all had an awesome day. As for me everyday is the same and if things don't change soon I think i'll rather end it. Not even graduating college meant anything for me. I fucking hate myself!

"Depression never ends does it?  You take the Paxil or whatever pill they prescribe.  You take it for years and years and every day you still feel so down and lonely and empty inside.   I'm sick of being sick.  I'm tired of being tired.  I don't know for sure if I want to kill myself or not.  I've made several attempts at it but then sometimes I think I don't really want to die I just want this life to get better.  Some people have ""normal"" lives don't they?  Why do they have normal lives, and what the heck is wrong with me?  Why can't I just snap out of it someday and be someone productive!?!?!   I HATE MYSELF, I hate the way I've made my life.

"Made grandma feel old XD Setting of this story is morbid but this is my favorite memory with my grammy.  I'm about to turn 22 and this took place back in November of 2017. My family lives all along Western Washington and we don't see each other often, so it was bittersweet to see everyone at my great grandmothers funeral. My cousins and I sat together at one end of the table when we all went to lunch after at a fancy restaurant with our moms next and then grandparents. Only two of us kids are old enough to drink, me and my 28 year old cousin. No one blinked an eye when he ordered an Irish coffee. But then the baby (me) ordered a rum and coke.  This resulted in two things. 1. My mom and cousin laughing at me because my original order was for Southern Comfort and coke and they said I drink  poor people booze (I'm 21 fresh out of college what do you expect) 2. My grandmother nearly had a heart attack when she even heard me utter that I wanted alcohol.  What made this even funnier was when I got my drink and she mentioned to my mom how she keeps forgetting I'm not 16 anymore.",0,grandma feel old xd setting story morbid favorite memory grammy turn took place november family life western washington not often bittersweet great grandmother funeral cousin sat end table went lunch fancy restaurant mom grandparent kid old drink year old cousin blinked eye ordered irish coffee baby me ordered rum coke resulted thing mom cousin laughing original order southern comfort coke said drink poor people booze i fresh college expect grandmother nearly heart attack heard utter wanted alcohol funnier got drink mentioned mom keep forgetting not anymore
"I Feel Lonely and Scared I'll End Up Friendless. Need an Ear. Ive come to the realization that I'm really scared I'll end up with no friends. I used to be the type who kept in touch with friends for years. But, I have either lost touch with or outgrown every friend I had in high school.   The new ones I made in college are nice people for the most part and ended up being my roommate group (since sophomore year. I'm a 2nd semester junior.). But every friend group has their faults. And with this one, I don't feel like I fit in completely.   4 out of the 7 of them are know-it-alls who will try to correct you on every little thing (like one time I was exaggerating and saying somewhere had 100x more people, and one of them came out of their room and said ""Um, I think it's actually 1000x more people."") Those 4 are also really uptight, don't get my sense of humor for the most part and seem like they're always trying to school me on what's appropriate (MIND YOU I NEVER JOKE ABOUT RACE OR OPPRESSED GROUPS OR ANYTHING OFF LIMITS LIKE THAT.). I just don't always feel seen or appreciated or like my intelligence is respected. There's also one I don't even like that much (no matter how much I've tried) because she has an arrogant, self-aggrandizing, my-way-or-highway attitude.   The point is I don't always feel in sync with them. Even the ones I do feel in sync with, I don't feel like they reach out to me nearly as much as I reach out them (when we're not in school). And I don't like one-sided friendships. I'm worried we won't stay friends after undergrad.   Also this year, 2 of them are graduating and I have to find a new roommate to fill in the spot that'll be in my room. I'll admit, I didn't make enough effort to hang out with people outside of my dorm, and everyone had settled into their friend groups so it's harder to make friends now with the people at my school. I don't know what to do.   Part of me feels this is my fault for not getting a single in the first place, and trying to join this friend group when it was already established. They eventually came to see me as a member, and we've had good times but I don't know that these are ""my people"".  And part of me wants to get a single room next year, but I feel like I'll just be jumpstarting my social isolation and I'm also scaredy new roommates might be lunatics.   Tl;dr - I've lost touch/outgrown my high school friends, don't fit in with my college friends, and am scared to end up alone without any friends. Need advice.

My dad suffers from bad anxiety and most likely depression for the past 3 weeks he got some panic attacks one leading to him calling the ambulance (thinking he was getting a heart attack)  I know for a fact that this has been passed down to me to. I also suffer from anxiety  but i learned more to deal with it now. But  times like this it gets a little harder.

"Close friend suddenly turned cold I have a friend who's had some mental and anxiety issues in the past. We generally chat online, although we've met up in real life a number of times, and talk on the phone sporadically.  They have an issue with trust. They believe no one cares about them and that every friend they have will eventually leave them. So fairly insecure. They are currently attending therapy (have for a number of months) to help them with their anxiety. They are meditating etc.   At a certain point I stepped up and decided, 'Okay, if they truly believe this about themselves, that people always leave them, I'm going to be the person who doesn't.' For the record, I know of a mutual friend who did push this person randomly out of their life—so as far as I know, it's not a lie.  Anyway, I stepped up because I thought this person was pretty special and intelligent. I loved that they were passionate and outspoken and unique. Over time, I developed some feelings for them too but more a great love as a friend than anything too romantic.   Anyhow, we grew close. We shared many things, pretty much every day, although I believe she feared that she was abusing the friendship because I would try and reassure her a lot. She asked for my advice, and I gave it without thought. When she was upset, I tried my best to calm her down and express care. When she needed a boost, I gave it to her. She was worth my time. And she did the same for me. Because she was going through a hard time in general, I did all this because she was who she was.  Then...we had a couple of fights. Nothing horrible, and we supposedly worked through our problems but...I've been having my own issues recently. After the last fight, where we talked everything out on the phone and she expressed the qualities she liked about me, as a friend, and how she was afraid that doing so in the past had pushed people away...well.  Now, she's cold and distant. Not 100%, but there's something sincerely off, enough to notice. Phrasing that you wouldn’t use with a friend, let alone an acquaintance. I have years and years of examples to the contrary and I’ve asked a therapist friend to have a look at the differences as well. She’s definitely changed; it's definitely not just me.  Supposedly, she’s looking after her mental health. I can see how having a person there to always reassure them may lead to this person not being as eager or able to rely on themselves, but we could have worked this out. I would have supported them through it. My support was enough up until three weeks ago when something quite major occurred and upset them. Now, I get ‘Well, I suppose that’s very kind of you’ when I express concern for how she is and ‘How do I know that you’re not rolling your eyes?’ when I express that I care and ‘What possible use could I be to you’ when I tried to give her a little advice and express that she's important to me too. These are all usual parts of the conversation and nothing out of the ordinary from my side.  Her manner and actions are a huge backflip, because less than a month ago she expressed how important and vital my friendship was to her because she—definitively—knew I cared about her (and suspected others didn’t). She also stated that she was going to be a better friend. Now I hear ‘I need balance in my life’, as if it was a major issue to be close to someone. The two things—better mental health/developing more of an ability to take care of oneself *and* having someone close to confide in—are not mutually exclusive.  I’ve lost a decent amount of sleep over this because the support was reciprocal, so it feels like I've lost a large part of my support network. I’m looking for any opinions on what I should do here, because I’m hurting and it’s already been a bad time (of which this person is aware). I've already asked them twice what's up and the question has been turned on me both times, as if I'm the one with the issue.   I don't want to cut them off because they really do mean a hell of a lot to me, but is that all I can do here? I've tried to just back way off for the moment and see if they realise what they've done on their own.  P.S. This is a six-year friendship.

My gf is planning on killing herself and idk what to do... Ok so me and her have known each other for 9 months. We are in a long-distance relationship. We have never met in real life. I think she may be bipolar. One night she told me she cut herself a little bit. On her thigh. At first I thought she was joking. She showed me the mark if lefted in the morning and I knew it was serious. She is 16 and I am 18. She has told me before she wants to die. She has had a bad past with men but I won't go into any details. It was just really bad. She doesn't talk to her parents about it just me. Her mother and father may get a divorce so that makes this situation even worse. She can be really happy at times then really down. We get in fights sometimes but they are usually resolved. She always complains she is a bad gf because she treats me like shit. I forgive her for doing so because of her shit life. Today we were just talking casually and a few mins later she said I will kms on said date. Then I told her why would u. She said love u bye. We then went back and forth until I decided to leave her alone. She said she wasn't feeling ok. But I have never heard her give me a date before. Saying you will is one thing but a date means you have planned out how u want to go. I didn't tell my parents the full story and neither has she. She has tried killing herself before. I didn't know her at the time. She doesn't have any friends in real life and the ones she does have just use her. She is also behind in school which stresses her out. I will go into more details if anyone is willing to help me and thank u for hearing me out.,1,gf planning killing idk do ok known month longdistance relationship met real life think bipolar night told cut little bit thigh thought joking showed mark lefted morning knew serious told want die bad past men not detail just really bad doe not talk parent just me mother father divorce make situation worse really happy time really down fight usually resolved complains bad gf treat like shit forgive doing shit life today just talking casually min later said km said date told u said love u bye went forth decided leave alone said not feeling ok heard date before saying thing date mean planned u want go did not tell parent story she tried killing before did not know time doe not friend real life one doe just use her school stress out detail willing help thank u hearing out
"Intense feelings of not wanting to exist/ wanting to escape and be alone somewhere forever I'm a first year in university and have suffered from depression since middle school. I've been able to manage my depression by having really supportive friends and through that, felt like I had a purpose in life. However now entering university, I feel like I have no purpose, no reason to exist and it is a lot harder managing my depression. I fill up my time with work and sports and stuff as a way to distract myself, but I just feel like I am going through the motions of life and everything just feels hallow. I think dying is such a pleasant and peaceful idea and am totally okay with it. I feel like I don't have any actual friends even though I go out a lot, and I feel like I have no impact on other people's lives, like they can go on so easily without me being there.   On top of that, I feel like I don't belong anywhere since leaving highschool. I feel like I don't have a place in college, even though I got into my first choice school. However, I am too afraid to drop out because that lifestyle seems even more daunting. I really want to go someplace where I can live out my life in seclusion and just get away from anything.

"I'm losing my mind and don't know where to put it for safe keeping. If only I could just put it in a little box, wait for the insanity to subside and then take it out and it would be unharmed. Lately I feel as though I've been more crazy than usual. I can't stand human contact, not just from my wife, but from anyone, a handshake, a hug, anything. I just tense up and can't breathe. What the **** is wrong with me? Yet I lay in bed wanting her to hold me, but when she does, I can't breath, it has nothing to do with how she is cuddling up against me, it's just how I start to feel. I hate feeling like this because it makes her feel like she is less than desirable or that she did something wrong. She didn't. I still love her. I need her. I'd be dead w/o her that's for sure. The good doctor is on vacation this week, I may leave her a message about this latest 'issue' just because I know myself. I won't bring it up next time I see her and then it will continue to bother me. It's like I need to go in w/ a list pinned on my shirt of things I'd really like to talk about. Because I get there and I can't speak. And I hate the awkwardness of sitting there, staring into someone's eyes, knowing there are things you should be saying but you can't. I'll get over it.

I Could Use Some Support Right Now Yesterday my best friend of five years attempted to kill their self. I'm currently being blown away by school (grad school if it really matters). I don't know what to think at all. This is midterm week and most my profs are understanding but the one class I'm worried about the prof gave me the option of writing and being stuck with whatever mark I get or not writing and the weight being shifted onto my final but I need the feedback to decide if I'm going to even stay in the course because it's incredibly difficult. It just feels like nothing is going my way currently and it's so hard to study or focus. side note; another prof let me write as  told them (like I did the other) that I wanted it as a distraction and said that if I did bad they'd shift the weight to my final. ,1,use support right yesterday best friend year attempted kill self currently blown away school grad school really matter not know think all midterm week prof understanding class worried prof gave option writing stuck mark not writing weight shifted final need feedback decide going stay course incredibly difficult just feel like going way currently hard study focus note prof let write told like did other wanted distraction said did bad shift weight final
"My family might break apart... Sorry this is a long post. Yes I know this is common thing sadly. But I don’t want it to, 12 years my family have been together.  Just to start off, There is me, my brother, my dad and mum.  So my dad has anger issues. His parents never told him it was wrong so he has been like this all his life. Our mum is his second wife because his first wife divorced him for all the reasons I’m about to mention. We only listen to him because he rules out of fear, he isn’t teaching us anything, and is a bad influence on us. When he gets annoyed he yells really loudly on purpose for everyone to hear (including our neighbours) then drives off for an hour. He’s always threatening to me and my brother, “I’LL KICK YOU IN THE FACE”, “YOU’LL END UP IN HOSPITAL.” I’ve despised him for about 3 weeks and it’s actually a lot better when he drives off and vanishes. Problem is, he makes 80% of our money.  My brother is slowly becoming like my dad.I’m trying to help him, my mum is trying to help him but it isn’t working. I believe he can still change because he’s still young (12). He yells at our parents trying to prove he is right all the time. Problem is, he won’t listen to us unless our dad threatens him and scares him into stopping. Heres the big problem, he is a messy person and our mum is a very tidy person, she tells him all the time clean up but he says, “I’ll do it later”, but never actually does it. So my mum and brother argue often about this. He says he doesn’t care about who he is becoming, but I know he does. Despite all the tension between me and my brother I still love him very much.   My mum is the only reason our family is still together. She ends up stopping dad from slapping/threatening us and is the one that teaches me and my brother right from wrong. She’s basically carrying our whole family and I feel bad about it. I love her very much and I feel so much empathy for her. She was a good daughter and this is the life she grew up for. It’s sad, really.  And me, I was also becoming like my dad, but ever since Mid 2017 I’ve had a fear of me or my brother becoming like him in the future. I’m using my words, I’m trying not to yell. I’m trying not to walk off after every arguement so I can tame my temper. I’ve slipped a few times, but this fear is actually changing me for the better. I’m telling my brother not to answer back to our parents but he won’t listen. I’m trying to help my mum because I feel sorry for her. So recently, it’s me and my mum trying to stop my brother from yelling at us, stopping our dad threating/slapping us. I’m trying to get my brother to see the future like me.   So just yesterday, my brother made a light-hearted joke to my dad and he got mad and slapped him. Later that evening, our mum asked him why he did that. So he drove off and came back at 1am. After this, our mum and dad haven’t spoken to each other. This morning my brother keeps arguing his point to our mum, I try to support her. My dad has done nothing. All he did was wake up, drove off and come back at 7:30pm to sleep, then he drove off again. So just a few hours ago, my mum tells my brother to clean up. This causes a arguement. I support mum, but my brother won’t stop yelling. I told him to stop 3 times but he told me, “You don’t have the authority to tel me to do anything”.  After this my mum asks me, “what should we do now?” Then I messaged my brother and things have been solved between us.   Thats too much arguements for just 2 days, don’t you think?  And my mum is right, what can we do?   There’s too much problems with all of us, and we’re all depending on each other so it’s not easy. My mum would’ve divorced dad long ago if she had the money.  I want me, my brother and mum to live together peacefully away from the bad influence of our dad.  We haven’t called the authorities because my mum is afraid of what will happen to our dad. We haven’t got outside help because our parents think it’s embarassing.  So, what choices do we have?

"I used to be so creative, and funny I used to enjoy writing, drawing and making people laugh. Now I'm just a shell of self hatred, and constant doubt. My social skills are out the window, I'm always awkward. I used to write short stories, and I haven't done that in several years. My drawing skills haven't advanced since I was a teen, which is is sad because if I had continued drawing, I would of been a lot better than I am now I bet. :/ I'm trying to slowly build up my artistic love by using adult coloring books, and doodling models.   I've become so engulfed with my appearance (I have BDD and anxiety and depression) that I completely abandoned all other parts of my personality that made me special and interesting.

"Need advice on helping a friend escape an abusive dad A week ago, my best friend Jake (not his real name) confided in me that he has been physically and emotionally abused by his father since childhood. We are both 17 years old and we have been best friends for 4 years. I was really shocked when I found out because everyone in our high school friend circle sees him as extremely seemingly cheerful and upbeat. I'm his best friend, and I never suspected anything was wrong.  This morning, he texted me saying that he was running away from home. He told me he left his home with a backpack full of clothes and $100 that he had secretly saved up without his dad's knowledge. I'm very worried about him. On the one hand, I think he should get out of that dangerous situation as soon as possible. On the other hand, I think it will be very difficult for him to survive on his own with so little money. Any advice on how I could help him as a friend?

"For those on antidepressants, is it working? Alternatives to antidepressants? Okay so I’m going back to a psychiatrist next week for my depression. I’ve been going since high school and over the years have had depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, lack of motivation and interest, high anxiety, numbness, hopelessness, etc etc. recently it’s been coming back.  I’ve been on Zoloft which made me feel like a numb zombie and bupropion which I didn’t feel was working. I’ve also tried Xanax (made me calmer but high) and a mood stabilizer that didn’t really help. I’ve since gotten off medication by my own choice but the problems are coming back. Generally I don’t like rx drugs and would rather do it naturally but it’s not going away.  My question to people is what antidepressants have worked, how long have u been using them, and has ur depression improved? Should I take it for the long term? And what alternative methods have worked for you guys?",1,antidepressant working alternative antidepressant okay going psychiatrist week depression going high school year depressive thought suicidal ideation lack motivation interest high anxiety numbness hopelessness etc recently coming back zoloft feel like numb zombie bupropion did not feel working tried xanax made calmer high mood stabilizer did not really help gotten medication choice problem coming back generally not like rx drug naturally not going away question people antidepressant worked long u using them ur depression improved long term alternative method worked guy

At the end of the day, The Glory Hole is all about hilarity and friendship, nevertheless, if you are easily offended, this probably isn’t the place for you.      **What’s with the Theme?**   Our server’s theme is a fun piece of window dressing that allows a colourful hierarchy of roles for users to work towards via their activity in the server. We may be a hole in the wall, but we are a classy one at that :p      **General Life?**   The server consists of text, media, and voice channels where users share their interests, pets, favourite videos, etc, and have discussions of all varieties. Most of the action happens in the voice channels however, where we have rooms for watching movies, listening to music, and playing video games in addition to large rooms for rowdy discussions and smaller rooms for more quiet conversations. Sometimes we’re all in a big room together, chilling out as we play video games, and other times we splinter off into separate rooms to partake in differing activities.   Once a week however we host a planned movie event where users make suggestions, cast votes, and hold screenings of their favourite films.

"My First Real Episode Hey guys... I just really need to word soup to get things out that have been on my mind that I have not shared with anyone close to me, I feel as if this is the only way to fight this feeling of sadness.    So to start everything off, I never thought that I would be typing these words as I am now. Not to say that I'm ashamed of it, but just because I never felt I had anyone to share with. I never have felt like I was able to confide in my close friends or family because I don't want them to carry the burden of my troubles, and I used to feel like it would just be a form of attention seeking to try and explain to others how I feel sometimes.    With that being said, I feel as if I truly hit my lowest of lows about an hour ago and the sad thing is that I cannot really describe the feeling... because all it felt like was just a severe sense of nothingness. I felt as if I was experiencing an out of body sensation, and my mind could not calculate any sense of emotion besides this feeling of dread that was accompanied by a warmth-like feeling starting from the back of my brain and slowly taking over my head.    It's been happening a lot lately during the night... especially since I've been moderately sick lately and it feels like my body is giving up on me no matter what I try... eating healthy and exercising only takes away the feelings of loneliness and sickness a little bit. What really helps is interaction with others, whether it be watching live programs or being on xbox talking to people or being in chat rooms because it gives me a small sense of community and belonging that I lose when my mind is left alone to itself.     I know it sounds stupid, but lately I've just been envisioning my feelings as the mind flayer monster from Stranger Things because it helps me make a little more sense of everything to a degree when I envision the feelings as something physical... I just wish it was a bit easier to find the focal point/issue that makes me this way to improve not only my life but also the lives of others around me.

"Advice To preface this, I wanna say that I feel pathetic/incompetent/exhausted.  Female, 30, currently staying at a hotel because I had to leave the house I was living in because of a conflict that recently happened. I got into a verbal argument with my sister (34) that resulted into a physical altercation. She screamed ""Go kill yourself"" and then shoved me and scratched me. My father was a witness to this. I then called the cops because i felt unsafe, she got so angry and turned a bit violent. (This is the third time she's told me to go kill myself and my parents haven't told her anything). Right before the cops came she was arguing with my dad and told me to ""Shut the f*** up!   The cops arrived I told one of the cops my side of the story and she told hers. She said that I attacked her and that there were scratch marks on both her arms. I told the cops how could that be when none of the nails on my right hand are very short (I swear to you I couldn't have scratched seeing since I had no nails on one hand. The nails on my right hand are VERY short because they all broke due to cleaning the kitchen cabinets etc). The cops didn't believe me. My sister also claimed that I'm ""bipolar"" which I'm not. So the cops believed my sister and took me away on a 5150. I was released 3 hours later because the case manager said I didn't have any mental health issues.   The funny thing is that I told my parents that I wanted permission to use their car to leave that house because I couldn't handle the stress that came with living with her. I would eventually return the car once I moved, got myself established etc. The stress has caused me to lose 3 pounds this week alone.   After returning from the behavior health services, I gathered  my bag and one suitcase and left. Currently, I'm staying at a hotel.   What hurts most of all is that my parents have never told my sister to stop telling me to kill myself. It's as if thy don't care. This is such a shitty experience that I wouldn't wish upon anyone.   I'm a hotel with no car, no friends, no home.   Is it bad that to think that I just wanted my parents to tell her to stop telling me to kill myself. I feel like I'm asking for a lot.

" I need a job. A paying one. Not another unpaid internship where I drive 1.5 hours to get there, do crap work for 5 hours, then drive 1.5 hours to get home.   LA traffic sucks, but at least it's not as bad as Houston traffic. Or rather the drivers aren't nearly as bad. People here pretty much know how to drive. Houstonians DO NOT. They suck. They are rubberneckers to the Nth degree and cut you off and give you the finger. Here, people are calm for the most part and just sit and wait. Much nicer and more stress free.  I like it here. Maybe it's being away from family and friends that I grew up with or something but I think the only way I'll ever have a life of my own is out here. Just being around my family (who honestly are the *best* family anyone could ever hope for) makes me feel all this pressure to be someone or something. I feel like a different kind of person than them and no one has ever really made any effort to ""get"" me. I'm creative, they're not. They're obsessed with sports, I'm obsessed with tv and movies. When I'm with them I'm down on myself for not being about to get married like my cousins, or because I haven't been seeing the same person for 4 years like my YOUNGER brother. Going home to spend time with them is great, but it always makes me feel like my life is missing something because I'm not like them.   Out here, I fit in. Everyone's creative, everyone's obsessed with tv and movies. People out here have traveled and lived all over. They don't grow up in one town and marry someone they went to high school with.

"Well I'm getting ready to go back to school so I'm trying to get sober for a while and see i can clear my head. So far I've been sober for about days and i must say I'm not feeling any better. Some of the problem is probably zyrtec which I'm taking for my allergies but really i just feel really irritable and confused. i can't really think too well and it's making me want to drink. Drinking slows down my mind somewhat so i can focus on things in my head. Normally its not till the next day after a good night of drinking that i feel good for most of the next day. i am more talkative and can come up with things much easier. There are people who use Prozac and other anti-depressant drugs not because they want it but because it makes them feel even better than they normally do. This is somewhat my issue with alcohol however i don't fell good normally i feel like s**t normally. i guess i should let u in on what is really bothering me. First ill just list the problems i have i find most worrying. Night blindness ""fuzzy vision"" bad sinus pressure moderate fatigue all the time short term memory problems random aches and pains major depression, anxiety, and ocd bad allergies acid reflux. To be honest most scary one is night blindness. Trying to explain is pretty difficult but ill try. It's like being able to see all the cons and rods and your eye flash on and off constantly kind of like a bad channel on a TV screen. I've had it for years now with no one who can really give me straight answer about it. i went to my doctor recently and got up the nerve to tell him but thought he gave me some good info he probably thought i was mad. Anyway one of the first things your body will do when it's over exerted is give u fuzzy vision. Now normally night blindness is caused be a vitamin A deficiency. Maybe there is something wrong with my stomach that is making me feel the way i am and i did have kidney stone when i was 2 which is very rare. i know this is a lot of information but this is what i deal with on a ""daily"" basis. My daily routine is almost exactly the same except on weekends when i do go out and drink with my friends. my will is low and energy just as low so i find myself kind of in and out of this trance that is supposed to be life. Each day i go to work, come home, eat, and up to my room for pretty much the rest of the night. don't get me wrong i do other things during the week sometimes but i feel most comfortable by myself in my room as opposed to human contact which sucks. So if i have to drink to keep from going over the deep end then i will do so until i get some real answers.

As I was driving home from work today I was thinking about who to take, and I came up blank. No one came to mind. I have my roommates, but I don't really talk to them much and they all have girlfriends that they hang out with all the time anyway. Even the ones I went to high school with. I realized the other day when they mentioned it in passing that they had started a new DnD campaign with a new guy. I'm never invited to dinners or anything anymore. We never make a big ass meal together on Saturday anymore. Honestly, I don't think they'd even want to go anyway.   There's no one else I'd ask. Everyone at work is either dating someone or I don't know them well enough. I'm taking online classes so no one there either. I don't do anything outside of school or work.   I don't even have any friends to take to this fucking symphony. Not even one. I identify more with the characters in the books I read than with anyone I know. I don't know what to do. I feel so alone. I'm not even that close with my family, not really. Not well enough that I can even really talk about my opinions and especially not my emotions.   The therapist I saw about a year ago kinda threw me off as SAD and said it'd get better. I just dunno what to do.",1,today realized not friend not really weekend going harry potter symphony aunt grandma live together got sick gave ticket told friend not want chance getting sick staying mom fair enough driving home work today thinking take came blank came mind roommate not really talk girlfriend hang time anyway one went high school with realized day mentioned passing started new dnd campaign new guy invited dinner anymore make big as meal saturday anymore honestly not think want anyway ask work dating not know enough taking online class either not outside school work not friend fucking symphony not one identify character book read know not know do feel alone not close family not really not really talk opinion especially not emotion therapist saw year ago kinda threw sad said better just dunno do
"Hello everyone. My name is Amy. I discovered this page just by searching on the internet for depression forums. One good thing about me, I believe, is that I'm very mature for my age. I am seventeen, and really hope everyone here is open-minded to age being just a number. So please, do not reply telling me I will have it better later on, or my problems are because of my age. I know there is a possibility that things will get better, and believe me, I really do not think this has to do with teenage hormones. I have read about many middle aged women and men with the same problems. I understand that I am a very negative person, most likely due to depression. I am very irritable, only maybe once a week I am happy for most of the day. I also know that I have never really been happy. I have never been optimistic, and have always been sensitive, emotional, and not very confident. At the moment I do not have any friends. I haven't really had any friends for a few years now. Once every few months or so I'll go out, and then just want to leave within a couple of hours. It's very stressful to me. And when I do want to leave, I just tell myself I have a problem, because everyone else I know seems to get along with people just fine. I am also like this with jobs. I go in and out of jobs. One time I even faked a family emergency just to leave work...and I was crying about it. If one thing goes wrong for me, if I smile at someone and they don't smile back, if I feel insecure in any way, my first reaction is to flee. I also, for the most part of my life have always been in a relationship. My boyfriend as of right now and I have been together for over a year. Both of us cheated on each other in the beginning of our relationship, which might be the cause of our jealousy problems now(mostly mine). But, before this relationship, I also had the same problem. I never felt good enough, I believe I will never feel pretty enough. I have big issues with porn, and basically every little thing you can think of. Recently I've been reading about depression and anxiety. I feel the more I understand how and that it is a part of me, the worse I feel about myself. And the more insecure I feel. I feel like I am not fun to be around since I am irritable and sad most of the time. I feel like my boyfriend will find someone who has more of the good qualities. I feel that I will never satisfy or make my parents proud, since I keep leaving jobs. They tell me I'm just lazy. I have quit every single thing in my life that I've tried since I was young. But I really think it's because of my mental state. Going out in public is terrifying, because I don't want to feel bad, ugly, unfun, or not funny. I fear social situations, because I am horrible at making conversation. I've been considering therapy and depression/anxiety pills, but my mom tells me people who take them basically just don't feel anything at all. And I am also afraid to see a doctor and share my feelings. I feel like I have no one to talk to. My dad and I have never had a good relationship, we maybe say two words to each other a day. We have had kind of a bad past, and maybe that's the reason for our lack of communication. My boyfriend doesn't really know how to talk about important or emotional things, unless they have to do with him. I feel like every time I cry I push him farther away from me, and feel I have to hide everything because me being depressed is a turn off to him.  I don't know. I guess we all have to vent somewhere, and to know that there is a place where people feel the same is a great thing to me.  I wish there was an easy way to feel good about myself, and just be happy for once. But I suppose these things take time and a lot of effort. I'm sure I left some things out, but this is all I want to throw at you all for now. Thank you for listening.

" I’m New to this site, I was diagnosed with SLE Lupus about eight months ago and i'm on very strong treatment using predinsone. Everyone around me noticed it first I guess since I was suddenly so quiet, moody and would cry at the drop of a hat. Which, was so unlikely of me I used to crack jokes laugh and my goal was always to have fun and make other's laugh. But since my diagnosis and medications (which I counted and i'm taking like almost 100 pills a week and I just turned 22 yesterday, honestly i'd never thought i'd be in this state at 22 a few years ago)  Anyway I never wanted to admit it, depression is not only a symptom of lupus but it's a side effect of the medication as well, and I think that it's a general first reaction to being told that you have an incurable disease. But I finally am starting to see it now I think that i'm really depressed.  I was never a quiet girl but now i'm so quiet that I think i'm scaring everyone.  but now i'm living with my wonderful boyfriend who seems to understand everything so well and is so patient with me. But I just need a place where I can talk this out with people who understand.

" Kevin got an email from the sportswear place asking his salary range.  Although unscrupulous, I intercepted this email via webmail and replied with a 25k-30k requirement, citing that the last job held paid 28k with benefits.  After sending this email, I let it remain in the inbox to be downloaded to his outlook.  As predicted, he saw the email and wanted to respond to it with a 25-30k requirement.  I am good.  So while he was indisposed in the shitter, I made a dummy email that said the same thing and sent it to a dummy email addy.  It was bounced back undeliverable, but I deleted it from the inbox and deleted mail box so he'll never know the difference.  When he came back in from the bathroom, he read the sent copy and was satisfied with the reply.  Not that he should actually send his own stuff.  I made the resume.  I wrote the cover letter.  I found the job.  I applied him for it.  Then he has the audacity to tell me he has to do everything because I ask him to bring me something from the kitchen while he is up and already in the kitchen.  Hmmmm.  He better get this friggin job because I'll be god damned if I have to sell my car so we can get by and I have to drive a junk piece of shit even though I make a ton of money.  Sad, but true, I have to pay for every bill, plus my debt, rent, car payment, vacation fund (which I made a separate one for me) pet costs, food, EVERYTHING.  He even asked if I could use my credit card to buy him toys.  What?  I don't think so asshole.  If I have to do without some things I like, so do you.

"Martin Luther King Jr. And depression ""As my sufferings mounted I soon realized that there were two ways in which I could respond to my situation -- either to react with bitterness or seek to transform the suffering into a creative force. I decided to follow the latter course""- King JR. Today got me thinking...We need to figure out how we can turn our discontent, anxiety, anhedonia, insecurity, self hatred, and the meaninglessness that we all feel into real world change that we can see, touch , and feel proud of in a tangible form. We need to figure out as a community, how we can re-direct our negative feelings into helping  others, and maby in the process we will be helping ourselves. I think alot of us feel meaningless, and have a hard time creating motivation to get us out of bed, besides our rare and far between moments of clarity. If we could find a way to re-direct our negative energy and encourage eachother to work towards causes we believe in, we could change the world while at the same time changing ourselves.At this point in my life, I have a ""good job"" and financial security, but I still experience horrible depression and that underlying feeling that im a failure and living a ""meaninglessness existence"". I have come to find that the only time I really feel ""alive"", or any feeling remotely resembling happiness is when I am either on drugs, or when I am helping people and making a difference. The latter of those two has actually improved my life, and I am hoping that as a depression community, we can motivate eachother to help re-direct our sadness to further causes that are meaningful to us, and hopefully squash our cynicism.

" Yup, today was just 'one of those days'.  Everyone has them, they are inevitable, along with many other things in life.  I woke up late, and isn't it funny, it seems that most days when u start them off bad by sleeping in when you shouldn't, they just go downhill from there.  It's true, observe your day next time you wake up late...  but it wasn't the small annoyances that made my day 'one of those days'... these small things such as being late for work, the kids being off, tripping over EVERYTHING, breaking my cell phone (on one of the trips ), and losing my keys just made the bigger things in my life... much BIGGER today... As I look on my life right now, it seems like utter chaos, and I don't like it.  I am trying to be strong, but lately I just don't know.  How do you gracefully walk away from someone you love no matter how right you KNOW it is, especially when you are sending them straight into the arms of someone else?? Between this, and many other things going on, I , for the first time in my life, feel completely lost.  And I spend a lot of time trying not to feel sorry for myself, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  I don't know how people can deal with so much WORSE, and it happens. Daily and in tragic ways.  So,this pattern of thinking does put things in perspective b/c my life isn't exactly tragic, but my sentimental side tends to still succeed in getting in the way.  Anyway let's just say that after today, I hope I wake up one time tomorrow, so it's not another ""one of those days"" :) ",0,yup today just one day them inevitable thing life woke late not funny day u start bad sleeping not just downhill there true observe day time wake late not small annoyance day one day small thing late work kid off tripping everything breaking cell phone on trip losing key just bigger thing life bigger today look life right now like utter chaos not like it trying strong lately just not know gracefully walk away love matter right know is especially sending straight arm else this thing going on time life feel completely lost spend lot time trying not feel sorry myself work doe not not know people deal worse happens daily tragic way sothis pattern thinking doe thing perspective bc life not exactly tragic sentimental tends succeed getting way let just say today hope wake time tomorrow not one day

" Yeah, so today I wasted sitting around doing nothing, but wishing that I could do other things. I should stop sitting around not doing anything about it, but I don't know. Maybe this right now is just pms I don't know haha. I wish that whole deal with Brendan never happened. I really liked him alot, and as much as we all say this, he was different. He is different, I swear it. I was so so upset when he said we couldn't be together, but I didn't tell him. maybe I should have. I didn't want to put more on his shoulders though, so maybe i did the right thing?

Justin pissed me off today, well kind of. Originally i was going to take a day off of work on the 12th to go to ozzfest with him. Now he was whinning about a hurt ankle, I told him take some painkillers get a brace and lets go. The he made the excuse of his mom was being dumb about it. He's just a talker i think, but then again I am too. I try not to be, but its just how things go sometimes I guess. I need to work on that.  I feel so sick right now, all because of the stupid period. Rawr guys should have to go through this. Then again I don't have to worry about boners or blue balls or any of that guy stuff. So I guess its all good.  Another 3rd of July that I won't be doing anything for. Darn. Oh well next year should be good, maybe charles, his friend and i will all end up throwing a party. If that actually happens where I'd move in with him. Who knows, I've got plenty of time to plan anyways.  I hate stupid drama. Especially people who just start it cause they want something to talk about and look cool with. so so stupid. Then again I don't know. maybe i do to..I hope not hah.

"I am scared Hey guys, posting this on a throw away just incase.  Anyway, a bit of back story: Me and this guy at work met because of our smoking habits. We both happen to smoke weed, so naturally we started hanging out together. It was all cool for a while, and then he started getting needy, trying to get whatever he could from me. He would ask for cash, ask me to buy him food, ask me for bud etc.  Then I found out by mistake that he is a meth smoker, which is something I do not agree with at all. He just became more hostile around me after this point (not physically, only slightly verbally/emotionally), so I decided to slowly break the tie.  So I started to ignore his messages and Facebook texts. I quit work btw (its been 6 months). He doesn't know where I live, but we both know that our town is very small. Basically everyone knows everyone here. So the chance of me meeting up with him in the future is very possible.  Anyway, as bad as all that sounds, I want to try and mend the relationship. What should I do?  I've added an image for reference: https://imgur.com/8fZq5JO  Edit: I never blocked him, I deleted my account because fuck Facebook.

"Thinking of quiting my job I work as a waitress and it's killing me inside. I have anxiety along with depression and having to answer phones, greet customers, small talk etc is just exhausting for me. I also don't get along with some people there. My boss and the chef mainly. I get really anxious the entire day beforehand (work evenings) and it just puts me in a bad spot.  Another reason for wanting to quit is I'm currently a student and I'm in the last leg of my final year dissertation, I just don't want the stress of having to go deal with my boss and having to take orders etc when I have this important deadline coming up.

"I am new here today. I believe I have been suffering from depression since I was a late teen. I am now 42, run my own business and just started Prozac late December & seeing a psychologist in late Nov. I do not feel any better but it is a relief just knowing that you are doing something other than trying to ignore a definite but unexplainable problem. I suffer from severe anxiety, fall asleep fine but wake up at 2.00 am with my mind racing a million miles a minute, mostly about work. This anxiety and depression has definitely affected my relationship with my wife & kids. Most times when you're at work you want to be home & vice versa, really don't know what you want. I do not feel like talking to anyone & have cut off most of my good friends. I understand most men do not want to admit they have a problem until their wife leaves them and it's too late. I am happy that is not the case with me. I just hope the medication kicks in soon so I can see what it feels like to be normal if that is possible.

"should i be upset with my best friend? My best friend of over 10 years recently took her first trip to New York City. I was so excited for her, and she had asked about what my favorite things to do when I was there were. I knew that she would love the view from the empire state building and decided to buy her a ticket up as a christmas gift. When I gave her the gift, she was really excited but as her trip has come and gone it is apparent that she didn't go despite texting me multiple times on the trip saying how excited she was and mentioning vague plans for when she might go up. I know she arrived with little to no real plans for the entire week and spent a lot of time wandering, which is why I feel that letting the gift go to waste is kind of disrespectful. I also feel that if she were upfront and let me know that she didn't go would be much better than trying to ignore that it happened. I want to know what other people's thoughts on this are before I talk to her, and also maybe how to approach her about it because this is something that is uncharacteristic of her and kind of hurtful to me.

"Does anyone else miss the person they used to be? I've always struggled with depression, but sometimes it's more manageable than other times. I've noticed that with every new year and myself getting older, I begin to look back on my past and long for it, even sometimes breaking down because I miss the person I used to be.  I'm 23, so still young, but I really wish I could go back and be 19/20 again because that was when I was truly happy. I had moved out of my hometown, had lots of friends, a good relationship, I lost tons of weight and was confident for the first time ever, I traveled and worked for fun instead of working as a means of survival. I loved life, I had so much energy and such a bright outlook on everything and I had a lot of fun.  Now, that's all over. I really only have one good friend left from those times and he doesn't even live near me anymore; sometimes I get really down when I think about old friends and start thinking about things I could've said differently that might've prevented the arguments we had that would eventually lead to the end of our friendship, I really never knew how much I needed them until they no longer wanted me in their lives. My relationship fizzled out in the same way and I've yet to develop a connection like that with anyone again. I've also gained all my weight back and can't stand to look at my own reflection.  I don't know how to be happy like I was again. I look at old pictures from times past with old friends, destinations I went too and I want to cry because I just wish I could go back.

"Is this my distorted reality? Okay, I almost always run into this problem with friends, and I'm not sure how to get out of the situation without feeling guilty or ashamed of losing yet another friend.  Situation One There's this friend whom I helped many times and every single time other people bashed me, she would either laughed with other people or further ridicule me.  Things like asking me to fix her phone, helping her find a place to rent, providing her with advice on many issues...  I have since asked her not to further ridicule me, and her response was, ""oh this is not what I do, but I would like to remain friends with you because you are a resourceful person and you see things differently."" I kind of ghosted her after I graduated from university, but I always wondered whether I handled the situation appropriately.  She always tries to avoid me in public space, but when she gets into a car accident, she would call me and ask for help.  I am neither interested nor in love with her.  I actually felt she might be in a hopeless state, that's why she wanted my help.    SCENARIO TWO I have this friend who always makes weird implication towards how stingy I am.  They made assumptions about my contributions to me and my SO and said things like, ""Oh, if given the opportunity, would you kill [so's name] and claim his insurance policy"", ""You know greedy people normally turn out to be the poorest bunch in the population right?"".  The fact is, I have been contributing to the relationship between my SO, my SO is older than me, so in a way, my SO is more financially independent.  At times when SO is helping me out, I always mark the number down so I know how much I owe SO [actually he calculated the amount and sends me invoices].  But I won't disclose such details to my friends.  I am just disappointed as to how people assume things and the last thing I want is to be the victim in every f*ing relationship.

"I didn't expect there are people here so quick to judge and assume I made a post about how hard it is to date and find someone if you have depression. I mentioned how people with depression who have a significant other most likely have an easier time that those who don't. What I didn't imply was that I wanted that just for the sake of ""curing"" my depression.  And that's what another member tried to pin on me. He or she quickly went into offensive and started preaching about how selfish it is to want to be in a relationship if you're depressed, how I should go seek therapy and that I should realize that relationships aren't a magic cure.  I don't want to be in a relationship for it to fix my depression, I'm going to therapy, taking antidepressants for 6 years now and I am fully aware being with someone isn't a cure ( I was with someone while depressed for 2 years ). I wanted to reply to this person to explain they misunderstood me, but I was too upset, so I deleted the post.  Perhaps my wording was not good enough, but still, such a judgemental approach to answering someone's post on a depression subreddit is in my opinion very saddening.

"Are my friends leaving me out on purpose? This has been bugging me for a while, I mean I've gotten to the point where I've made a Reddit account to vent about it. So I'm on of those girls who has two best friends, I'm sure you can already see where this is headed (I'll call them Susie and Amy).   When I started secondary school I didn't have any friends since I had joined out with my school catchment area. Although, I met Susie and she quickly became my best friend. We were in a big group of girls which included Amy. Amy and Susie had become close since they lived near each other and had had lots of sleepovers and days out together and stuff. I had made friends with a girl called Ruby who was Amy's best friend at the time and eventually Amy and Ruby fell out, causing the group to split up and because I was closer to Susie, I went with her.   This left Amy, Susie, and I to form a little ""squad"" and the three of us were extremely close for the next three years. Some things happened with Susie which resulted in Amy and I falling out with her for about 10 months. Nothing big, just usual girly bitching and drama. Amy and I became extremely close during this time but something Amy told me really hurt.   When we were in the process of making up with Susie, Susie had told Amy that she considered Amy to be the closest person to her. That couldn't be right? I went to Susie's house every Friday? I helped her out with her chores whenever I was over, I stayed over almost every weekend, I went on trips with her and her family all the time, we sat next to each other in almost every class, we constantly texted and called and she wouldn't hesitate to tell me every detail of her life and problems and neither would I. Amy had a job and was always working weekends, she was also never the type to text people or even call since she was always with her sister. So why did Susie consider her closer? It really stung but I got over it.   My issue now is that since the three of us have made up I can't help but feel a little excluded. I'll only give one example since everything's of a similar nature.   We've been off school for the past three days because of the snow. I saw that Susie was at Amy's house on the first day, I was a little bummed about not being invited but I brushed it off since it could've just been a spontaneous visit. But Susie is at Amy's Mothers house today, I'm assuming she's staying over, and it's not like I live an hour away. I live a 15 minute walk away, it would only take 5 minutes to get a lift there and the snow isn't bad anymore. So...did I do something to warrant not being invited? Usually Amy would always invite me over, we would have loads of sleepovers...  And y'know to top it all off, my Grandma passed away on Tuesday, Susie had met my grandma and visited her with me a lot and even though I had told her what happened she messaged me later to ask why I seemed sad, only to act shocked and say she 'never realised' that my grandma had died even though I had already told her. Amy knew my grandma had died too but she hasn't said a word to cheer me up. These girls aren't awkward or unsympathetic either, they've taken care of me when someone has passed away before. Are they being like this on purpose?

"My Wifes Car, Money, and My Brother. What do I do? My wife and I got married, but instead of an engagement ring, we decided I would buy her a car instead. I brought the Toyota and moved in. She already owned another Honda. This way we would have 2.  Eventually, she gave her Honda to her brother (who was also in need), and I told her she could give it to him because her dad had initially bought the Honda anyway, not her, so he has every right to own that Honda especially since we had 2 at the time. Keep i mind that it was ultimately my decision, not hers, to let him have the car, because although I'm married to her and her dad bought her the car, I felt like since her dad ""bought"" it, he has the right to it, and since her brother is her dads ""male"" descendant, he has the right to the car. (Sorry we're an asian family) So now we have 1 Toyota (the engagement ring car). With a baby on the way, we decided we would lease another Nissan ourselves, so we could have 2 cars again. Recently my brother was involved the Caribbean island Hurricanes where he goes to Med School, and his whole semester was shifted back to America until either this August or December.  So now he's also in need of a car for about 8-9 months. I told my wife that since we are leasing a Nissan, we can let my brother borrow our current Toyota for the time being.  My wife doesnt want to give up the Toyota to him in fear that she will lose it. I thought this was unjustified because she gave her Honda to her brother, so why can't I let my brother borrow the Toyota too?  Both of us grew up believing in ""helping"" a person in need, and I feel like I went out of my way to let her brother have a car that was rightfully hers, but she didnt let me do the same when it came to my brother. But then again, I feel like she does have a right to the Toyota because it was a replacement for an engagement ring at the time.  After her brother took the Honda, we have been using 1 car for the last year. I figured we could keep using 1 car for another 8-9 months if it means saving my parents some money in buying my brother a different car.  Am I wrong here? Is she technically right? Am I unreasonable because what we do with the car should be my wife's decision, since it was a replacement for her ring?

"Hello I'm 25 from the UK, I have suffered from depression I would say most of my life, but have only been on medicines (20mg of Prozac) for just over 2 years on and off, I've had times off the medicines and relapsed back into depression and the last time I saw my doctor he said It would be better for me to stay on antidepressants long term. The Prozac is working for me at the moment However I find the medicines interrupt my sleep and I wake 3 or 4 times a night and the sleep I do get is very light and ""dreamy"" sleep, plus I seem to be a bit lightheaded and reckless, on my motorbike for example I do stupid things like speeding and other dangerous stuff (to myself not others), which before off the medicines I would never do because I was very paranoid and cautious. I was off Prozac for a while late last year and things went down hill fast, I was cutting my arms and wanted to kill myself, I felt I had no reason to live, I was drinking to relive the depression, and I was drinking about 10 to 12 cans of lager(or 3 bottles of wine) a night, thinking about it I was wrecking my liver and feeling even more depressed in the morning, plus I was putting on loads of weight with all the beers, which was another reason to make me feel like crap. After New Year I made the decision (with my doctor) to go back on the antidepressants, and cut the booze almost out (I still drink about 1 or 2 a night but that's all) because things could not get any worse. I feel a lot better, I am back in the gym and getting back into shape, and my job is going well, I am in a recovery stage at the moment, I just hope I don't f--k it up again like before. Anyway I hope everybody on here is ok. Warm Regards to you all",1,hello uk suffered depression say life medicine mg prozac just year off time medicine relapsed depression time saw doctor said better stay antidepressant long term prozac working moment medicine interrupt sleep wake time night sleep light dreamy sleep plus bit lightheaded reckless motorbike example stupid thing like speeding dangerous stuff to not others medicine paranoid cautious prozac late year thing went hill fast cutting arm wanted kill myself felt reason live drinking relive depression drinking can lageror bottle wine night thinking wrecking liver feeling depressed morning plus putting load weight beer reason make feel like crap new year decision with doctor antidepressant cut booze i drink night all thing not worse feel lot better gym getting shape job going well recovery stage moment just hope not fk like before hope everybody ok warm regard
"Hi all, I've just registered here... I've been depressed for quite a while, my dad died when I was 7 and my best friend died when we were 18. After the death of my father I was in counseling, but my counselor stopped coming to school to see me and I don't think I ever got anywhere from it. I'm currently 23, almost 24 (and male, from the UK for those keeping count) I've felt crap for ages... I hate my job, and doing that along with the stress of my final year of university sent me on a downward spiral. I would worry so much about my workload, but have no motivation to do it and get out of the situation. I hate being single, but can't find someone special who likes me, who I like back. I want to leave my job, but I can't afford to until I leave university and get a job doing something I want to. I had thought about suicide, but I know the pain of losing people close to me, and I couldn't inflict that pain on someone else. I considered cutting myself too. I thought that maybe if I was hurt, I could get extra time for university work, and maybe someone would help me. But I realized that I shouldn't do that, and should see someone about it. I also didn't have the balls to do it. I think bad thoughts a lot but I don't think I could go through with them. I was worried about going to the doctor though. My previous experience with a counselor has put me off them, and I don't like talking to strangers about my problems - that said I don't like telling people I know either because I feel that they will judge me. I was also concerned about medication because I don't know if I like the idea of chemicals altering my brain (apart from alcohol that is!) But about 3 weeks ago I finally went to see my doctor. He has put me on 20mg of Fluoxetine a day, although I'm not sure whether it is doing much. I've been having headaches and going a bit dizzy as well as getting sleepy (among other side effects). It's weird though, I don't know whether I'm feeling better or not, my friends say I seem different and better for taking it but I still feel bad at times... I still lie in bed at night worrying. But I think maybe I need to take it more and see how it effects me long term. I guess even on medication we all have good days and bad days. I was scared to tell my mother that I was on anti-depressants, as she works in mental health. Some would see this as a blessing as she understands the field to a great degree, but I was worried because I thought that she might think I was mad. I eventually got the courage to tell her after about 5 days though because I was very dizzy and I thought that she would suspect me of being on illegal drugs. She is being very supportive now, while still keeping enough distance that I don't feel like she's worrying too much about me. It's good to know that she understands that it's going to help me cope though... and she says its only a minor drug compared to what some of her patients take to stop the voices telling them to do things. Anyway I decided to look for somewhere online where other people know what it feels like, and I am glad that I've found this place. I hope I can make some new friends here, and maybe I can help a couple of people too.",1,hi all just registered here depressed quite while dad died best friend died death father counseling counselor stopped coming school not think got it currently and male uk keeping count felt crap age hate job doing stress final year university sent downward spiral worry workload motivation situation hate single special like me like back want leave job afford leave university job doing want to thought suicide know pain losing people close me not inflict pain else considered cutting too thought maybe hurt extra time university work maybe help me realized not that it did not ball it think bad thought lot not think them worried going doctor though previous experience counselor them not like talking stranger problem said not like telling people know feel judge me concerned medication not know like idea chemical altering brain apart alcohol is week ago finally went doctor mg fluoxetine day not sure doing much having headache going bit dizzy getting sleepy among effect weird though not know feeling better not friend say different better taking feel bad time lie bed night worrying think maybe need effect long term guess medication good day bad day scared tell mother antidepressant work mental health blessing understands field great degree worried thought think mad eventually got courage tell day dizzy thought suspect illegal drug supportive now keeping distance not feel like worrying me good know understands going help cope though say minor drug compared patient stop voice telling thing decided look online people know feel like glad place hope make new friend here maybe help couple people too
"Scared of my mother, because of fear of jocasta complex Ok, this all started pretty normally, mum was worried about me being suicidal and hugging me.

"Just tied a noose I just looked up some videos and learned to tie a noose. Suicide is all I can think of right now and I'm scared to do it only because the thought of becoming a vegetable and having to live like that terrifies me. I guess this is one more step I'm trying out to kind of ease myself into the whole thing.  People told me 10 years ago to stick with it because it'll get better. They still tell me that even though I would love to go back 10 years now because of how much worse its gotten and how much better even that was compared to now. I didn't think it would get this bad but it did.  I've been through so many medications, doctors, checked myself into a hospital 3 times when I was sure I was going to do kill myself, called the suicide hotline several times, talked with friends, made lifestyle changes and all that. It still didn't work. I've only gotten more depressed.  There's no helping me. I am just supposed to feel miserable. I'll never be happy. I'm not sure at this point if I even want to be happy anyways.  Hoping I can work up the courage to kill myself by the end of today.

"Hello again everyone, my real name is Mike. I found this site a couple weeks ago but have been pretty busy with the holidays and a new job. So I thought I would post a bit more about myself. This isn't easy since I am not that good at talking about myself but here goes. I am 35 years old and have been depressed as long as I can remember. When I was 12 or 13 years old I remember sitting in my closet in my room with the doors shut writing a suicide note. After talking to a friend of mine about 7 years ago who started going to a therapist and taking Prozac, I decided to go get help. I didn't even know to call it depression until I started talking to him. I was diagnosed with Dysthymic Disorder and have been on and off a couple different kinds of medicines, one of which was Effexor and the other one I can't remember the name but it started with and S. I have a bad habit of remembering every bad thing that has ever happened to me and continually go over and over it in my head. I will bring up something with my brother or sister and they say ""I can't believe you remember that"" and yet sometimes I am lucky I remember my own name. I just started a new job recently and will not have insurance until the end of January. I am seriously considering going back to a therapist and possibly getting on medicines again. I am tired of carrying around this baggage and want to do something about it. There are so many things I want to do with my life and seem held back by my depression. I found this site one night after feeling really depressed over something that I can't even remember now in the hope talking to people who knew how I felt and what I was going through.",1,hello everyone real mike site couple week ago pretty busy holiday new job thought post bit myself not easy not good talking go year old depressed long remember year old remember sitting closet room door shut writing suicide note talking friend year ago started going therapist taking prozac decided help did not know depression started talking him diagnosed dysthymic disorder couple different kind medicine effexor remember started s bad habit remembering bad thing happened continually head bring brother sister say i believe remember that lucky remember name just started new job recently not insurance end january seriously considering going therapist possibly getting medicine again tired carrying baggage want it thing want life held depression site night feeling really depressed remember hope talking people knew felt going through

Is it obvious when you have depression? I wonder if I have some form of mild depression or I just have low self esteem. I became a mute quite a few years ago after acouple of events that got me down. I think it may have been catatonia. But I'm not 100%. Ever since then I don't feel like I got back to my normal self. I'm a lot shyer and I don't have much luck socially or romantically or in my career. The best way to put it would be I lost my personality. I can really beat myself up sometimes because I hate myself. When something bad happens I really start self loathing quite badly. I don't feel suicidal. I hate myself more than I hate my life. I blame my lack of success on myself. I don't enjoy things as much as I used to so I have no real hobbies. I don't think I'm likable and I can't even pass interviews these days. I lost my personality and that's why I hate myself. I'm unrecognisable to who I used to be so I isolate myself a lot more these days. I don't think significantly depressed but I wonder if mild depression is the cause of my loss of personality? Or could it be something else that caused me to change? All I know is I've lost a lot of confidence and I'm always beating myself up about it,1,obvious depression wonder form mild depression just low self esteem mute quite year ago acouple event got down think catatonia not not feel like got normal self lot shyer not luck socially romantically career best way lost personality really beat hate myself bad happens really start self loathing quite badly not feel suicidal hate hate life blame lack success myself not enjoy thing used real hobby not think likable pas interview day lost personality hate myself unrecognisable used isolate lot day not think significantly depressed wonder mild depression cause loss personality caused change know lost lot confidence beating
"I know I am depressed but I have no energy to do anything to counter it. I've been searching for a job for 4 months to no avail (I used to have an office job for 4 years before quitting it to take a leap of faith to migrate to another country), and from the second month onward, I've plunged deeper and deeper into depression.   Back then in uni days, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and was put on medications. I've been off them since my graduation, because I didn't want to depend on them for the rest of my life and I didn't really have the funds to continue the treatment back then.   These days I feel exactly like I am slogging through those low energy periods again. My mind would never shut down at my usual bedtime and at times anxiety would keep me awake until 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning. My biological clock is a total mess, in the morning I would just sleep in and refuse to wake up, even though it's already past noon. I tend to shy away from as much social interaction as possible; I just plainly don't want to meet anyone, it freaks me out and makes me uncomfortable. I even refuse to answer any emails or continue the dreary job searching and job application.  I know that I am in a big mess. I disgust myself for my lack of energy and determination to do anything. But then when I'm faced with the colossal task at hand, I'd chicken out, then I'd sleep on it, hoping that everything would somehow sort themselves out, only to find myself wake up in the next morning groggy and lethargic.

"Classmate/ bullying problems I have a classmate who constantly bullies our other classmates. Seems like she feels as if she is superior, the leader of our whole class and everyone has to follow and do what she says. If someone is late to the meetings she is harassing them. She is being very rude and insulting. Her voice is always extremely loud, and if she has a problem with people she always shouts it to the class instead of approaching the person and discussing it with them like a normal person would do.  For example, she was upset with a group of her classmates because they didnt want to follow whatever she says, and she heard that they might have said something bad about her, but instead of approaching them to ask them about it, if its true or whatsoever, everytime we have meetings she will just talk extra loud and will let our whole class listen to her nonsense comments like she keeps on talking about ""fake people"", as if she wanted the group who said something about her to hear it and feel guilty.  I dont get why she does it and why she is the way she is. Does anyone have an idea? And what should we do about it? It's getting annoying and I know already if we would approach and talk to her she would put the blame on everyone else and just be more mad and find stupid excuses. Does anyone have any advice? By the way, including teachers or some other people doesnt help either so any other advices or info to shed light on this is welcome.

" Hey ... my name's JJ and this is my online diary.  A couple years back, I used to publish this journal on urbanboys.com, which no longer exists.  Basically, I chronicled my ""sexcapades"" and those of my friends.  It was a lot of fun, and it helped me to meet a LOT of great guys ... guys that I will be friends with for life.  But, it was VERY time consuming.  I'm thinking using Blogger will make it much easier, and I've decided to give it another try.  I'll also use this journal to keep you updated on what's going on with my other sites (like  urlLink http://urbanboys.blogspot.com  and  urlLink http://urbanboyoftheweek.blogspot.com ) and how things are going in general with me.  So, not just sex sex sex this time :-)  But, I'm sure there'll be plenty of that, cuz I'm still addicted!

"I'm new to this forum and actually to the whole talking to people I don't know online thing.  I've been looking around a lot online to find somewhere I can talk, but all the chat rooms and forums say they're about one thing and then you get inside and everything's about sex.  Then I stumbled into this place.  I started reading postings and everyone seems so concerned about everyone even though they have never met these people.  I haven't struggled with depression my whole life or anything like that.  I am only 22 but feel so old.  I am very, very recently separated (let's face it broken up) with my ex-fiance.  We have dated for almost five years and have a son together who will be two on Saturday.  He hasn't treated me the best (never hit or anything physical like that just never around) and he's really not what I want my husband or even the father of my children to act like.  He does have moments of goodness and this is what makes it so hard because why can't he always act like that.  I know he's capable of it.  I told him we should separate but I know he's been thinking it for a long time.  He's been forcing things because of his family and because he feels ""respect"" and blah blah for me.  I stayed around because he's the father of my child and face it it's hard to find someone new when you're a woman and you already have a kid.  I love him very much and I guess I was just expecting him to wake up one day and say man I need to change or I'm going to lose this great girl.  I wanted to separate because I think that's the only way he's going to realize how good of a girl I am and how good I am for him.  Now I'm scared though that he'll never come to this realization or meet someone else.  He says he's not looking, but let's face it he's a man.  He says he needs at least 6 months to find himself.  It makes it hard on me because we have a son together and for this reason my ex is always coming around and actually now that we're not together we probably see him more.   I have no family where I live and the last 5 years have been devoted to my ex and son.  I have managed to lose contact with any friends I had and never made any new ones.  I am now completely alone except for my son, which I feel like I can't take good care of because I'm always crying.  I'm a high school teacher and I had to take a couple days off this week because I'm so touchy and can cry if the wrong thought pops up in my head.    It's affecting every part of my life and it's so overwhelming.  I used to be afraid that if we ever split I would end up alone with only one son and no family; now I'm afraid that he'll never come back!  I really just need someone to talk to.

"My latest depression has a cure, and it's my girlfriend. So this is my story about a severe depression and anxiety I have been experiencing these months.  TLDR, we kinda broke up back in April, we had some issues regarding me being a prick. But, she forgave me as we have a perfect relationship (that's right, I do think it's marvelous). But for some important reason that I don't wanna give details in, we can't be together anymore. So, I started having anxiety attacks, and all my world was like hell, it was so bad, I felt like I had to do something about it. Anyways, I am fighting to be back again with her, and she also is waiting for me. We all dream about things or situations where we would allegedly be happy with: money, being successful.. all that kind of stuff.  Here's what I have learned: When I dream about all this stuff, at the end the only thing, I mean, my only desire, the only thing that I crave in this world, and which I would be crushed to not have, is her. I'm a person who deeply depends on others, I previously gave myself into deep friendships, but after all, and after all experience, my only friendship and relationship I'm keeping with is my girlfriend. She literally is my everything regarding my happiness, and me being alive.   Here's the summary: I wanna go back with my girlfriend, and I am depressed and sad if I'm not with her. I know we'll be hopefully soon together, but as the meantime, I feel like my days are worthless and my life is meaningless.

"Well I'm 13 so please excuse my grammar and spelling. Well it started almost about... 1.3 yr ago. I started to get large mood swings and would end up being sad or feeling guilty nearly everyday. That's when i discovered cutting myself. It started off as what does it feel like then grew into and addiction. I used to be doing it nearly everyday. IT made/makes me feel like there's nothing wrong. Well this grew bigger and bigger and i didn't tell anyone about it. After about 8 months i started to lie to myself and say everything was fine, It worked. Only temporarily. Around 3 months ago the feelings came back and i still have them at this moment. I have researched a lot about clinical depression. I still cut and i hate it. I came right out to my parents and said ''Maybe i enjoy cutting myself"" when we were in a huge fight. My dad turned around and said ""we don't care if you cut yourself"". This definitely didn't help. So right now i have one person i can talk to about it and has a good friend of mine. I checked the symptoms of clinical depression on Answers.com and i have 12/13 of them. I need to go see a doctor i know but i just can't. There's something stopping me and i don't know what it is. I just want to solve it on my own but i can't. I need Help. I have also been thinking about committing suicide and doing drugs but my friends that know i cut are stopping me. I know i will be missed. I just can't live on anymore... I can't see myself living past 18. Can anyone relate to this?

" Last night was not our typical Thursday night!  We started the night out with happy hour at Baby A's on Barton Springs Rd. Our friend had her 22nd birthday so we all hung out drinking their signature purple ""way too much everclear in them but we like them"" margaritas.  There is a known rule amungst my friends and I wish to share this with anyone who reads this...if you ever go to Baby A's for happy hour and you have 2 purples, go home or stop drinking!!!! We did neither.    You see, we had an urge...Lava Lounge is one of our favorite bars downtown for two reasons, 1) it's located on 7th street around the corner from Fuel so it's nice to get away from the 6th street crowd! (For those of you that are not familiar with Austin, TX, sixth street is a popular strip that has about 60 bars adjacent to each other.) The music at Lava Lounge is formatted to fit everyones liking.  If you don't like the song on now, the next one will make you happy. 2) Lava Lounge is the home for our Bartender of the Month 3 months in a row! (Bartnder of the Month is voted on by our users)Walk up to the bar and ask for Gary, tell him you want the Marcus and Jack shot! Red Bull/Jager shots will come your way! Enjoy...oh yeah...tell him that ATXNIGHTLIFE.COM sent you!  We did make our way down to the Dizzy Rooster where it just so happend that Dax from MTV's Punk'd was at the bar.  We talked to him for a bit, and he said that he was in town filming a movie with Greg Kinnear (I think that's how you spell his last name).  It's funny how when you see someone on TV you have a certain idea of that person, but once you meet them, they aren't exactly what you imagined.  I pictured Dax as the party guy that goes out and drinks the night away.   Party Guy: yes Drinker: no But we had fun anyway! He was a pretty cool kat and the ladies sure loved him.    When we finished our sixth street bar hop, we ended it right where we started...Lava Lounge.  *From here on out, this is here-say: we walked into the bar and the place was packed!  We walked up to the bar 5 minutes past ""1st last call"" and Gary started making us shots.  The night couldn't have been better, good times with good friends, and one hell of a cheap tab!  Oh...I forgot to mention one thing...I met a midget who was an ex-pornstar! (or so he claimed...didn't matter cause he was surrounded by a crowd of girls, so we talked to him.)

"Roomie read a text I sent about her on another friends phone So I'm gonna delete this right after but I kinda fucked up bad... I'm a 24 yo female btw living in an apartment w 4 other ppl. Ok so I came home from a stressful night and one of my roommates was drunk af, I left to go see a friend for a bit and when I returned there was a pot of mac and cheese sitting on the stove with the burner on high and no one was around... turns out drunk roomie started cooking then abandoned it there. What annoyed me more was that it was my mac and cheese she cooked and burnt. I understand we get drunk and we take our roomies food... it happens ok, I've done it (rarely) but yeah it happens. I was mainly annoyed that the stove was on high and left unattended while she went out partying! If I wouldn't have come home it could have started a fire. SO me being the idiot I am, I sent a text to our other roomie just explaining that I was a bit annoyed that our other roomie left the stove on and was also using my food wo asking. It wasn't shit talking in my opinion, as the text legit said.. ""I just came home and _____ left the stove on and burnt food and left it there and it was also my food so I'm a bit annoyed"" Me and said roomie had been talking earlier about how we were a bit annoyed she came home so drunk and loud. I legit just said I was a bit annoyed bc she left the stove on and used my food. But I wasn't like incredibly mad I was just venting bc I know I'd get over it in an hour and just tell her tomorrow not to leave food unattended or ask if she'd like to take some of my food.... SO here's where im dumb.... my other roomie left her phone in the kitchen and the message must have popped up or the other girl was snooping through her phone and saw it.... she then proceeded to text me bitching me out and sending awful passive aggressive texts. I remained calm and mature and just explained that yes I was a bit annoyed, but I didn't send the text to be malicious or shit talk, and that I wasn't mad at her. She turned it all around on me and now I'm left feeling like the mean person. The only person I normally vent to about friends is my sister and no one else.. I don't like ""shit talking"" but everyone gets annoyed and needs to vent from time to time. It's healthy to get it off your chest and I didn't mean for her to see it... also it wasn't a mean text or anything....and also she was the one to disrespect me so I feel I had a right to be annoyed, though I shouldn't have sent that text but it could be a lot worse ... WHAT DO I DO NOW. She's so mad and ignoring me. Ugh.

"My little brother was in pain and I didn't help him I need to get something off my chest that I haven't talked to anyone about before. It's about a situation, where my mother freaked out over my little brother's bratty behaviour. He was about 5 years old and throwing a fit, he was in a really bad moment, he kicked my leg, and all those things weren't pretty. Something must have been bothering him, usually he is a very wonderful person, funny and smart, but just threw a tantrum like every kid does once in a while. When he called me a bitch (his big sister, and I might even have been teasing him) my mother totally freaked out, she scolded him loudly and he already started crying. She went outside to the car and took out his car seat and said she wouldn't need it anymore now that he's not part of the family anymore but will be taken away by child services.  He stood on the front porch and cried his heart out and screamed to my mother ""I don't want to go to the welfare home"" (that's what it was called to him apparently) and he sobbed so desperately and feared for his life and safety. And my mom then looked at him sternly and asked him to apologize and then they hugged and made up.  It is probably the most painful thing in my life. I know he might already have forgotten it and he gets along quite well with my mother (he's a teenager now), but I do think back to that moment and feel that stabbing pain in my chest, as I was standing there passively and watching my mother use him emotionally. He was so fragile and vulnerable, and if I could, I would just wrap him in my arms and love and comfort him, until there's no sadness left in him.",0,little brother pain did not help need chest not talked before situation mother freaked little brother bratty behaviour year old throwing fit really bad moment kicked leg thing not pretty bothering him usually wonderful person funny smart just threw tantrum like kid doe while called bitch his big sister teasing him mother totally freaked out scolded loudly started cry went outside car took car seat said not need anymore not family anymore taken away child service stood porch cried heart screamed mother i not want welfare home that called apparently sobbed desperately feared life safety mom looked sternly asked apologize hugged up probably painful thing life know forgotten get quite mother he teenager now think moment feel stabbing pain chest standing passively watching mother use emotionally fragile vulnerable could just wrap arm love comfort him sadness left him
"Why did they forget me? I was never someone people would consider anti-social. Rather, I was the opposite. I loved talking to people, meeting new people, and just being social. In highschool, I never had a ""group"" of friends per se, but I knew almost everyone in my grade, and was friends with a lot of them. After high school, I went to a local university, so I'd have to commute to my school, unlike the rest of my classmates who went to to schools further away. My current university is a huge commuter school, so there's no on campus experience to be had, and I'm actually transferring to a local community college instead, so I can transfer out later. Through all this, the friends I had in high school have all kind of forgotten about me. Even in high school, I'd be the first to message people, or the one to initiate hangouts and whatnots. But now, in college, its the same but so much more lonely. All my friends are away, and I'm rotting here. I feel so alone. On top of this, I miss my ex from a year ago. We went from meeting, to best friends, to huge fallout, to reconciliation, to best friends, to dating, to nothing. I miss the friend part. This loss has dampened my mood for a year now. Just overall, I feel so lonely. A year ago I felt on top of the world, and now, I'm back to shit. All I ever wanted was someone to message me first saying ""Hey dude, how are ya?"" Its been a while"". The worst was Thanksgiving break, where I had excitedly messaged a few people saying I'm so happy to see them and we (read: I asked to) made plans to hangout. A lot of them fell through. Others postponed till Christmas break. I messaged 28 people one day, desperate to talk to someone. I feel like I will never be anyone's ""everything"" ya know? I want a dog. Not just because its cute and all, but I want a companion that will never forget me, and will love me. I hate myself. Depression sucks. Loneliness sucks.

"Describe your depression Here is how I would describe mine: I live an exceptionally fortunate life. I am a college student interning for a commercial real estate development company. I had two internships last summer, one in venture capitalism and one teaching middle schoolers how to code. I have a potential internship lined up for a Fortune 500 company in Miami next summer and potentially an private equity internship lined up. I have all the networks and connections in the world to be successful. But I feel so unhappy and miserable with my life. My thoughts are so irrational and negative that I can't see how fortunate I am to have all that I have. I make great money with my summer internship, more money then most adults make, but none of that matters, because I still have suicdial thoughts almost everyday. I feel hopeless all day, everyday.

"I went on 6weeks. FMLA almost two years ago for depression, GAD and Panic Disorder. I felt uncomfortable when I went back, after having had the same position for 25 yrs, but I'm still there, and no one made a big deal about it when I came back. I'm still on medicines for depression and have a ton of anxiety, which the medicines help with. I'm able to function in a fast paced environment where things change every day. I can sleep, which is great as I put off going in for treatment and was beat when I finally got on medicines, had lost weight, and was headed for agoraphobia. Medicines and some therapy work well for me. I can't deny that I had myself under one ton of stress and had no outlets. I found out the hard way that there's more to life than work, work, work. One has to find a way to relax, too.",1,went week fmla year ago depression gad panic disorder felt uncomfortable went back having position yr there big deal came back medicine depression ton anxiety medicine help with able function fast paced environment thing change day sleep great going treatment beat finally got medicine lost weight headed agoraphobia medicine therapy work me deny ton stress outlet hard way life work work work way relax too
"I need to get my life on track Im 23 year old black man who just graduated from one of the best universities in the US. I've been depressed as fuck for a large portion of the last 4-6 years. I have no money, no girlfriend(or prospects), and no social life to speak of. I had a solid social life in college but had no luck with girls. Made a lot of friends but none that I'd consider great ones. I'm  afraid of public expression, if I come out of this shell I'll just be that little underdeveloped, short loser who thinks he's the shit when he's accomplished nothing in life. I'm afraid of what other people think of me, do they think I'm smart? Do they think I'm nerdy? Do they think I can't dance? Do they think I'm too short? Do they think I'm attractive? Do they think I'm gay? Do they think my voice is deep enough? Do they think I'm laid back? Do they think I'm fake? Do they think I'm a pussy? Do they think I get girls? Do they think my dick is small? Do they think I'm dressed well? Do they think I'm shy? Do they think I'm lame for a black guy? Do they think I act too white? Do they notice the awkwardness when I talk? Do they think I speak well? Do they think I ask too many questions? This causes me to lie to the people around me, including my family about little things that it's unnecessary to lie about. To put on this front of fake confidence when inside I feel like I'm not worth shit. I blow off my friends and then justify it to myself that I'm somehow too good for them. I don't pick up phone calls from family members and try to keep to myself. I just do nothing all day and wait for shit to come to me. I'm not the guy that gets girls, when it comes to trying to actually start a relationship with a girl my awkwardness and lameness just begins to show itself and she immediately senses it and can tell I'm not shit. I've had sex with 2 girls in my life and couldn't actually bust a nut for whatever reason. I'm an asshole to the people around me that do really nice things for me but somehow my brain keeps justifying my behavior and I keep doing it. I can't bring myself to do anything that is remotely productive or will help me better my life. I'm self aware to the point where I know I'm being a complete piece of shit but I can't find the motivation to turn it around. It's like my brain telling me I'll be content just living in my parents house until I'm fucking 60 years old. Somehow when I look in the mirror I see myself as an attractive man, I just look super young for 23, people say I look as young as 16 so I'm also self conscious about that which also makes me put on this facade when I'm around people. Recently for long stretches of months I just go completely ghost and don't leave the house or do anything of use. On the bright side I've had many positive experiences in life where I've felt my potential as a person start to become realized. I have a degree in communication studies from a top 15 university in the US. I have a family that loves and supports me (but probably wants me to move out just as much as I want to move out). This is all pretty incoherent and stream of consciousness but my brain is just really jumbled right now and I had to vent.

"I should be an actor... I feel like most people who have depression could work in theatre or movies. I don't know how you guys feel about putting on an act when really you feel so sad that it's hard to breathe, but recently I have been having to act like I am getting better from depression. My roommate confided in me one day when I came back to our dorms that he struggles with depression. He was placed in a foster home after his parents died, and his foster mom committed suicide. After that, his friend also committed suicide, so of course this takes a toll on someones' emotional health. I told him that I started taking meds and going to therapy, and I smile and laugh and act like I am doing better so that he can feel encouraged to get help with his depression. I feel so fake though, even though I am getting help, I don't think it is helping me, my chest has that particular empty feeling and breathing is hard to do. I feel like crying a lot of the times now while I am laying down in bed, and driving to and from class. I would never let my roommate know that I was actually not doing better though. I really want him to get help because I see myself in him, and he is a really good person who doesn't deserve to be sad.

"Feeling good about helping people Does anyone else here ever feel better about themselves when you're able to offer a little help or guidance to someone off the street you don't know?  As an example, sometime last month I was having a pretty meh day, just... Not feeling the worst ever, but not feeling very good either, when on my way home I happened to find an iPhone sitting on a grate outside the subway station.  I picked it up and looked around for the owner, then after entering the station found a couple of young women searching their bags and I asked if the phone was theirs. It was, and they said ""thank you so much!"" And I felt really happy that I'd been able to help them, like, I just kinda decided right then to forget about my problems, because, I'd helped someone. Like, maybe those two would have never found their phone if I hadn't come along. I mean they probably would have, but, y'know. I felt like I'd been helpful in a real small but meaningful way and that felt good.  I really like helping people, but I usually get upset when I try to help people I actually know personally, because, well, people don't always want help with more personal issues, or even with simple issues from people they know well, and trying to tell when to help or not is just really complicated. Like, I'll just real nicely try to suggest a solution to a problem, or simply offering some consolation, and instead of, I dunno, actually trying it or telling me patiently why that isn't a good idea, they just rail on me and tell me to shut up or whatever. And I just feel like, jeez, what'd I do? I'm trying to help here...  And I always get real upset about that and doubt myself over it, like, am I doing a bad thing by trying to be nice? I know that's not true, I get sometimes people want to figure things out on their own, or I guess you don't like my attitude or blablabla, but, I dunno, you can't maybe acknowledge that I'm trying to do good?  But in a situation where it's just strangers, trying to find their way, cross the street, lost a thing or whatever, it's easy to tell when they need help, because everything's a lot more straightforward, if that makes sense. If someone needs help, it's usually pretty obvious and they're almost always pretty receptive to help, and, provided you just look like a normal person, they don't judge. No biases or baggage over past interactions or whatever, they're just happy to have help.  So yeah I guess this is a little longer than it needs to be, but, yeah. Helping random people feels good and distracts from my depression a little. Is what I was saying.

"During my high school years I was always a little ""klooster"" never went out that much never did anything bad ..... When I left school I moved to Johannesburg and from there moved to my mom in Mpumalanga, South Africa, a day before my 21st birthday I got raped ..... the most terrible feeling ever, I was not wearing any revealing clothes, had jeans a t-shirt and tekkies on, how do you explain this. I always believed that those girls, wearing the most revealing clothes are the ones that ask for it, but do they really?  I can not see how any one can ask for this, it is the worst thing that can ever happen to you.  A few months thereafter I had to have an abortion due to the fact that I could not keep the baby ...... I was way too young, I never and still up until date, don't believe in this type thing, but now I think?  Was it the right thing to do, will you ever be able to face the child the same way you will face a child born into a happy and wonderful marriage? I also suffer from depression, high blood pressure and all those wonderful things, I got married in December 2005 and due to me and my fiance having a big argument with my dad, he never walked me down the aisle on my big day and me and my husband had to pay for the whole wedding, I feel awful, but the things my dad said and done can never be forgiven.  My stepsister had a baby at the end of December and she is getting married now in April 2006, guess who is doing and paying for her wedding .....

I battle to have healthy sex, due to the fact that every time I close my eyes, I see this person on top of me, forcing himself in, I feel guilty to have kids, how can I have more, if I killed one? How can I bring up a family if my own family is up to shit ....  I often find myself wondering why?

"Just wondering, for those who have had lifelong depression did you ever find some joy that wasn’t turned to a sad story? I’m starting to feel that depression never goes away, you just learn to manage it. I however, can’t recall a time in my life where I was happy. I don’t even congratulate myself when I do accomplish something. I don’t allow others to either, because it doesn’t mean much to get praised for things I should’ve accomplished a long time ago. Anyways, I’m on meds and truth is, I don’t feel like myself? I don’t think any drug can make me feel myself? Depression in some wicked way has made me become the person I am today.

"Rolling down hill Hi all,  It all started last year when I quit my bachelor in Physical Therapy. That study didnt seem right for me and I dropped out in feb 2016. From februari till september I've worked a depressing job in an order picking centre to pay for my next year of college. But after that there wasnt any motivation for anything left over in me.   This year I started a new study, lifesciences. It started all fun for the first two months. Because we had the basics of chemistry, anatomy, algebra and physics. But in the beginning of november the second semester started and thus I had tests from the first semester. Failed them all. In the weeks leading to the tests I couldnt concentrate or motivate myself to do anything. I was just at my room doing absolutely nothing. 14 november was my birthday, turned 19. Everyone forgot it except my gf (for 2,5 years). Was a fun day and made me forget the test results and gave me a little hope. Today she told me she was seeing someone else for the last 3 months because I had too little time to see her, because I was always busy with school.   Im feeling that everything is worse. My job sucks but I have to keep it as I got to keep up with school costs. Already got pretty hefty debt from those two halve years of university. I just feel that everything that I do fails. Like the last 2 years I've accomplished nothing. I would like to travel if I'm going to have my second gap year but my funds wouldnt allow it. Working would be my only option but the only jobs that are available will push me over the edge.  But there is something good at the horizon; there is a small chance I'm getting accepted in to the police academy, but that's only a small chance so no big hopes as that makes it worse.",1,rolling hill hi all started year quit bachelor physical therapy study didnt right dropped feb februari till september worked depressing job order picking centre pay year college wasnt motivation left me year started new study lifesciences started fun month basic chemistry anatomy algebra physic beginning november second semester started test semester failed all week leading test concentrate motivate anything just room doing absolutely nothing november birthday turned forgot gf for year fun day forget test result gave little hope today told seeing month little time her busy school im feeling worse job suck got school cost got pretty hefty debt halve year university just feel fails like year accomplished nothing like travel going second gap year fund wouldnt allow it working option job available push edge good horizon small chance getting accepted police academy small chance big hope make worse

Right so he says to me, I shagged a girl before you and am like dude thats not a surprise yknow you told me you had women before me. That shit fair enough cause hes older and yknow its normal for partners to experiment before settling for one. And he goes well I like you, a lot, and I dont want this girl to ruin shit and am like, well I dont see how you arent still shagging her are you? he isnt still shagging her right, so yknow good boy, however, he shagged her before me, like six months before me and yknow what can happen in six months? A goddamn baby can grow in the mofo womb during that time. Hes pissed, he was like I told her it was a shag, she agreed, told me she was on the pill and it mustve glitched that month (as the story always goes) and she got preggaz. I told her to terminate (dude this is a condensed version of the story, there was emotion and shit behind it, so dont go all prolife on me, it's just a minor detail im trying get out there and passed so I can tell the rest of the story). Right, so she starts kicking off saying hes emotionally black mailing her into an abortion and talking about a baby she lost as a teen and shit and am like, okay so just back off. He did, and she came back a few months later like lol theres another guy, not sure if hes the dad or not, I think its you tho. Like, good, thanks bitch, a think its you is all the proof I need. So she sends him laods of scans and basically pretends hes her baby daddy. Annoyed me a bit cos yknow i was a teen wanting to mess round and just yknow settle with this guy and this chick is trying to like worm her way in. She makes friends with his sister on fb (weird cos he doesnt have contact with any of his family, hasnt for like four years prior that) and starts getting pally with his mum dad brothers, all of them. Tells them I was his mistress and they were a couple, they decided to have a baby, and when she got pregnant he started messing round with me, a teenage girl. Fews holes in that story but well skip ahead, and the baby is born. They get this dodgy dna that says its not admissable in court due to infrequencies or something and that close relatives (she was shagging his brother at the time too) could skewer results. Basically the baby daddy could be his bro but itll come back his cause its a shit dna. Anyway it came back the baby was his and he suddenly goes all fatherly. Doesnt see the kid for like six months then starts visits and pays maintance. Meanwhile, shes fucking round going to his family and bitching about how horrible I am being a homewrecker and all that eventho they were a shag and got with him six months after her. He wont get another dna cause he was like paid for one not doing another, and I explained the issues but he wont. ALl our children look identical, the kid has blond hair and blue eyes, me and my partner are both dark and so are our kids, (the girl in question also is dark so where the fuck blond blue eyes came from is beyond me). For months after she kept ringing me saying omg you need to put him on the phone the babys sick and he needs to visit, and if you ignore it shed up it and be like an ambulance is coming now omg its serious (it never was). The kid was in hospital like twenty times in his first week of life, each time let out with nothing serious wrong, altho she exaggurated and made out he was on the brink of death. Tries to get him to take her kids out while Im in mofo labour, giving birth and shes kicking off on the phone saying hes not spending enough time with them. Once I gave birth comes round screaming and shouting how hes off the birth certificate, how shes changing the kids name and how shes taking him to court for more money yhadda yhadda yhadda.

" Where to begin?! The beginning would be good but I feel that jumping around keeps you on your toes more...jazz's things up a bit!  You are going to go on a strange trip, so grab a cocktail, sit back and buckle up...you are in for a long strange ride...YE-HAAAA!  First of all I must confess that I am the worst writer in the world, my grammar, punctuation and spelling are atrocious. It doesn't matter that there is spell check on this...it just don't matter! I am hopeless!!!!  I feel very old but I know I really am not. I am only 42, well I will be 43 soon. I am a single female, well not really single. I am in a relationship and have been for almost 6 years. My relationship is with another female who is 3 yrs. younger than me. What is age? Just a number. I don't look my age. I look maybe 5-6 yrs. younger than I am if not more on a really good day! Now my body feels like it is 143, which is a shame and that's a novel in itself.  I feel like I am such a failure and a disappointment to my mom, my partner and myself. I have some sisters, 3 to be exact but it don't really matter, they aren't much better. I think of them as 3 peas in a pod all fighting for lead pea! I don't care what they think about me or my life style. I think I am disappointed in life myself...Is this it? Is this all I get? Well if it is I want a refund or I would even settle on an exchange! I know it isn't really fair to say ""IS THIS ALL I GET"" It is the cards I have been dealt, its no ones fault that I haven't done something with myself and my life, not anyones fault but my own. Have I been lazy? I think so. I also think some of it has to do with no encouragement in my younger years. I was really good at the artsy stuff in school. As a matter of fact the art classes are the only classes that I did good in and actually got a's...A+'S at that. As for all the other classes I was lucky to get D's. I had no interest in anything other than art when I was younger. Had I had encouragement who knows where I might be right now instead of here. But no matter what, how I have turned out, how my life is right now is my doing and no one else's. I could have pushed myself to go to school, to make better job choices and to do a bunch of things differently. I guess I blame myself. I have to.

"What’s the point of coming up if you’re gonna go down? I moved to a new city with the love of my life after 5 years of loving him. I was ready to propose, I looked at rings, I called jewelers. I debated getting a ring of meteorite, you know? He’s super nerdy, super cute. Science geek and all. I’d like to think every guy buying rings thinks about the meteorite ring haha.  Then he tells me that he feels like a she. I loved her no matter what. I told her I still loved her and that she’s going to be one of the most beautiful girls ever. I still planned to propose. I loved her more that she’s her true self.  Then my heart gets broken. She tells me that she can’t see a future with me together. She tells me that she’s only interested in women. There wasn’t much for me to do but respect her true feelings. I couldn’t force her to love me. For a few weeks I lost my best-friend and my future.   We still lived together, music helped, weed helped. I made friends. I tried to be happy, and for a little I think I really was okay. But it was so stormy, one tip of the scale and I was back to being broken.   Then I find out that she’s seeing other guys. My heart was gone, the only feeling is that feeling when your heart drops to your stomach. It’s a little harder to swallow, did life get harder? Did she make it easier? I don’t know. I wasn’t good enough for her. She says otherwise. I know she means the best for me with her heart but man, did it hurt the same.  I ask her to give me time, as a roommate, as a past lover, give me time to heal before you see someone. Please, just give me some time to heal.   But she couldn’t wait. I don’t blame her, she’s discovering herself. She’s beautiful. I never had a chance. There are better men for her. I’m broken, the pieces stomped on.   I try. I go to work. I exercise. I eat healthy. I tell myself “improve for yourself and no one else”. It’s a lie.  Life seems to drag on, I try to smile, I miss my best friend. I try to act like everything’s alright to her. She can’t be seeing me like this, it hurts her too.  I meet a guy. He’s cute, a little simple, but cute. We start to hang out, workout together even. He takes me to some of the most beautiful places, I try to swallow my doubt and bring my heart back. Somedays, I could swallow just fine around him.   When I was sure I was ready, I told him. It was too late. I took too long.  I was just dead. I made plans, wrote good bye letters, planned that my little siblings would get what money I had left. I know it’s selfish, I know it can get better. I even tried to find a program that sends emails at a certain time so everyone could get a good nights sleep before they received my letter.   I couldn’t do it. I stood on the edge of a bridge, the edge of a cliff, wore my favorite clothes. Listened to my favorite songs. Every time I couldn’t do it. You never think of it as someone being brave. But I was scared, I couldn’t imagine how anyone took that step off, pulled the trigger, kicked the chair. They had to be brave.  And now, I’m back. I’m ready to kick the chair, I’m ready to pull the trigger, I’m ready to jump.

You see, I had an abortion just months before she became pregnant and ever since then she has been off with me. She gives me looks every time I go near her son or even when I attempt to smile at her.

" I've had United Healthcare as my health insurer for 7 years. For the past 6 years they have dutifully paid 80% of my weekly visits to my psychiatrist without any problem. Then, quite suddenly last August, they stopped paying my doctor anything for my visits. The insurer say that I'm only entitled to 30 mental health visits per year according to the contract, but my doctor insists that the insurer is required to forewarn her and me the patient when benefits are about to expire. Neither of us received any notice that my benefits were about to expire. My doctor and I have written letters and called the insurer asking them appeal my case, but they refuse to allow me any more benefits for visits. So I'm going to have to pay my doctor about $4,000 out of pocket.   Is there anything else I can do to fight my insurance company? My doctor and I both feel blindsided by the insurer and are furious.

"When people say dont quit SSRIs, listen to them I was put on 20mg Lexapro through my university's health center, but summer rolled around and since I wasnt taking a physical class (online ones dont qualify you for student insurance apparently) I had to pay ~$400 for coverage in the summer in addition to actually paying for my prescriptions.

" I'm trying to understand a couple of things of wildly different importance.  First post is baseball.  Major League Baseball's insistence that their All-Star game decide which league receives the privelege of home field advantage in the World Series is ridiculous.  This policy blows my mind.  There are so many inequities in allowing a collection of individuals from different teams to come together and decide an important post-season rule such as home field advantage.  First of all, as evidenced by last night's debacle, one person's failure can crush an entire league's hopes.  Roger Clemens comes in and lays an egg and the next thing you know the National League doesn't have a chance.  This year's example is particularly strange, since A.L. batters came into the game with the luxury of having faced Clemens multiple times—something most N.L. hitters could not say about their encounter with Mark Mulder to start the game.  Also, because of MLB's insistence that at least one player from each team be represented, players with no real vested interest in which league gets home field advantage are deciding the outcome.  I doubt Livan Hernandez is particularly concerned with the post-season this year.  So if he faces someone like Derek Jeter, the stakes are unequal to the point of unfairness.  Another thing about all of the ""This Time it Counts"" garbage is the fact that the game is still played like an exhibition.  If the game is really supposed to count, then I want Barry Bonds in for the whole game.  I don't want Roger Clemens pitching on a couple hours of sleep because of all of his All-Star festivity obligations.  I want Mike Piazza, not Johnny Estrada (no offense to the promising young catcher), trying to make up a 5-run deficit.  I mean, I'm a Cubs fan.  They have a chance to play in the World Series and it makes a huge difference to the club and fans alike whether more games are played at Wrigley Field.  But that point is moot because the All-Star game is supposed to be an exhibition.  What would be the point of naming Estrada as an All-Star if he didn't get a chance to play.  It's all just stupid.  It's an idea that never should have been let out of the think tank.  Baseball should take a page from the NBA and NFL.

 Today was a regular school day. I got to school and survived through Mr.Perez going on about Jewish law. Then I went to Web Design and watched a pretty interesting video on the history of the internet. After a short break I showed up for Biology and did really good on our quiz. Thats when things started going down hill. When I got into fourth period I had a really bad headache. Then at lunch by the time i got my food it was time to go to class. Spanish and Algebra were easy. Then came AVID. I had to listen to my new AVID teacher talk about how things are going to be different this year. We've been going over this for the past four days. It's getting pretty old. Well after that I came home did my homework and started on this. Thats about everything that happened to me today. ,0,today regular school day got school survived mrperez going jewish law went web design watched pretty interesting video history internet short break showed biology did really good quiz thats thing started going hill got fourth period really bad headache lunch time got food time class spanish algebra easy came avid listen new avid teacher talk thing going different year going past day getting pretty old came home did homework started this thats happened today
"I suffer from major depression too and I have taken almost all of the SSRI's but the only one that really helped me was Lexapro. I took it for around 2 month's, then decided that I didn't want to become addicted to another medication so I just stopped taking it and it didn't bother me at all. I have been taking 100 mil of Elavil at bedtime which is also an antidepressant but I take it to help me sleep. It used to help control my depression but it doesn't anymore and really doesn't help me sleep either. Have you ever tried Lexapro? I think it's the best SSRI one can be on and I had no side effects while taking it so you might want to ask your doctor about it. If there is an alternative treatment for major depression I would like to know what it is. I really have no reason to be depressed as I have a very loving, supportive husband 4 wonderful children, 10 grandchildren and 6 great-grand children. Both my husband and I are retired and this is a time when I should really be enjoying my life but there is a void which I can't explain. I don't want for anything. I have a beautiful home, a new Durango but the material things aren't what makes one happy. I've been told that one chooses to be happy or unhappy but I certainly don't choose to be unhappy and I don't know anyone who would. I am a devout Christian and I know that my depression isn't coming from God but I'm letting the Devil tell me that I'm depressed. Maybe God is just trying to bring me closer to Him and I need to lay my burden of depression at His feet and tell him that I can't get through this alone, then just forget about it but for me it isn't that easy. Three of my 4 children are taking antidepressants so I guess depression might be hereditary (spelling?). I will pray for you to feel better and will you please pray for me too? Thank you.",1,suffer major depression taken ssri really helped lexapro took month is decided did not want addicted medication just stopped taking did not bother all taking mil elavil bedtime antidepressant help sleep used help control depression doe not anymore really doe not help sleep either tried lexapro think best ssri effect taking want ask doctor it alternative treatment major depression like know is really reason depressed loving supportive husband wonderful child grandchild greatgrand child husband retired time really enjoying life void explain not want anything beautiful home new durango material thing not make happy told chooses happy unhappy certainly not choose unhappy not know would devout christian know depression not coming god letting devil tell depressed maybe god just trying bring closer need lay burden depression foot tell alone just forget not easy child taking antidepressant guess depression hereditary spelling pray feel better pray too thank you

"I lost my best friend. My best friend used to always be there for me, he was the barnyard kind of personality, with tonnes of love and compassion for everyone around him, and along him was excitement and exploration. We used to explore the woods together and sometimes sit and stare at the campfire for hours until we fell asleep together.  His name was Archer, he was my cat, and he was my best friend. A woodland animal killed him, he was defenseless..  I've tried with different cats to fill the empty void, but they were never aware of me. Archer was always where I was, and were going.

"The base is 3 bound boxes of Remerol tablets (similar to Effexor). Above that is my trusty 300 mg slow release wellbutrin. Next, Sonata for occasional use; and then onto concerta per my request. Finally there is Risperdal and Topemax - a headache medication.  I tried to kill myself last spring and came very, very close. This event has opened up spiritual dimensions more terrible than I thought possible. Forgive me for sounding weird, but with my life just one little hop, one small step away from obliteration, the return back became a long journey. And most of me didn't even make it back - after the attempt I was hospitalized on a ward with a sociopath as my neighbor. I was naive and even befriended him. Far too late in the relationship I realized that this person may not have my best interests in hand. So I left the hospital but I left beaten. Then I went home to my family and some of them reacted terribly against my illness. I felt powerless, like I was spreading some miserable disease. My struggle goes on but at least I am alive. I believe in many things I never used to now, and that gives me hope.  To anyone reading this, I just hope you won't toy with your life. Live a long one, it's important you do.

(The ending is supposed to sound funny, it was the only thing that made me laugh and give me that final push thought of pulling myself out of this horrible hole I was in tonight)   Tonight, under a drunken wine induced depression, followed by the realization that someone I trust had betrayed it and lack of anti depressants, i seriously considered slitting my wrists in the bathroom. While sobbing with my hands in my face, trying to figure out who would take care of my son and my unpaid debt, I looked up to see my cat staring at me. She has this stern, mothering expression in her eyes, and we locked eyes for the longest time. She kept my gaze until my sobbing was under control and I really thought about my actions. Maybe she just wanted wet food.   I am really bad at remembering to take my meds, and usually the day or two where I forget doesn't have this effect on me, but for the pile of emotional shit dealt to me the last week or so, apparently it did.

" Well tonight things finally came to a collapse. Erika has finally decided she can't try and hold on to what we have had going for over 3 years. After a long talk on the phone, and her broken down in tears, many kind words exchanged back and forth, a little bit of laughter now and then, but mostly silence, trying to decide what to say. She has decided to stick with Troy because he is there for her, since i live 8 hours away. My heart was broken, after 3 years of keeping it going. I will cherish the last time i saw her, only 3 weeks ago, driving 8 hours leaving at 1 in the morning on a spur of the moment to go see her because my parents were out of town. Spending a whole day, and night with her was the most amazing thing i have ever experienced. After cuddeling all night, and falling asleep, we woke up early in the morning, and both started getting closer. Eventually, we ended up making sweet love for the first time which is the most amazing thing i have ever experienced with her. Only a few hours later i had to go home. Then, tonight, i found out that the big pit i was feeling in my stomach the other night was true. This past weekend she went and did it with Troy....I cant explain how i felt. I know they were dating but i was shocked. We talked some more, trying to work things out, but you know it doesnt work out that great. Both said a few things we shouldnt. She wanted to try and get rid of our emotions for each other, she said all her stuff, then i asked her if she really wanted me to say how i felt, and she said yes. After a long time of me talking, she was shocked of how much i really felt for her because this was truely the first time i was able to tell her i dreamed, and wanted to marry her someday. But, i was too late. She is with troy for the past couple months, if only i could have told her sooner my true feelings, but i didnt; now i am too late to care for her, she said its over forever. Hopefully i will still be able to talk to her. Night ended with a long silence, i could hear her crying in the background, a long silence, and the line goes dead. I am dieing, and really need to talk to her, call once, twice, 5 times, 7 times, 4 voicemails later, i give up, give one last call to tell her sweet dreams and have a good day at school.

"I feel like shit Hello everyone and happy new lunar year!   Here is my story: I just came back from a casino joined by my family members only, we were having a great time together and everybody were well entertained. Things were smoothly going until I committed a foul as a result of my lack of understanding about a certain kind of  gambling. Therefore, some of the participants of mine lost a small amount of their bet cash (likely because of my foul) and they said it was my fault. I was embarrassed because of my ignorance and I would have apologized each of them but I couldn't do it, I still feel I am guilty now.

"I would love to talk about dreams. Only thing is for every dream, there can be a hundred interpretations. Or so has been my experience. I always say that I will keep paper and pen next to me at night, so when I have a dream I want to remember (like last night)... I'll write it down so I won't forget. But I don't do this because when I wake up I think I can remember...no problem! After all, a lot of these dreams are so profound that how could I possibly forget them... guess what??? I almost always forget the words that meant so much to me in the dream. I remember the subject matter, but it's the words many times that I want to remember. So here goes my dream from last night (or early this morning)... A little background first for those who don't know or remember who I am... my mother died quite suddenly from her leukemia in April 2004. We were at odds with each other at the time. I started taking care of my elderly father at the time and he died this past August 2005. I've been wanting to dream about my mother and feel her presence and love since she died. I've only had a few dreams about her, maybe 4... And they have all been upsetting, never ""nice feeling"" dreams. Last night I had a dream of my mother. She was pregnant and ready to deliver her baby. She looked younger (she was almost 82 at her death) but in the dream ""we"" knew she was older like she was alive today. She said ""I'm ok now I'm going to have a baby At least I think this is what she said. My dad was in my dream as was my dad's cousin, who is also deceased. My mother's cousin-in-law was in the dream and she was sobbing. This same woman was crying out of control at my mother's funeral. We were at a hotel in Disneyland. Ok everyone. What does this mean?",1,love talk dream thing dream interpretation experience say paper pen night dream want remember like night write not forget not wake think rememberno problem all lot dream profound possibly forget them guess what forget word meant dream remember subject matter word time want remember go dream night or early morning little background not know remember am mother died quite suddenly leukemia april odds time started taking care elderly father time died past august wanting dream mother feel presence love died dream her maybe upsetting nice feeling dream night dream mother pregnant ready deliver baby looked younger she death dream we knew older like alive today said i ok going baby think said dad dream dad cousin deceased mother cousininlaw dream sobbing woman cry control mother funeral hotel disneyland ok everyone doe mean
"I've been reading the ""hoarding"" thread in the OCD forum and I'm jealous.

"How do I end this, or can I fix it? ok, so it's kinda a long story.. but me and my best friend met in high school, we clicked right away, there was this bond ( and kinda still is? ) between us, we would never separate, always talking etc. Still in highschool she cut me out of her life sudendly for a whole year. I dont know why I continue trying to talk to her, but maybe it would have been better for us if it had end there, and eventually she came around and asked to go out with her, we didnt talk at all about that, she just gave me a note saying why she did that, wich honestly didnt tell much except saying she has depression and didnt know what she was doing...She said she always hurts everyone so she cut me out. Years later, we didnt talk that much as before, but were still really good friends, then I started to notice that me or other friends counldn say anything to her if it was something that upset her. Sometimes it was so stupid that she got mad at me because I didnt agree with her opinion over an actor... She would rage in games with everyone, and stop talking.. now the part that hurts me like hell is that she would cut us all out of her life, for like weeks, then come back like nothing happen. She would never tell me whats wrong, if I tried to talk about more serious stuff she would step away again. Eventually I got tired, and told her that we couldnt go on like this.   So I stoped talking to her, 2 months later I decided to give another shot, what happen was exactly the same. So I stoped talking again, and I though it was for good, we only talked when we were with all our friends etc. Then I learnt a few months later that she wanted to commit suicide. She actually tried it, said her mom, and was admited to an hospital. I was heart broken, thinking about losing her forever took over my jugdment... So I went to the hospital, and we talk normally. Then after she got out we had a conversation, face to face, about her stoping doing all that to me, she said she was going to try, and promised me, PROMISED ME that she would tell me when something was wrong, or when she would like to be left alone so I didnt worry as much, and that she would talk to me if I ever said something wrong about her. Everything was going great, amazing really. I could tell she was better with her medicine and all, but that only last 3 months. Now she had a problem with a boy she likes or something, pretended that everything was ok, despited her answers said otherwise, and started ignoring me. I was mad and said, some things never change, and she responded to me saying she was a lost cause. I wrote a whole text to her saying I want to be her friend, but that will only work as long as shes honest with me and stops pushing me away... she wanst answered yet. she also never said to me that shes sorry she hurts me, even thoug I say that to her when I hurt her. I feel like Im in a toxic relationship, that I always find my way back in again. Is there a way to fix this? or should I just give up for good?",0,end this fix it ok kinda long story best friend met high school clicked right away bond kinda is u separate talking etc highschool cut life sudendly year dont know continue trying talk her maybe better end there eventually came asked her didnt talk that just gave note saying did that wich honestly didnt tell saying depression didnt know doingshe said hurt cut out year later didnt talk before really good friend started notice friend counldn say upset her stupid got mad didnt agree opinion actor rage game everyone stop talking hurt like hell cut life like week come like happen tell whats wrong tried talk stuff step away again eventually got tired told like this stoped talking her month later decided shot happen exactly same stoped talking again good talked friend etc learnt month later wanted commit suicide actually tried it said mom admited hospital heart broken thinking losing forever took jugdment went hospital talk normally got conversation face face stoping doing me said going try promised me promised tell wrong like left didnt worry much talk said wrong her going great amazing really tell better medicine all month problem boy like something pretended ok despited answer said otherwise started ignoring me mad said thing change responded saying lost cause wrote text saying want friend work long shes honest stop pushing away wanst answered yet said shes sorry hurt me thoug say hurt her feel like im toxic relationship way again way fix this just good

"I always wanted to go to the therapy but my very huge and overprotective gossip-loving family made this impossible for me to do Not only that but even a little hypothetical talk about it would instantly gain unnecessary panic like attention and after several phone calls to friends, family members with something like *""Hey Clara, he wants to go to the therapist. Is this normal? Which one should we call? Do you know anyone? Ask John please!""* And next day there will be several people touching my hand and saying ""Hey are you fine?"" Making it feel like something is wrong with me when I just want to talk to a professional in person without feeling like a babe.   How do I know? Because my sister was depressed once and I've seen how everyone reacted to it. You see, my family's  never changing mentality is ""we need to fight together! We are there for you (goddamn Fairy Tail guild or something)"". I don't blame them and I bet there are people who'd exchange everything only to be with someone as supportive. But I have always hated attention so much since I remember my self as a kid. Ironically enough I've had the biggest birthday parties in the town to boost this 'weird' hate.   Doing it secretly will be risky because I actually work in my family's business as well so my tight schedule and the fact that my town is pretty small makes this almost impossible. And if someone finds out I secretly go to talk to a doctor it will have even worse reaction than just straight out telling them.   Maybe I'm overreacting and have too much pride in me or no balls to admit to my family but sometimes I wish I could get invisible for just a week to sort my inner problems out. Sorry If this feels like I'm trying to make it harder for you guys to make some suggestions. It's way more complicated than that I just wanted to let it out. I've read some posts here and some of them were so so dark that my problems actually fade away a bit and I felt better because I said to my self *""yo... you are being a bitch right now, look at these people suffering here, you aren't even close!""* (don't know if I'm being terrible for healing my little wounds by reading how other people suffer). Anyways, Idk why I haven't visited this sub earlier, as I type these last words I already feel better because it is the first time I'm doing something like this. Feels like I've talked to someone.

"No one has a monopoly on suffering.  We keep living our lives because depression is pain and illness is suffering, but both don't happen without something happening to us. It is at these times that we are changing in some way...Suffering can give us greater empathy and understanding.  It can strip away all the other stuff.  So many say they will always be depressed ... that may or may not be the case but everyone has right to live their lives ... suffering included.  However, there is a vast difference between simply suffering from depression and finding the courage to live with long term / cyclical depression.  You can, learn to live with depression.  It may profoundly change your life ... take much away from you, but you can learn to live with it.  Long term depression isn't static ... like any illness, it changes.  But we know depression is different because it so cruelly takes away our hope of a brighter future.  But be stubborn and it will change again. To state in a forum like this, that you want to end it all is a big responsibility to place on the shoulders of other people.  It hands the possibility of that personal choice on to others .... which is unfair. Genuine suffering can bring more empathy and awareness of the plight of others in similar situations. There are times when i feel like ending my life and the thoughts nudge at me constantly but I recognize them now for what they are: the depression talking.  With each episode I have learnt new ways to try and tag these thoughts.  Ultimately ... the illness is happening to me / the thoughts happen to me.  But I would not burden others with the knowledge of their presence.  It is only afterwards that i might mention that i had these constant thoughts, because to tell them in the middle of the depression would only darken their lives as much as the depression is darkening my own. Please think before you make threats of suicide in the chat room or forums.  There is an increasing number of people using this technique of gaining attention but it is unfair.  by all means we can talk about it .... but saying : ""i'm going to do it."" is simply selfish and smacks of attention seeking. Such behavior is destroying the integrity of genuine sufferers of depression in the eyes of so many.  It is eroding the help which is so lacking for so many ... and is probably the reason why the mental health hospital near me is a relic from the 60's and yet the cancer department is brand new and state of the art. Please .... stop attention seeking and stop using ""depression"" as a convenient coat hanger for emotional immaturity and lack of personal responsibility. For so many people ... this really is a matter of life and death.

"I feel sad. It is 1.46 am and I haven't gone to bed yet. Instead I am sitting here at the computer half heartedly trying to be part of the chat room, tears falling down my face. I feel so sad I can't even be bothered to reach for my phone to remove the razor from the back, or go down stairs for a bottle of wine. It makes me feel worse that this is been going on for so long that even the pathetic depressive coping skills have no effect on me. Pure pessimism, not even the chance of some temporary relief through an OD or spilt blood. Why did they seem to offer relief 3, 5, 6 years ago? I tried to eat normally today, I really tried. I failed though. I am trying to see myself properly, or at least come to the realization that I am not vile and unattractive, and obese. It still ends up with food all over the toilet. I disgust myself so much. I disgust myself because I let myself eat. I disgust myself because I think as I do, and I know that eating should be considered normal, but I can't see it like that. I disgust myself because I covered the toilet bowl in bits of chewed up food and stomach acid. I don't know what to say any more. I wish some one would say that I am going to feel better, but I've had that for the last 7 years, and I'd probably just be cynical any way. This post was pathetic, I'm sorry.

" ""Marriage, Marriage is what brings us together, today."" -- The Princess Bride      Women can be frustrating. My girlfriend and I just had a very important discussion two weeks ago about getting married. She then left to go on vacation for two weeks with her family. Since she leff, I keep thinking that she will say she doesn't love me and doesn't want to marry me. I've told her I love her and that I want to marry her but haven't yet proposed.      She is the type that likes to know all about what's going to happen before it happens. So she asked me all about the future and what I think about when we should get married and what will happen after that. I told her I want to marry her in December. She objects because she is a school teacher (like me)and that is a busy time of year. I'm okay with doing it another time (like June) but I love her so much and want to begin my life with her right now.      Anyway, I'm ultimately worried that she will get scared and run away. But I'm probably being stupid and untrusting. She cares very much for me and I know that for sure, so I should just be content with that.

It took me a long time to realize that it was an unhealthy friendship because I was in denial.  But even my friends and family kept telling me that I need to break it off because it was affecting me in such a radical way. I will always remember him. ,0,wow today hard day stop friend best friend unhealthy friendship glad did it took long time realize unhealthy friendship denial friend family kept telling need break affecting radical way remember him
"GF stopped taking antidepressants So my LDR girlfriend just recently stopped taking antidepressants because her mother pressured her into it. She clearly needs them, she can barely function without them and I told her but she refuses to take them again. Her mother, by the way, is bipolar and very mentally abusive. It seems like my GF had been convinced by her mother that not taking meds is the way to go. I told my parents about this and they agree with her not taking them, claiming it’ll help the “chemicals leave her body.” I don’t know what to do. I want to support her decision but her getting off her meds is clearly affecting her negatively and she’s even sadder and less motivated to do anything now. It’s currently impossible for us to live together and we visit each other 1-2 times a year when school is out. We’re both in uni.   I myself stopped taking antidepressants cold turkey as well (that was about 5 years ago) and I’m still depressed but not to the point where I can’t go out and do what I’m supposed to like she is experiencing right now. I love her and want to be with her forever but I don’t know how to help at this point, she’s not receptive to my help and hates herself and has no friends where she lives, a small town in Canada.",1,gf stopped taking antidepressant ldr girlfriend just recently stopped taking antidepressant mother pressured it clearly need them barely function told refuse again mother way bipolar mentally abusive like gf convinced mother not taking med way go told parent agree not taking them claiming help chemical leave body not know do want support decision getting med clearly affecting negatively sadder motivated now currently impossible live visit time year school out uni stopped taking antidepressant cold turkey that year ago depressed not point supposed like experiencing right now love want forever not know help point not receptive help hate friend life small town canada
"“Best friend” didn’t invite me to celebrate 21st. I’ve been friends with this girl for over ten years. We were our first best friends. We ended up going to different schools throughout high school and college, but we never drifted too far.  Yesterday, she turned 21. She was coming into town to go to a local bar, but I’m not of age yet. She told me I could come, but I figured she was just going to be there with her boyfriend and other friends who are 21. I didn’t want to sit there drinking a Sprite while they all got drunk, so I let her enjoy her evening. I figured she would celebrate later again anyway (which she is.)  Today, she posts on her Snapchat story her and all our mutual friends (underage friends) drinking and having fun over in one of our friends apartments. I was not invited. I got her a gift and was ready to celebrate with her. I’m pretty disappointed, hurt, and feeling lame as usual.  This has been a common theme for the past couple of years. She hangs with a select group of about 5 or 6 people who I’ve known longer than her. I don’t really get invited to anything at all, only once in a blue moon. She sometimes tries to hang out with me when she comes into town from college.  Is it time to take a huge step back from this friendship? I don’t feel appreciated and I feel the effort is not there. Any advice?

" I've been having trouble sleeping.  Well, not really.  I can sleep allright but I have these Godawful dreams that wake me up.  They aren't even the scary kind that are at least interesting to think about the next day.

"Helping a girlfriend with depression possibly? Hello,  I want to first off say this is a throwaway. I also looked for similar post regarding what I will ask, but i really want a tailored answer for my own sanity. Sorry for being selfish, this is just hard. I have been dating this girl for almost a year and I know she has been slipping into an abyss of what I cannot diagnose, but seems like depression. I will start with a time table.  We began dating after meeting on a popular dating app and we hit it off fast. Similar interest, goals, outlooks, expectations, and lifestyle. We became extremely close with in two months and then out of the blue she tells me its over. I didn't feel it was a justifiable way to end the relationship. I contacted her and we had long winded email correspondence with in which she had this quote to me "" I feel lost at work, lost in my personal life, and just lost with trying to find my happiness. You do make me happier. And idk what just snapped last week but I was super depressed all week .""  I talked with her and we set small goals to rekindle and help her find her happiness. We got back together with in two weeks and that started a prolonged honeymoon period for which we traveled, went on ski trips, took our dogs on hikes, and generally enjoyed ourselves.  This continued until march or 2018, when I noticed her slipping back in to her just overall never satisfied state. I got worried and tried to lightly push her to no avail. I then tried to make plans at least twice a month to help distract her and give her a solid thing to look forward to. She never changed and just got worse to the point where the last 2 months, she gets home from work smokes enough weed to put me to sleep, eats too much and then goes to sleep by 9. I tried to encourage by proxy by going to the gym and going to parks with her dog and taking pictures and even getting closer with her family. nothing worked.  Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, she went to Sweden on a vacation with her best friend and had a blast and was calling me everyday so happy and excited. I thought we had a legitimate break through. Then one week before she returns i start to only get 1 or 2 text a day, I figure she is living her best life to busy with international travel to communicate regularly like she requested.  She returns and we spend one night together and she calls me at school to come over to her place asap. she dumps me with little to no explanation. I met with her once more to voice my opinion and she was just quiet and had nothing to say but sorry and that i deserve someone who loves me like Love her. Today she starts emailing me about how she just needs space and she wants me to still talk to her family.  I really do not know what to think...  My friends say fuck her move on.  I have never had a connection or love for someone outside my family and I have had at least 3 relationships over 2 years (I am almost 30). This one really felt different, the way she looked in my eyes and the way we talked about all our joint desires, just felt so good.  I just want everyone to know I am open to honest responses and please feel free to speak openly, I just hurt because I feel like this is when she needs me most, but also might just need her own time to figure her self out.

I think my friends ditched me. I was recently doing a mass unfollowing on Instagram and I noticed a lot of people that I went to high school and college with are no longer following me. Same thing with Facebook. I don’t blame them because I’m boring and they are either married with kids or they’re just out to the hottest bar or club every damn weekend. I don’t drink nor am I in a relationship or married. Where does a 29 year old go to make new friends and even find the love of their life? I failed to find her in school or work. Am I just doomed to roam the planet a loner who only can have internet friends. Sure it’s cool at first but I need real friends to talk to and someone to marry for real.

"Why depression is, and isn't like a skinned knee: Some thoughts I had that I wanted to share I was just pondering depression, and I decided to jot down what I was thinking. It's sort of a good way to put words to what it feels like to suffer from depression.  ____________________________________  Why it IS like a skinned knee:   Depression usually comes in episodes for me, and a lot of people I've talked to. Sometimes I'll be doing okay, and then have a really bad day, or even a bad week.   These episodes are sort of like skinning your knee. When you were little, skinning your knee feels like the absolute worst thing in the world. You think, ""OW, THIS HURTS SO MUCH! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?!""   You feel so helpless.   When you're an adult and skin your knee, you know what to do. You know that you're supposed to clean it, and put a bandage on it. And that's exactly what you do; you don't make a fuss.   But, even though you clean it and bandage it, it's of course still going to hurt. It's a cut. You just ignore the pain, though, because you've already taken care of it, and there's not much else you can do beyond that. You just have to live with the fact that it's going to hurt for a while.   Depression is the exact same way. When it happens, you know what you should do to handle it. The best way, backed by science and research, is what we've all heard countless times: Exercise, eat healthy, do something nice for yourself, clean your living space, listen to happy music, watch TV shows that make you happy, etc.   So you know to do this stuff. But of course, it's not going to magically feel 100% better right off the bat. There's still that emotional pain there, just like the way a skinned knee stings. But you've already done everything you can to take care of it, so you have to live with it and wait patiently for the pain to go away.   ______________________________________________   Why depression ISN'T like a skinned knee:   Most people know that depression has a way of demotivating sufferers. Things you once enjoyed no longer interest you. Nothing seems like it has a point.   But this also affects your drive to treat your depression. When you skin your knee, you just take care of it right away, you don't give any second thought to it. It's just what you do. With depression, you know that you should be exercising, eating healthy, listening to happy music, cleaning, etc. But you don't. What's the point?    The difference is, that depression makes you NOT want to get better, or more accurately, not care about getting better. Sometimes, you're just apathetic and nihilistic, ""What's the point? I don't care. Getting better is too much effort."" Sometimes, you just want to wallow in your own despair. For me, when I feel this way, it's because I feel worthless and self-loathing. I think, ""I deserve to feel this way. I deserve this emotional pain that I'm going through. I don't deserve to feel better, or to be happy.""   That's the vicious cycle that depression uses to keep you down.   If you are reading this and have depression, I hope this helps you understand your own illness a little more clearly. If you're reading this and you don't have depression, I hope this gives you a good account of what it's like, so you can empathize with people who have depression.   Stay safe, everyone.

"I have now had BAD night sweats on and off for about 4 years. I am only 32, so it's not menopause and at this point I am pretty sure they are from my antidepressants. I have now tried about 4 - 5 different antidepressants to try to get rid of them but nothing has worked. About 4 years ago I got night sweats when I tried Zoloft which is known for causing them, so I switched to Prozac which never caused them and I was fine, for awhile. Then one day I just started getting night sweats and over the years I tried to get rid of them by switching to Wellbutrin, Effexor, Serzone (I think) and Cymbalta to no avail. My night sweats get worse depending on the season and humidity. At their worst, which as been for the past 2 weeks since the weather change, I am soaked all night, clothing, sheets, pillows, blankets - everything. Then I freeze when I get up to change my clothes or go to the bathroom because I am soaking wet.  I am basically at the end of my rope. I no longer know what to do and my doctor's just choked it up to my antidepressants so they say there is nothing I can do.  Has anybody gone through this and found a solution? Help please.

"I'm new to these boards and I hope I'm posting in the right spot...I have been diagnosed with major recurring depression since 1992. I have a host of chronic, painful auto-immune related diseases. I am also trying to care for an ill family member who just got out of the hospital and had major surgery (takes a year to recover from this surgery). This family member is pretty much bedridden and needs to be bathed, fed, and cared for much the way a private duty nurse would. It is a daunting task for me under the circumstances. Insurance will not pay for long term care and we cannot afford even the cheapest of help. Hence, I am managing all of it alone. Once in a blue moon, my in-laws will help but are very resentful on the rare occasion that I ask for help. My house is cluttered (I saw that topic) and I'm not sure if its because I'm so depressed or because I have been sick too much to take care of it. I think perhaps its both. I know that at least some of my depression is situational, but I also know that some of it is not. I am on medication, but the medicines have never done a whole lot for me. I've tried them all.

He was my good friend, He could tell me anything, problems with his girlfriend or school, I could also tell him anything, I thought that I could trust him. I was wrong. He told you lies so that way he could be cool and I would be a fool. So this is how I feel. Right now I'm not thinking about what we could have had, Because you are not worth it. Why would I want someone who tells lies? Why would I want someone that can't respect me?

"Hello, my name is Joe and I have been battling some form of depression, but I do not know what type or how severe it is. I have a family history of bipolar depression but I am not sure if this is a disease that is genetic to such an extent. Does it skip generations? My moods swing from euphoria to deep depression to where I contemplate just cutting away from my life and vanish. I am not suicidal; just feel at times isolation is the answer. I have one trigger I know of and it is usually when I am lacking in knowledge of a current situation I may be in. This make sense? Like tonight, I am out of town on business and working very late on some complex worksheets. I started getting depressed after the 12th hour of working and getting nowhere. This will then lead to insomnia and I will once again, for the second night in a row, be up all night working and mind wandering contemplating just getting in my car and driving to a remote town and re-invent myself. I have tried professional help, but to no avail I am just as bad if not worse. I figured since I am online most the day I would search for a forum that might lead me on a better path. After all shucking corn in Nebraska for room and board isn't such a great option the next morning.

"Hi everyone! I've been trying to find something or someone to help me out depression for ages, but I'm not an open person and it's been very difficult for me. I was never happy with my life and been just running away from problems. I left home when I was 18 and went to London. I wanted to start new life, but moved 11 times since then and always hoped I'll be happy in the new place. But it's getting worse and worse, I'm back home now, and start to realize, that I have nowhere to run and I'm getting old for that. I had a best friend in London, but she just used me and left when my ex went to jail. I have no one to talk to and I found so difficult to find new friends. I never talk about my problems, just to myself, when I'm with people, I'm completely different person, I'm so shy and I hate it. I hate it when I want to say something, but my mind doesn't let me and I'm just upset on myself. I don't remember the morning, when I woke up with a good mood or without headache. I've been thinking so much, that even when I stop I still feel this horrible pain in my head. I tried to bring my confidence up with drugs, but they just made it worse and I feel even more depressed. I've been thinking everyday. What am I going to do? and what is the worse about all this is that when I decide something what I feel is right and in few hours or minutes I think about it again and my feelings change and change again. ...it's driving me crazy. I'm getting so sensitive on everything, I'm crying from watching a stupid cartoon, or listening to the music, I feel sick or strange high on everything I put in my mouth. I think I've lost myself, I can't see the point of life anymore. Suicide? I tried that, but now I'm afraid of death, I'm afraid of everything.

"I'm 17 years old I live in the metro Detroit area and I have had depression for the past 5 years, my parents refuse to admit I have a problem, at one point I used to cut myself and at another point I was rushed to the ER to get my stomach pumped from trying to over dose. Basically I joined this forum so I can realize for myself I'm not the only one with problems. My depression has gotten a lot better over the years as certain situations got better too; I have a loving boyfriend whom I have been with for 14 months now, which I'm extremely sure that he has helped me. Next year, well in the fall I will be moving away to college, which I actually think will be a good thing for me. I am also a cheerleader at my school, which doesn't help with my depression I am constantly under pressure about that. I'm also a dancer, my parents have this thing where they like to find every little thing I do wrong. It seems as if nothing I do is good enough or right. Which has lead to my wanting to be alone and not eating. With the stress of dance and cheerleading and my parents constantly telling me I'm fat has lead me to only eat once or twice every other day. I know it is not healthy and I know it is not good, but I personally think its better then cutting and better then trying to overdose on pain killers and every other pill in the house.

"Hi. I'm new, and I'm not really sure where to start in the forums! I've been treated for depression since I was 17 years old, and then misdiagnosed with ADD when I was 17 and that started a downward spiral with abusing Ritalin (snorting about 5-10 times my dosage) for about 5 years. That's over with. I battled with anorexia as a direct result of the Ritalin, and got down to 95 lbs. Then I ballooned up to 185 lbs. I lost 45 lbs. a few years ago and I've kept it off ever since (I've never gone above 144). I've been on Prozac since I was 17, and just recently switched to Cymbalta at the suggestion of my psychiatrist. I felt funny on it, and committed the ultimate sin: I stopped taking my medicines a week ago. I know that's bad. The last two days have been a nightmare, and I even contemplated swallowing a bottle of pills at one point. My fiance is the most amazing person in the world, and I'm literally killing him with my sickness. I don't know what to do. I've been hysterically crying and inconsolable for about a week. Yesterday my fiance called the psychiatrist on-call with our medical program, and she said I needed to take the Cymbalta, so I did take one pill yesterday and again this morning. I do feel weird, though. At the center of it all is my weight gain; I gained about 10ish pounds (I weigh 140 at the moment), and NONE of my clothes fit me. I feel like a disgusting fat blob all of the time. Just one look in the mirror sets me off and I'm HYSTERICAL for the rest of the day. All I want to do is sleep. SLEEP and never wake up. I've had an eating disorder in the past, and I know I can't fall back into it (the anorexia was a direct result of the Ritalin), but I am just hysterical, depressed, and I feel disgusting all day long. My clothes don't fit and I feel fat and disgusting and horrible and I want to cry and rip out my hair. I'm thinking this weight has a LOT to do with my recent downward turn in my depression, but I just can't lose the weight. I work out constantly and follow a really healthy/strict eating plan, and nothing is working. I'm just reaching the end of my rope, here. And to top it all off: I'm getting married next month. I need help...I've called my psychiatrist, but I don't know what to do. I don't see a psychologist; I think I need to, but I've had bad experiences in the past. I think I just need help and guidance and a way to lose this weight and feel good about myself. Hoping this forum will help.",1,hi new not really sure start forum treated depression year old misdiagnosed add started downward spiral abusing ritalin snorting time dosage year with battled anorexia direct result ritalin got lb ballooned lb lost lb year ago kept i gone prozac just recently switched cymbalta suggestion psychiatrist felt funny it committed ultimate sin stopped taking medicine week ago know bad day nightmare contemplated swallowing bottle pill point fiance amazing person world literally killing sickness not know do hysterically cry inconsolable week yesterday fiance called psychiatrist oncall medical program said needed cymbalta did pill yesterday morning feel weird though center weight gain gained ish pound i weigh moment clothes fit me feel like disgusting fat blob time just look mirror set hysterical rest day want sleep sleep wake up eating disorder past know fall the anorexia direct result ritalin just hysterical depressed feel disgusting day long clothes not fit feel fat disgusting horrible want rip hair thinking weight lot recent downward turn depression just lose weight work constantly follow really healthystrict eating plan working just reaching end rope here off getting married month need helpi called psychiatrist not know do not psychologist think need to bad experience past think just need help guidance way lose weight feel good myself hoping forum help

I'm so sick of reading replies to mine and other people's post about depression that try to oversimplify a serious mental illness that can cause suicide.  I swear everyone on this website assumes we do nothing to try to help ourselves. I really can't believe people are that misinformed that they really think that many people choose to be that miserable. You wouldn't choose to be miserable if you had the choice, and so would we. But we don't get that choice.  Then we have comments like ""Just put a life together that wont make you depressed"". I think these piss me off the most.

"I wish I could have done things differently I graduated high school in June of 2015. Currently I am attending community college and have been doing fairly well so far although I don't know how long I can keep it up. Back in high school I didn't try as hard as I could have resulting in lower grades thus barring my chances of getting into a four year university. Freshmen year of high school I saw my lowest gpa ever I had gotten a 1.8 gpa in the 2nd semester of that year. Hell I was dumb enough in my freshman year to think that I could get away with cheating in my ceramics class but I ended up getting caught. If the university applications saw that I got a D in an art class they would have thought I was a full on retard for trying to apply to a university. It was because of my second semester of freshmen year that I thought my chances of a four year were impossible. I also never bothered to do the ACT/SAT because I thought that with my low gpa it wouldn't have mattered anyway. The following years in hs I've managed to improve a bit but not all that much.      After high school ended I spent a year and a half not really knowing what I was doing taking a class at my community college here and there but not really committing, while also changing my major at least twice. If I play my cards right I'll be able to graduate by he end of May in 2019 and hopefully transfer to a university. But recently I can't help but think of how my life would have been if I had just went straight to a university after high school. I don't have any friends right now and I feel that if I had gone to university out of high school I would have had friends at this point.      Right after high school I didn't really have any second thoughts and what I was doing. I was fine with going to community college and transferring later on but right now I can't help but feel that I've made a huge mistake. If only I had done better in freshmen year I probably would have gotten accepted into university and had a completely different life. I'm only 21 and I already feel like a huge goddamn retard for how I acted in my high school life. If i had taken things more seriously my life right now would have been a lot better.      I feel like I have massively screwed myself. Most of the time now I think about what I could have done differently in high school and what my life would be like now. I honestly hate everything about myself and wish that I could just go back and make things right in high school.

I definitely think your right that my anxiety has sought out a fear that I dread more than any other and it is true that when I am not feeling depressed ( which incidentally is most of the time. This is only my second spell of depression in 39 years of life) I can mull over these thoughts and not be troubled with them in the slightest. It's really horrible how anxiety can feed off itself and lead you down this path to terrible thoughts. By the way when my partner was pregnant with our first child she to had dreams like yours and she was upset by them and she like you has turned out to be an attentive and first class mother.,1,definitely think right anxiety sought fear dread true not feeling depressed incidentally time second spell depression year life mull thought not troubled slightest really horrible anxiety feed lead path terrible thought way partner pregnant child dream like upset like turned attentive class mother
"Here's my story, however dull and blunt it may be ...  High school was great. Lots of fun You know-  Parties, beer, dates, sports and the works. I was never what one would call popular, however, I was respected by nearly everyone I went to school with. This, I feel was an asset of mine and helped me with self confidence as well as developing as a individual.  I'm now 19 (20 in June) and have no job, no money, don't go to school and have LITERALLY no friends, aside from my parents whom I still live with a leach off of (what a joke). I am virtually reclusive in my home with the occasional outing to buy cigarettes and to visit my Grandmother who is well near her deathbed.  I suppose my past bout with drugs may be a co - culprit influencing me to work in 'close to' complete isolation.  Maybe there is a cure for me but, chances are it isn't natural remedy. My addictive personality and past drug experiences has veered me away from trying the latest depression medications or any for that matter.  This condition of mine, whatever the fuck it is, started developing slowly. I would avoid large social gatherings at first, then I would pretty much steer clear of meeting with friends (even the closest of friends), and finally I wouldn't even take phone calls. At this point it's all of the above.  When I do confront a person, which by all means I try to avoid, I can't for the life of me keep eye contact like I used to and I seem like a complete, uninterested asshole who is simply in a rush and has no time for chat.  For instance, a two old friends of mine from high school stopped by at my house today to catch up on things. When asked what I was up to I looked at the ground and replied, ""Well ... I'm [pathetic excuse of a lie goes here] ...."" Nobody buys my shit. If I don't believe myself how can anyone else.?  So, here I am today. The table has turned. I am now the chump. The one without any respect OR self respect and the guy who respects anyone who isn't as lowly as myself. And I hate myself for it. It isn't as if I had a rough upbringing. My parents are and were loving, I've had so many friends, all the opportunities in the world. And I waste it all and continue to do so every stinking day of my life.  I'm not looking for sympathy. It actually matters little if nobody reads this at all.

I shouldn't expect my friends to plan their day around me last minute, even though I told them I was feeling lonely.

 Heather and I have spent the last two weekends at weddings and over 27 hours in the car. Suprisingly we did not kill each other and got along fine.  It was a little nerve racking to perform Jessica' s wedding but it was an honor to do it. I just didn't want to screw up the day she would remember forever.      Heather is doing well since she has moved here. She has already found a job that I think she will enjoy. She is going through training right now so she is not really getting to do her actual thing yet. She is working at Church's Home for Children and will be working with kids around the 8-12 age.  She will do and excellent job.   We have officially started the wedding plans. This past Sunday we went to Guest Island Ranch in Ames to see if we could have our reception or rehearsal dinner there. It was pretty interesting especially with my overdramatic dad there.   We liked it a lot and to be honest there are not a large number of options.  So we will see on how it goes. Be praying that we can plan a fun wedding but one that is reasonable and cheap. Anyway it will be good to hear how everyone is doing.

"Drank too much and ended up in the hospital Let me start this off by saying I’m underage, so that just makes this just so much better.   Anyway, a handful of months back I had the smart idea to get drunk by myself. I don’t know what did it, I only drank a few shots, less than what I normally do, but whatever I guess it was destined. Next thing I know, I’m waking up all wrapped up in IVs with my mom next to me. I’m confused as all living hell. My mom just says “you drank the vodka,” looking more devastated than I have ever seen her, and then I cry myself to sleep.  Now I’m ruined. I’m broken. The guilt eats away at me all the time, constantly. As soon as I think of my family that’s all I can think of. Apparently I was found in a aggravated state, and upon being discovered I punched two holes in the wall, along with attempting to put in a hole in my father’s head. God I fucking hate myself. I’m not even a violent person, I hate hurting anything. Being anywhere around my home or family just makes me unbearably sad now. I had to come home and look my brother in the eye, and apologize for being so fucked up I tried to not only punch my dad, but a police officer who was forced to restrain me. By the way I don’t remember any of this, all of this my parents told me. You know how much that hurts? Not remembering a night at all, and it turns out you ran at your dad screaming, “fuck you I’m gonna kill you”  I hate myself.  I’m so full of regret and guilt and self hatred all the time. I hurt my family so much, and I continue to. I’ve had multiple emotional breakdowns since, when pretending to be okay just becomes too much. I’ve made my parents so concerned for me. Not only do they constantly think I’m high now, and do not hesitate to think every single fucking broken thing is my fault because I got “too fucked up”, but with the emotional rants I’ve had I’m sure they think im about to blow any second and kill myself.   I ruined everything. My relationship with my family is ruined. I love my parents beyond belief, and I know they love me too, but the shame, and the sadness I feel just being around them, it’s constantly unbearable. Nothing feels normal anymore. It hasn’t since that fucking day. I would give anything, literally anything to go back. I’d rather be completely paralyzed than do what I did to my family.   I have no care for myself at all anymore. I hate myself more than any other person. I’m selfish, impulsive, lazy, stupid, and above all less than worthless. If I wasn’t born I’m sure my family would be much more happy.  I can’t kill myself, because then I’d kill my whole family. My mom straight up told me if I kill myself that will be the end for her too. I don’t know what to do then.

And now that she’s joining this club it’s gonna make things 1000x worse because she’s just going to show off to all the guys and be this super fake ass person? She thinks she can get away with it and basically try walk all over me just because she’s known me for ages cause otherwise she literally follows everyone else like a sheep?

Me, a guy named Matt who plays guitar, his brother who will play either bass or guitar, and Dean who will play whichever intrument Matt's brother doesn't play. Dean is awesome. He went to Juliard for four years playing bass but if you give him a flute, he would probly know how to play it. It's early and I need to go to band practice soon so I better stop writting.

Why does depression do this It's destroyed my ability to properly feel love or empathy with those closest to me.   It's driving me insane and making me feel like I don't care about them anymore. But before depression I would have laughed if you'd told me I didn't care about my family. I've always been full of love and empathy. Now I'm just angry and snappy with them. I feel like a monster.,1,doe depression destroyed ability properly feel love empathy closest me driving insane making feel like not care anymore depression laughed told did not care family love empathy just angry snappy them feel like monster

"Hi, i joined earlier last year in quite a bad state. doubt if anyone will remember me!  I kind of  sort of 'snapped out' of it if that's at all possible. I realized i wasn't just upset, but i was never diagnosed as depressed, so i'm so sorry if I'm offending anyone by posting here.   But you guys really helped me when i was last here.  From the start of this year i've been so 'down' it's unreal. At first i put it down to stress of january exams but even though the exams are over i am still so miserable (for want of a better word). I have a great boyfriend who i love very much and vice versa. we have been going out for about 6 months and everything is going great, but my moods are starting to put a strain on him (tom).  i have put it down to the fact that I am really low on self esteem at the moment for some reason, but i don't want get up in the morning because i just don't feel i can face anyone. i LOVE shopping, it makes me feel so good, but it doesn't do anything for me now. I get a bit of Seasonal Affective Disorder, and even sun showers haven't cheered me up.  Because i'm so down i've become really irritable lately, like permanent PMT and like i said, i think its really starting to put pressure on tom, because he's always on the receiving end of my moods.  I don't want to mess everything up or slip too far down the depression road again.  I just don't know what to do or how to explain things to tom (my boyfriend).  Any words of wisdom you could offer me? i think things really might be in trouble.

" Today I write on were I live, but I think I shall start with were I am from. I give you this information so that when you read my future commentaries, you will understand why I think the things I do.     I grew up in the metropolitan city of Tulsa, Oklahoma, born in 1979 and lived there until I was 18 years old. My school career consisted of living and learning with the same group of kids from Elementary~High School (give or take a few). I made many friends and lived within a social standard that rated second to none. I had everything I wanted, popularity and a social stance that should make Barbie jealous. There I was happy. After graduation I decided to move to Atlanta, Georgia (good old Hotlanta). There I lived for 2 years among my father's side of the family within a few miles of where I stayed. Atlanta was beautiful and had a lot to offer to someone seeking a professional business career, but it had it's down side too. I soon found that the night life was too enticing to ignore, and I knew I would break myself long before any good could come of the situation. With that, I moved to Michigan. As a child I would come up every summer to a small lake located between a small city and an even smaller township. I had always thought (then) that I would move to the lake and have a life of lake living and contentment upon knowing people with a higher stature and career driven lifestyles.           Now, after all that back ground I can finally tell you my stories of what I would like to call, ""As the village turns.""

"My father may have been a monster after all... I’ll try to make this as short as I can  I am a 32/F both my parents have passed my mom as recently as 12/2016. My father was up in age when I was born. My mom was wife number 5 and much younger. So when he passed in 2013 it was sad but he lived till his nineties. My parents each had two kids from previous marriages that are much older then me. My mom got sick and then was dying for a year. I was her caregiver 100% and she lived with me. I worked two jobs had no days off and was a P/T nanny as well. Which made her so happy to have in the house cause she loved babies. My bro and sister are human garbage. They did nothing for her when she was dying, made life horrible for me, disliked my care for her just all around horrible people who pushed me to the brink of suicide. I cut all ties when she died moved to another part of the state and got a promotion. I’m doing alright now and it’s only been a little over a year.   So now I had a brother from my dads marriage but he died in a car wreck in 07. My sister from my dads side is all the family I have left. I love her dearly but she has mental issues that are severe. Depression, schizophrenia, anxiety. We live in different states and I tried to get her to move to my state and she Wont she likes where she is. She lives independently and goes to a day program so she manages ok.  Recently she has been upset at my cutting ties with my half siblings her step siblings. I told her I would have no problem with her continuing contact but I would not. Hell my cunt of a shitty sister tried to borrow money from her the majority of the times she called her but still I can’t stop her she is a 50yr old woman.  But now my fragile sister is starting to not do well she is recalling abuse from when she was a teen. Gang rape at 13 multiple rapes in high school etc.  and she said our dad did nothing and noticed nothing  Now I know this could be her illness at play but....I think I believe her.  She got sick or I should say her schizophrenia came to the front lines in her early 20s after she graduated college and had a pretty damn good job. I wasn’t even born yet but my mom was in the picture.  (My mom and her were very close)  When my sister had her breakdown she described horrible rape and  abuse in the middle of delusions and episodes. My mom said my dad thought it was her sickness but as my mom put it the way she described it happening it originated somewhere. Whether delusions morphed her memories my mom thought it happened to her.  So now this sister only has me to vent to. I tried to call her case manager but as she is an adult and hasn’t been hospitalized in decades she won’t let me speak to her. I’m going to call her day program and try to speak to someone about her seeing a rape counselor or something along wit her regular treatment.  In a way I don’t want to deal with something this heavy again and I know that’s selfish I lost years of myself helping care for my dying father then 100% for my mom I was pushed to the brink of my own sanity  And then there is the fact that I think my father did do nothing. I was his favorite and I know I was. He never hit me and my mom but he was verbally abusive. But he favorited me cause I am the most like him. He valued education and ambition and I think he felt my sister failed him being sick along with my brother. He acted as a father and I have good memories of him but he wasn’t exactly a emotional or loving person to my mom or at times me. But I guess I got the little he had in him.   Now I’m starting to wonder if he was a sociopath or fuck a damn monster.   After my brother who would be said sisters full brother died in what we thought was a regular car accident I found out it wasn’t. He was on pills and had an addiction and was telling people  this shit will kill me. And from the police report witnesses state he just veered into a pole never hit anyone or anything. Just went into a tree.  My fathers first two children ended up like they did and then there is is me. Without my mom would I have been something different?   While I pulled myself out of the hole I thought I was in, I haven’t done well in dating or making friends in my new city. before my parents illnesses I was good at it.  I’m afraid I’m doing ok with all these losses because I am like him.   Through my job I’m booking sessions with a therapist but im still scared to pick up the phone when my sister calls  I know I sound really selfish  ",0,father monster all try make short f parent passed mom recently father age born mom wife number younger passed sad lived till ninety parent kid previous marriage older me mom got sick dying year caregiver lived me worked job day pt nanny well happy house cause loved baby bro sister human garbage did dying life horrible me disliked care just horrible people pushed brink suicide cut tie died moved state got promotion doing alright little year brother dad marriage died car wreck sister dad family left love dearly mental issue severe depression schizophrenia anxiety live different state tried state wont like is life independently go day program manages ok recently upset cutting tie half sibling step sibling told problem continuing contact not hell cunt shitty sister tried borrow money majority time called stop yr old woman fragile sister starting not recalling abuse teen gang rape multiple rape high school etc said dad did noticed know illness play buti think believe her got sick say schizophrenia came line early s graduated college pretty damn good job not born mom picture my mom close sister breakdown described horrible rape abuse middle delusion episode mom said dad thought sickness mom way described happening originated somewhere delusion morphed memory mom thought happened her sister vent to tried case manager adult not hospitalized decade not let speak her going day program try speak seeing rape counselor wit regular treatment way not want deal heavy know selfish lost year helping care dying father mom pushed brink sanity fact think father did nothing favorite know wa hit mom verbally abusive favorited cause like him valued education ambition think felt sister failed sick brother acted father good memory not exactly emotional loving person mom time me guess got little him starting wonder sociopath fuck damn monster brother said sister brother died thought regular car accident not pill addiction telling people shit kill me police report witness state just veered pole hit anything just went tree father child ended like did me mom different pulled hole thought in not dating making friend new city parent illness good it afraid doing ok loss like him job booking session therapist im scared pick phone sister call know sound really selfish
"Sad all the time and abusing many drugs to try n stay alive Hi, I've had depression n anxiety for a few years now, had ups n downs but mainly downs, it's got to the point where I use weed, md, xans, ket n alcohol to fill up the holes.  I honestly wouldn't be alive without the drugs pulling me through, I've even started using my prescription pregabalin (lyrica) to get a buzz too ( taking enough to get high)  I barely talk about my feelings I feel so isolated from my friends and the mask is slipping, i want it to slip in a way so they see the real me.  I've been trying to open up more but it's so fucking hard to do that, I've got to the point where I don't care, don't care about my life or feelings I don't care how I die, I don't care how long it takes I don't care what method , hanging , OD, drowning, train, fire  it doesn't bother me.  I don't want to be me anymore I don't want my life, I know that life is shit and throws stuff at you but I can't handle it, my anxiety is so bad I don't open the front door or answer phone calls even if it's my friend.  Myself and my mental illnesses have put me in a deep hole and I can't get out by myself, the thing is it's not just me I have many mental health professionals helping me but the thing is I've got used to keeping the mask on, white lies, they don't know the full extent of my problems.

" Hey, life. I am kinda sceptical about this whole talking to myself on the internet thing, it just doesn't seem like something I would do...But hell, I have one life, so I might as well try everything once. Just so anyone who views this knows, I am a 17 year old junior in High School, I play football, basketball, track, and golf (I am a starter on all teams), and I love hanging out and hooking up (what's new, right?). Any-hoo, today was a pretty weird day. It started like a usual day, getting a ride with my mom to school cuz my licsense is legally suspended. Going to first period was nothing new, but it was what happened afterwards that really kinda upset me. For about the past two weeks, I have been helping out a friend (who is a girl, just for clarification), get a guy that she really liked. Well she finally got him, and I like to think it was me that got her the guy. She was scared, and I gave her confidence in making the first move. She didn't want to hurt friends, so I went and told the friends just how the girl felt so that they wouldn't get in a fight over him. She asked me every night what to talk about and every night she told me just how much she liked him. Getting back to the point, she walked up and told me she finally asked him out and he said yes. The part that really hit me was that it was then that I realized, How can I get her a boyfriend, yet I can't even tell the girl that I like that I like her???I pretty much got those two people going out, and yet I can't get a girlfriend, I can't tell the girl I like that I like her, and I can't even manage my own life, but yet I helped my friend get her life in better shape. How is that????If you have an answer or an opinion, post back please.

"Has your family always ignored your problem? I think the hardest part of being depressed since I was a kid is how absolutely ignored I was/am by my family. My parents split up when I was 5 and my father died when I was 10. My family completely sweeped it under the rug like I was supposed to be completely ok with it and it has never been a topic of discussion at home. I walked around sad, slumbered over, quiet, avoided eye contact and stared into the distance for years and years and no one ever assumed proper to ask if there is something wrong with me. The only time they sent a psychologist my way was when they had to determine who I should live with after divorce. My mother to this day seems absolutely oblivious to my suffering.  I don't ever feel like telling them for they will propably assume I'm ungrateful and spoilt. I've had everything! They sent me to school, fed me, put clothes on my back. What else could I possibly need?  I don't want to burden or blame anyone for what has happened but just I feel so abandoned.",1,family ignored problem think hardest depressed kid absolutely ignored wasam family parent split father died family completely sweeped rug like supposed completely ok topic discussion home walked sad slumbered over quiet avoided eye contact stared distance year year assumed proper ask wrong me time sent psychologist way determine live divorce mother day absolutely oblivious suffering not feel like telling propably assume ungrateful spoilt everything sent school fed me clothes back possibly need not want burden blame happened just feel abandoned
"Constant battle between ambition and not wanting to live. Since I was about 12 I've had recurring suicidal thoughts. The thing is, I don't have low self esteem or anything of that sort, it's actually quite the opposite and I always joke about being a narcissist. I may not be an actual narcissist, but I've always had a slight superiority complex.  I don't hate myself, but I just hate my life and the continuous chore known as living. On the outside, I've always been the life of the party, but deep down I don't ever remember being happy. As someone who's highly ambitious, it feels as if there's a never ending struggle between wanting to be successful enough to be well known or have an impact on the world, and wanting to stop existing. Yet with the prospect of the latter, comes the failure of the former. I know that if I lowered my expectations in life I would be mildly happier, yet the thought of settling for mediocrity gives me horrible anxiety and fills me with dread.   Recently things have gotten worse due to my university workload. I've been having trouble completing assignment and functioning in general. I've considered getting help but I feel deeply uncomfortable at the thought of opening up to someone, since I'm not a very emotional person. I've come to accept that I will probably never be happy. I've always wondered if I would be more likely to actually commit suicide if I ever attained the level of success I desire since I would have then achieved my goal in life, or if that would finally bring me the contentment I seek. I suppose it would be the former since I can never be content.

"I know I'm overreacting but I need to vent So there is this girl I've been friends with for three years. Right now she is almost done with college but I still have to take some courses so we don't see each other that often. That's why she told me two weeks ago we should meet up.

Turns out my mum needed money so I have almost nothing on me and because of that I told her I could hang out but couldn't go to the restaurant she said we should try. She replied that she ""couldn't make it tomorrow"" (today) and I thought wth?! you said Monday? It was you the one who said Monday not me... Anyway she said let's meet up on Wednesday and I said ok but tbh I don't feel like going out whatsoever. She was sorry because, and I quote, ""I thought we were going to meet today"" and I'm like dafuq. She, all of a sudden, forgot about it?! Does it make any sense? I guess she made plans with other people or whatever but fuck it, don't say one thing and then act like you didn't even say anything. I know I'm overreacting here but I'm so fucking tired of people and their ""you're my best friend"" and ""I love you, I care about you"" shit.

"Hello, I think this is where I introduce myself...I'm 34 I've been suffering severely with depression since I was 6.

Maybe there's someone out there who has a sensitivity to these medicines too ... who can help? so far some take off the edge, but I always end up breaking down and EXPLODING.

"My Fictional Home    I stared outside, and watched the cold atmosphere awake me. The sun’s rays blocked by the magnificent beauty above us all; an urban scape filling my view around me. I felt a grave sadness strike all in the same spots for my daily routine, crippling what was left of my head. I grabbed the bicycle, and went along the path to any good in my life.     ‘A nearly missed accident up ahead,’ I reminded myself. I hit the button to change colors, and awaited a stop that could mean a sour tardiness or a decent morning. The color changed fast, and I hastily sped across the lines between me and the other side. I arrived, striking the pavement at full speed ahead down the rubber sidewalk.     A straight path to follow, a new future to envelop soon enough. The fact of the matter was that I had to pray to a god I didn’t believe in if I wanted to warp my happy spirit to glorious utopia. Logic overrides hearts quite rarely, leaving a snowflake and a shock of noise behind the mind that just wants it all to change. My bored mind only somewhat consciously bobbed his head around from side to side, keeping an eye on the reflective sign for a change of heart.     The observant man coming by on a bicycle or on his own two legs could notice the hurting expression that shone on my face. An insomnia that has outlasted its course, half a heart to spare to the one it belongs to, and the tonnes lying on his stubby shoulders. Whether the man is out to care for their dog, the mail, something; they always take a look to glance at the face of a broken child, often not realizing the fine details in the street lights glowing on my frozen cheeks.     ‘What did it take to find redemption?’ I often wondered, as grand sunlight was walking upstairs to knock the moon off it’s sleepy stool. I sat and watched a beautiful red giant approach, and drew images in mind to flicker about and echo in my concave dome of secrets. As the flickering opportunity ran full speed in front of me, I turned and felt the imagery toss into the incinerator. A great insecurity washed over the industry working ahead up above, slowing me down as I walked in slowly toward the place to call work.     I sat the bicycle at it’s rack, hands in pocket as I blinked at the glaring sun. A numbness hit my heart, and for the next eight hours, I’d lose who I was, only coming back at the rise of a pounding rain. I walked from a distant building, taking the long path to a home that didn’t know me. I took the rugged bicycle, and stared up above at the shadowy clouds.     I leaned forward over the handlebars, watching the patterns fly past my visions. I lifted up again, opening my voice to play a tune, looking for a face to redeem my little work. I went onward, and stared at the home that forgot me. I walked slowly up, placing the bicycle just where it was, hitting the kickstand which had sacrificed my ankle some.     I opened the door, giving a brief greeting. I entered the meeting room of regrets and lost innocence, stroking my hands over what was a cuddly friend. My vision blurred, feeling the great exhaustion from the night prior taking me over. I curled in the corner, feeling the toilets flushing the pent up pains from an earlier disembarkment of a peanut gallery. I hugged the one thing that brought a soothing to my life, and proceeded to let out an ugly sob, trying to remember who everyone was, as I grabbed a broken mirror, staring at who the blurry stranger was in it.     I felt myself faint, awaking to two strangers cycling the door between storage and the hands of all waiting for me. “What were you thinking?” the woman asked, “What did you say?” the man asking. “I don’t know.” I responded, lying on my side, as they both awkwardly stepped out, with a cracked expression of what was me walking out. I felt a blankness ride across my body, as I stared upon a wall that reminded me of life.     I sat stationary, and buried my head under a recording of a person with nothing left. I held my heart, staring out at the dark that I wanted to escape in. A length that no person dared, but a low that felt necessary. I felt an unnecessary realism flow through me, as my arms folded, feeling a coldness drip down my neck.     I got up, and went to the porch of attempting life again. A moon vanished above me, showing a pine away from me only just by some measurements. The bicycle appeared broken on the road, as I walked to what I remember being the last resort in this world. I walked to a reused bench, and stared out at the murky waters that felt like memories. I looked to my left, seeing a young boy sitting in the back of a delinquent’s wagon, and to my right a child amongst a smaller group, enjoying the finer delicacies of life. In between it all, a fool.     I cracked my bubbly back, as a soreness hit my veins. I stood slowly, my body tossing and turning inside. The world turned askew, as the sun beat slowly onto my flustered body. I took flight across the ramp of a broken dream, taking a flip that would ruin me for a day. A nostalgia for the life that was simple broke me down slowly, as I felt my walking slow down. I sat by a curb, watching a teenager go away from a regretful sunset on a bench. He sported a terrible frown, forgetting of the one. A light flew by at fast speeds, turning away from my stretched out legs, as a noise emitted from it’s front.     I stared blankly into the street, feeling my mind shatter into many jagged pieces. A dam blocked the feeling of humanity and a progress of going up in the world. I picked up the pieces, attaching them to my hurting consciousness. I stomped back to a filthy bed, staring into the bright light that fueled no purpose. I spread a message, the bait missing all parties.     I collapsed, waking to a time of no reply. I logged into what made time fly by, and felt the pains of months wash away within seconds. A second half had joined, and I forgot about all the things around me for the next year. Dawn upon myself shined my sleepy public works to let out a shrieking cry, standing over a bin full of scraps and desperation to fix my bleeding innards. I panicked into a corner, awaiting life’s worst terrors. I stood to nothing, and returned to a hamper of depression. I stared at the dusty fan blades fly full speed, breathing in only to glance at the horrid truth.     A shadow stood behind my forgotten figure, taunting the fullness above it. I wore a jacket and yelled at it, and it shyly walked. I took a deep breath and walked outside toward the bench once again, staring out at the beautiful waters. A creature came from the waters, approaching me. I held its hand, standing up accordingly. The creature pushed me into a pit full of spikes, as I awoke to half of me missing. I felt a burning inside of me, as my insides waned into a fine drawing of genitalia, washing the deliberate feeling and thought around my head, causing me to let out of a horrific screech of losing a natural ability.     My body awoke in a new person’s home, as I stared out into the busy road below my sleepy figure. An old woman came out from the corner, as I nervously responded with a gulp. We shared an exchange, as I sat and pondered the shelves of a life that I knew little about. I explored the past, only finding multiple recordings of enthusiasts. I folded my hands, recognizing that I meant nothing here.     The plane flew slowly away, as the shock went away from my skull, as my heart was left with a small hole. I sat and could not breathe, only feeling a great pain as we jumped into the chair of obnoxious actions. I sat and thought, glancing at the broken mirror.

"One of the biggest things i'm struggling with (besides my depression duh) is finding a good therapist. I moved about 6 months ago, and I have not had luck finding a therapist that I can work well with. I know that I need help with cognitive therapy, and i've gone to a couple therapists who have cognitive listed as a specialty, but when I get into therapy with them, its all talk therapy with little to no help to me. Don't get me wrong, talking does help, but I know from my years of dealing with this illness that I need some good solid cognitive therapy to help me to overcome my lack of self n worth / self n esteem / confidence.

Help me figure this out So I’m a single mom I left my boyfriend because of us arguing all the time. He has my son two days out of the week and for his birthday I gave him three to be nice (there’s a reason I don’t want him having more bc he can not handle stress) but when he dropped my son off he told me he now wants him for a week meaning I have my son one week and he gets the other but I don’t want that because I think it would be too stressful for my 10 month old so I told him I’ll take him to court which the father does not want . Things have smoothed over but I still want to go to court so this arguing over days will stop but I do not want to fuck myself over due to not having a job . I live with my mom and have a stable household but having him 5 days out of the week it’d be hard for me to get a job that will work with me . If we go to court I’d allow him three days that way I can get a decent amount of work time but if I go to court without having a job or a car would that fuck me over and give the father more time ?

"I'm tired of forcing myself to do things. Maybe it's me being lazy. Maybe it's my undiagnosed ADHD.  I don't know.   All I know is that I hate not being able to enjoy almost *anything*.   I just feel so numb and dull. I dropped almost all of my friendships with people who are not in my workplace. Haven't had the motivation to talk to anyone. It just feels like a chore to me. Socializing is torturous and I get bored very quick. I can't seem to focus on any conversation.   I hate forcing myself to do the most simple things, like: taking a shower, putting on makeup, cooking, cleaning, even playing videogames. I'm a huge WoW nerd, so I should be excited for the new patch and game. But, I'm not. I got amped up when I saw the trailer, but now, I rather not play it. I rather not play anything. Just recently, I forced myself to play Bioshock again. It's been years since I visited Rapture. I *love* Rapture. But why is it so boring to play? I used to have so much fun...  How do you get out of this funk? I don't want to feel like this and it is ruining my life. Not to mention, my SO and I haven't been doing well because of it. I just feel...nothing. I need help, but I don't want a therapist or any new diet plans. None of that copypaste bullshit. What *actually* works?   Also, I forgot to mention that I smoke weed daily. I heard that it can make depression worse and I've been using it for almost two years now. Is this something I should only do at night? I originally used it for sleep.

"Is my dad enabling my mom? I have posted on multiple subs about my turbulent relationship with my mom, and I feel like I am afraid of her. I've gotten to a point where I jump when the garage door opens and she comes home from work. I think have become so irrationally afraid of my mom, that fear manifested today when I was going to pick my brother up from work and saw my mom coming the other way. I freaked out and ended up rear-ending another car, totaling mine (I am not hurt, don't worry.) Needless to say, this whole situation has caused chaos in my house and I am terrified to ever get behind the wheel again.  Tonight my dad called me out on me calling my mom ""abusive"" a few weeks ago. Bear in mind, neither she nor my dad has ever laid a finger on me, but my mom has emotionally abusive tendencies. She has said things to me that have fucked me up more than she can understand.  Here's a short list of some things she's done:  * If guilt tripping were an Olympic sport, let's just say she'd be Michael Phelps. * She likes to ask me what's wrong when I'm upset and when I tell her, she cuts me off and says ""I don't want to talk about it."" * She has criticized my weight for as long as I can remember. In her defense, her two sisters are 500 pounds apiece will both probably die before they reach 60, so she just wants me to be healthy and live long. But she's not helping. She's only making me want to cry into a Chipotle bowl. * She liked comparing me to my best friend in high school (""Why can't you be more like her? She studies and gets good grades!"") Still does sometimes. * To this day, she pesters me about my lack of religion. I remember when I was 11 and didn't want to go to Sunday School, she was like ""Do you want to be a heathen and go to hell?"" A couple years ago, she told me ""I just want you to go to Heaven when you die."" She even pestered me a week ago about having demons in my head. * I thought I could confide in her about my sexuality but she quickly shot me down with ""How do you know? You've never been on a date before. That doesn't mean you're bi/gay!"" She also told me I am asexual and she's pretty much gaslighted me about my sexuality to the point where I don't know whether I am gay or straight anymore. * I was diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD when I was a kid and she's basically used that diagnosis to keep me in a little bubble. I didn't get drivers' license until 18, didn't get my first job until 20, and I'm still perpetually single... all because my mom has used my diagnoses as a crutch. She still does, and after the accident, I don't fucking blame her!  Whenever I try to tell him about the things my mom says, he says things like ""What's wrong with motivating you to get better grades?"" or ""Your mom doesn't want you to end up like your sisters that she is going to bury because they're 500 pounds."" My mom is my bully, and he is her apologist.  I don't how much of this (if anything) constitutes abuse, but my dad doesn't buy any of it and blames it on ""liberal millennial indoctrinated safe-space snowflake bullshit... abuse is broken bones, black eyes and cigarette burns on arms."" He goes on about how he and mom have done everything for me and how there is something in my sick, twisted mind that is confusing ""constructive criticism"" with ""abuse.""  Deep down, I am beginning to resent my parents, because they *have* done everything for me, sheltered me and spoiled me to the point where I don't know how the world outside my little bubble works. I am 23 now and don't feel any better off now than I did when I was ten years ago. There are certain life skills I don't have because they did everything for me. I don't feel like I've ever had to work for anything and I hate them for it. They tried to be tougher with me but didn't have the spine. They never forced me to do anything except go to summer camps for special needs kids, they pretty much just let me raise myself and it's costing all of us dearly. Tonight is the night my real life begins.  Basically, if I am so afraid of my mom that seeing her on the road freaks me out to the point of an accident, something in our relationship has gone south. I don't know if it's her or me anymore.",0,dad enabling mom posted multiple sub turbulent relationship mom feel like afraid her gotten point jump garage door open come home work think irrationally afraid mom fear manifested today going pick brother work saw mom coming way freaked ended rearending car totaling i not hurt not worry needle say situation caused chaos house terrified wheel again tonight dad called calling mom abusive week ago bear mind dad laid finger me mom emotionally abusive tendency said thing fucked understand short list thing done guilt tripping olympic sport let just say michael phelps like ask wrong upset tell her cut say i not want talk it criticized weight long remember defense sister pound apiece probably die reach just want healthy live long not helping making want chipotle bowl liked comparing best friend high school why like her study get good grade doe sometimes day pesters lack religion remember did not want sunday school like do want heathen hell couple year ago told i just want heaven die pestered week ago having demon head thought confide sexuality quickly shot how know date before doe not mean bigay told asexual pretty gaslighted sexuality point not know gay straight anymore diagnosed aspergers adhd kid basically used diagnosis little bubble did not driver license did not job perpetually single mom used diagnosis crutch doe accident not fucking blame her try tell thing mom say say thing like what wrong motivating better grade your mom doe not want end like sister going bury pound mom bully apologist not if anything constitutes abuse dad doe not buy blame liberal millennial indoctrinated safespace snowflake bullshit abuse broken bone black eye cigarette burn arm go mom sick twisted mind confusing constructive criticism abuse deep down beginning resent parent have me sheltered spoiled point not know world outside little bubble work not feel better did year ago certain life skill not did me not feel like work hate it tried tougher did not spine forced summer camp special need kid pretty just let raise costing dearly tonight night real life begin basically afraid mom seeing road freak point accident relationship gone south not know anymore

" It has been crazy getting here, as I started this journey on 24th April. I have just started working again last week. I set off late on Saturday with my pick-up truck and a U-Haul trailer full of all my stuff and made it to Arizona (2415 miles) in 3 days. The truck then promptly broke down 70 miles away from my cousin’s house! What are the chances of driving that far and then it packing up on her doorstep?   After 2 weeks the mechanics at the garage managed to figure out the computer had gone on the truck and that is why it had stopped which would have been great if it had not been the air sensor that was the problem. Although I did get to do some of the best mountain biking of my life in a place call Sedona, AZ so who cares?!   With the truck still out of action, I was forced to ride to California on my Triumph 955i motorcycle, through some of the best desert roads on the planet - life is hard sometimes! When I got to California, Scott a friend of mine put me up in his house in Orange County, which was very cool of him as I stayed there for 3 weeks and he never once complained about the smell. I had a copious amount of job interviews during this time and was offered a number of them, but in the end I have gone back to working for Rentokil-Initial for the third time!   Therefore, with a few weeks to kill before I was due to start working again, I went off for a ride on the Triumph up through the mountains of California to Lake Tahoe. Tahoe is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen and well worth a visit if you are ever out this way. I then rode back down through the deserts of Nevada past Area 51 and Death Valley to Las Vegas and back to my cousin’s house in Arizona. It was good to relax, do some camping, laugh and point at fat Americans and take some time out.    So I am now back to working in the Tropical Plants Division, selling plant services (selling flowers in San Francisco may sound a little gay to you and to be far it is!!).   I am happy out here in San Jose, it is incredible. It has a wonderful climate, is close to the sea and mountains, San Francisco is also really close and Lake Tahoe is only 3 hours away for some great snowboarding!! I am so happy to be out of New York!  Thanks for visiting my blogger!

" In the year 2002, was my greatest regret ever. The only peson invoved and to be blamed is me. It was my fault that I did not I did not do well in my P.S.L.E. I was studying in Coral Primary school. There is where my problems started.      Firstly, I mixed around in the wrong group. I was new in Coral Primary as I had just transfered from Loyang Primary in the second month of 2000. In the beginning I thought it would be ""ok"", and the things I did were fun and I enjoyed it very much. I skipped the remedials I had every day to meet my friends in the car park. There I would spend hours to play with fire but I did not smoke. I did not pick up any bad habbits as I already knew they were to harm me. And when I went home I would tell my mum that i went for my remedials. I thought I would concentrate in my work as well as well as go out with my friends. But this did not happen. Instead I started avoiding studies. Soon, I started getting involved in more trouble and later on I started thinking that my friends were more important than my studies. When the time came, that was two years later in the year 2002, I wasen't ready. It was my P.S.L.E. It was now that I realised that my mistakes.        During my exams I went blank in my weakest subject, maths. The rest of the subjects were average. I started to panic as I knew I was going to get bad marks. In the end I did. I did very badly and got into a school I did not wnted, Siglap Secondary. At first I thought that I would do anything to get out, but as time passed, I became to know the school beter and realised it was a good place to learn in. But every where there will be ""this"" and ""thats"". There is no scholl that is perfect. Well, I was confused in what to do, I was lost but I knew that I had to adapt to it and strive to do my best. I was angry and dissapointed at myself on my mistake but I knew I had to let the past be the past. But not forget the past but learn from the mistakes. I learnt my mistakes and I know that I should not do it again. Now I have stuck this in my head that I should not mix around in the wrong company as the consequences would be unbearable and that I should pay attension in my studies. Now that I know the ""good"" and the ""bad"" and now I believe I can achieve my goal.

" Ok, so this is my new blog. Hmmm. I think this looks better over here don't you? Yes, that's nicer. Ok then.   I'd like you to go and visit my website which resides at:  urlLink Bunni's Place    It's not quite finished, because my significant other hasn't finished providing me with his significant content for his part of the site. But the rest is done, or at least done enough that it might be considered enjoyable rather than annoying. Then again some people are annoyed by almost everything enjoyable. One can't make everyone happy.   I decided that a Blog might be a nice addition as I need a place to whine without having to upload a new whiners page to my site. Not that I will always whine here, but since I have the opportunity, I suppose I could. I could also leave the page absolutely blank, and make people wonder what I was up to. Well maybe just my paranoid visitors. Most people probably wouldn't care.   There's that word probably. Chances are, you will not see that word typed on a page of mine often. Since my earliest bbs days I have cut that word down to prolly, and it's become part of my speech. I avoid saying LOL during a conversation however. I actually do laugh out loud.

"Close friend becoming distant.... So I’ve (f,21) had a friend (m,21) that I’ve known for over two years, and we typically text or snap daily. There are times where we are texting or snapping straight for a couple of hours or we get busy with other stuff so we reply when we have a chance. Two weeks ago we had been hanging out at his place and everything to me seemed normal. Then out of the blue this week I feel as though he’s become extremely distant. He stopped basically replying to me at all. It’s been a couple of days in a row that he only responds a couple of times in the morning and then is gone during the entire day. Since I’ve known him, he has never been this way. (I'm sure some might say he's in a relationship, but he's currently single. Plus when he was in a relationship, he didn't act this way.)  So last week I had sent him something early in the day and he didn’t reply until the following day. I didn’t think much of it because the next couple of days we were chatting like nothing and I was sure he was completely busy. Keep in mind, this was a couple days before he basically went blank on me. It actually got me thinking of what I had said that first day and think why he’d be so mad possibly to respond. The day that it had all started I had told him I had applied to a place and had gotten a interview the following day. I told him this even though he’s told me he’s been applying to different places and hasn’t gotten a single interview. When I told him I didn’t think that it would affect him that much since he’s told me he’d never apply to the place I’m gonna start working at. (Like he straight up told me he’d rather die than work at that place.) However, he's not the type to be petty or take things like that extremely hard and to heart.  I’m not sure how I should think about all of this.I have anxiety (which is why I’m stressing) but I’m telling myself he may be going through something and I don’t want to just push him. We’ve gotten extremely close enough to the point where we’ve discussed things that are vulnerable things. He's dealt with major stuff and so have I, so I also find it weird that he wouldn’t talk to me about any of it (if it was something personal).  Should I continue waiting basically a day for a response, or let it ride out and see if he gets back to himself and talks? Do you think he’s trying to ghost me? Or should I ask him what’s happening? (And if I do what should I say so that I’m not exactly targeting him). He has depression and we have discussed serious matters so I don't want to make him feel bad.  Feel free to ask any questions.

"Reddit, need your help on restoring friendship Hello there, dear redditors. I truly need your advice and every opinion is highly appreciated, so feel free to express whatever's on your mind. I'll try to keep things as short as possible, so here's the problem. I know a friend of mine since we were 7 and now i'm 23. Recently (for a month or two) i started allowing new people in my life, which is pretty unusual for me and it got so overwhelming and intense that i didn't notice i started building distance with my best friend because i concentrated on new people too much. Eventually we got so far from each other that we barely even talk. We still respect each other and are chatting on occasion trying to look like we're still those ""good old friends"", but i can tell that he's not okay with the situation, even despite he's trying not to show me that. I know i fucked up big time. He's my best friend that has always been there for me and i won't forgive myself if i'll lose him. So, reddit, what do i do? I know it would be the best just to tell about the situation, but i can't find proper words and it pains me.

"Hello, I'm new here. I'm 36 and have had depression since the age of 9. I'm supposed to take Lexapro every day, but often I forget. Memory / concentration is poor, one of the areas of the brain that depression screws with, the others being sleep, appetite, and libido.  Here's my thing ... I'm so gosh darn afraid to do anything! It's hard at times to even face my job, I call in sick and stay in pajamas all day. I do get out of bed, but I won't bathe or brush teeth. Isn't that gross! I did this on Monday and Tuesday this week.  I'm in school at night, it's a tele course class in geology. Last Friday we had an exam, and I didn't show up for it because I didn't do any reading for it. Now it's almost Wednesday, and I still haven't touched the reading. We can make up the exam no later than 1 week after the exam date, so I have two days to cover several chapters. Thing is, I'm SCARED CRAPLESS to even start!!! It's like I've got ""freeze - itis"" and I can't seem to study! I've been doing other things, like cleaning and laundry and doing Immigration research (trying to bring my Egyptian fiance here to the States), but haven't touched the geology, even though that's been #1 on my mind for two weeks. Even this past weekend, I had no plans (as usual!) and didn't crack open even one page.  I fear failure, and it's so hard to ""let go and let God"". I know in my head to give this fear to God, but I don't really know what that specifically means. In the meantime, I'm miserable and failing my geology class. Already I dropped the music class (originally I had two), since I was failing that royally.  Can anyone relate? How do any of you summon up the courage to face your fears?

" The day started like any normal day. Spent quality time with cow shit in the morning and then came home. But when I came home, I had the pleasure of trying to inform the soccer team of our game in De Pere that evening. That was an adventure. Called 10 people, left messages by all but 3. We ended up cancelling it anyway, thank God. So instead I went in my yard and kicked a ball around for a while just to pass the time because the Brewers are in the midst of a horrendous offense stretch. I actually caught Adult Swim tonight. Family Guy, Futurama, and Aqua Teen Hunger Force were all of good quality. So until something interesting happens, everyone who reads this will be forced to be as bored as me.

" I'm not complete idiot. I'm not the person you think I am. I'm not putting my name for my saftey, for the fear of being ridiculed by my peers. This is a record of my life and this is how I intend to keep it.  I was never the most popular boy in school. I couldn't do magic nor could I hold a wand right. Brooms I could never control, and potions I never could suceed. I was not very smart, until I had a inspiration. Ronald Weasley, thats who. He was nothing then, but I knew that he was to be the future Samurai. I studied harder than ever, and was ridiculed by my brothers more than ever before, and I dared not to tell them my plans. My brothers spited me, or should I say my half brothers. I had in all, 2 brothers, all older. Kenji and Kenshin were at large, and the two Samurais, not to mention. I am just a mage, a fire mage. Fire mages were not fun to be because they have bright firey colored hair. This, I have, But the hot temper I do not have. Project 1242 (AKA The Weasley Project) would raise my success rate more than ever.  I soon studied very hard, but the years passed and soon it was too late to pull my plan off. So, I spent days of thinking and finally figured out what to do. I would aim my sights at the next decendant. His name was Riley Cook, and he was not born yet, so I had more time than ever. I studied hard and got stronger. You may not yet know my plans but here they are: I will become Riley's master so he will gain respect for the lost brother of the Samurais. This was my plan, well, the base of it. In my mind (and in millions of folders and disks) I went through the plan over and over again. It was completely full proof by the time Riley was born, but yet I kept gaining more and more knowledge of things around me and got stronger and stronger, but I did not change the way I looked, I did not want to scare the kid like I know Kenshin and Kenji would do.  I must stop writing now because my Ri is waking from a nightmare and I feel the need to comfort him.

"It’s not some fucking sadness anymore. This is madness. I remember when I just had a few days when I felt sad and out of it. And I would worry but then everything became better a few days later. Still, I went to a psychologist, because my downs were too consistent to be considered normal.  It all went downhill from there. I feel like I’ve lost a part of myself. My personality, my identity, whatever. I feel like when I talk to others I’m not “there”, like I’ve lost control of what I say and think. Like I’ve lost my mind. Like others are normal and I’m in my own world, going through life on automatic mode, not knowing what I should think, say, or do. Even though from outside people might say I’m completely normal, even sometimes better than before, I feel like mentally, inside, the world is going down. My life is crumbling. Like piece by piece I get further away from a solution. Things that seem to work for others don’t work for me.   I hate it. It’s not just a “bad mood” anymore. It’s feeling like I’ve lost my way, and there’s no signs to get back. Like a loop I can’t get out of. That’s why suicide comes up as an option. When you’re stuck in a loop, the only solution is to shut off. If sleeping is the only thing I enjoy, then why won’t I sleep forever?

" Yesterday while shooping for my husband, i am usually very nice and polite and try to use as much German as possible. But I always don't have the write words or i just don't know the language that well to come up with a solution to my conversation. Anyway I went to this store here called,""Budnikowsky"". It is smaller to our Rite Aides or Drug stores in the States. The only difference is they don't carry drugs. On the Apotheke pharmacys carry any such over the counter remedy's. My daughter had dropped her binki or pacifier while we were walking and so i had to get a replacement for her and the best to go for that was Budni. Kowing that they carried such items. After getting my stroller in the store and wading threw all the people i had found what i was looking for. I then heading for the line to check out. Since the store is crowed most of the time,even on Mondays, I had to push my way to get in line or other people would just get in front of you again with the no personal boudries issue. If you leave room for another person someone will think that it is meant for them and just cut in front of you no second thought. Well as i approached the counter of this young cashier, she of course never sported a smile to customers but instead basically looked up briefly and gave the look of NEXT! My turn! I said Hi! and she said Guten Tag, meaning Hello back. My total was 1,98 euros. I gave her 2. She then in turn was asking if i had any change but because I dont speak the language i didnt understand what she was saying to me. What kinda of change would she need for 1,98? Two was good enough. All she had to do was give me back two cents. But because i didnt understand what she was saying i did understand her body language which ended up in a huff and a puff from her. Like she was telling me you stupid idiot dont you understand and if you dont you dont belong in my line. Well of course after that gester and after dealing with my sick daughter all day shopping i had all I could take of the day and promptly recieved my change and replied to her, ""You know yo can eat shit!!"". From the look on her face i can tell she understood everything i said even in english. After that i felt great for the rest of the day. I find if you are nice to these workers they run all over you until you are nasty like them back and then they are your best friend.  Viki C.

"Friend is badgering me to give them stuff, and frankly it's making me feel less inclined to reciprocate. So. I'm going to use fake names for these people instead of referring to them as mere pronouns.   Me = The CrazyCOKids  Orlando = The guy who is badgering me because, well, Orlando *is* the name of a character in Redwall who is a badger.   Grath = Second person  Fallow = Someone else, mutual friend of all of ours.    So. Grath and I decide to do something together just the two of us. However, Orlando is a bit... *jealous*. Like, all the time someone else I'll refer to as Fallow wants to do something with me or Grath.   Orlando seems to have this... massive victim complex. This isn't entirely unjustified mind you^ , but the problem is, he tends to extend this to friends. If say, Grath or Fallow decide to do something together, Orlando assumes he is being excluded on purpose and maliciously.   See, we basically want to be friends with each other, rather than being ""by association"". (ever hang out with a group of people, yet you realise the only reason you know some of them is because another person brings 'em along? yeah.) We basically don't wanna just be ""Orlando's friend"" or ""Grath's buddy"", or ""Crazy's friend"" to each other. So we're intentionally doing some things with each other.   Orlando, however, wants to be included in *everything*, and thinks that if people are doing something without him, he's being excluded intentionally and maliciously. So at first we didn't mention what we were doing, because Orlando would come in private and ask ""You going to do me next?"" or start going all ""Oh nobody ever thinks to include me I'm always the one left out"" or starts trying to guilt-trip us. But then, well, that obviously made him think that we were hiding stuff from him. Whenever we went to him first (and boy do we ever) he doesn't complain, and frankly it seems like we really shouldn't have to run everything through him because we're not in grade school still and you know, oftentimes if we *do* run it past him and ask if he would like to get involved he complains that he feels like 'the third wheel' or 'like we're just including him to be nice'. :/   Then he decides to start harassing us asking if we'll include him in things, essentially demanding we do things to him to make it up, then doing things like ""I just want to be included so then I can at least enjoy this thing"". So he guilt-trips us with how bad his (admittedly shitty) homelife is to try and get us to do things one-on-one with him or give him gifts.   Enough is enough. Simply put we wanna put our feet down - again. Except! I know what'll happen.  Orlando will take it as an act of aggression and with malicious intent. Grath will start complaining at Orlando for (admittedly) being immature about the whole thing. He'll start acting like we're ganging up on him, even though we're trying to tell him that when he asks for stuff in private the way he is, that we're only doing it just to shut him up. i've tried telling him to try organising things himself for a change so he's not always going ""Hey! Wait for me!"" but he doesn't seem to get it.

" Okay... so maybe this thing is the new livejournal bandwagon. Who knows. Don't really care at this point. I'm far too lazy to maintain my own blog atm, so this is going to work just fine for me.   I find myself wondering why I persist in this constant struggle with my shape. It seems like no matter how much I cut back or how much I exercise, I don't change all that much. I'm supposed to hit the Dr in 2 weeks to have her tell me I'm too fat. Thrilling, eh?   Also we have shifting managerial garbage over at work, and that has me stressed out. I  want  assistant manager really badly. I don't know if it'll ever happen. At this point, I'm afraid to transfer over to the other store I'm offered right now because of a few things.  One, the store itself is a nightmare. Everyone steals. Employees, customers, you name it.  Two, It's huge. More work. I feel like I bust my ass as it is. The story I hear about the new place is that no matter what happens, no matter what you do, it always gets undone. No matter how fast. You come in next shift and it's a warzone.  Three, The drive time. I don't want to commute again. I like having my 5 minutes to and from.  Now.. it's a good thing to transfer. Bigger store = more money and more hours. But that doesn't mean that it'll compensate for the amount of time taken from my day or the cash guzzling car's gas tank I'll be paying out the nose for.  The largest deterrant, however, is the fact that I'll have to close during the week. I don't want to. Closing's a pain in the ass. Sure, it's the easier of the two shifts, but hey, I don't like being up that late and not having anything to do when you get home because it's too late to watch a movie and you're too wound up to sleep. The only plus to that is that most likely, I'd no longer have to do inventory shifts.   At any rate, I decided not to take it. I just have to call the boss and tell her tomorrow. I want it, but they'd have to at least give me a 1.15 raise just to have me do it. That's what my time's going to cost them if they want me down there that badly. Which they won't. Heh.

"Torn. Need advice... Hey Reddit. I am not sure how to start all this but im going to explain to my best ability. Here goes. So, i have i had depression and anxiety give or take 3 years. I recently opened up about it to my girlfriend and she encouraged me to open up about it to my mother. I told her about almost everything. The one thing i did not mention to her was the... suicidal thoughts. Now, for our family “feelings” isnt our thing. We keep everything closed up and then repress it all. Thats what i have been doing for years not just with depression but everything. Now, these past three days have been brutal on me. I had no want to leave my bed or eat or even sleep. I just lay there and listen to music. I have been having suicial thoughts here and there these past three days. I will have happy moments here and there. But it doesnt last (shocker) and i just go back to feeling like pure awfulness. So, I am a 17 y/o male and I start senior year in August. We are a military family. My dream is the military. Thats all i have ever wanted. I want to follow my brothers footsteps because he is a total badass. All ive ever talked about to people, when they ask me what i want, to do is how badly i want to join the military. I do not think, with my current mental state, that i should go to the military. But i also fully believe that if i dont go i will disappoint everyone around me and they will be disgusted in me and i also believe that i will fall deeper into this dark hole i have been in. I have come to ask you guys, Any ideas on what to do? I am taking a cross country trip in 2 weeks with my brother and I will ask him some things about this and hopefully it will clear my head.   Thank you for reading.  I forgot to mention. I want to go get help. get put on medication. But the military doesnt accept people who are on anti depressants.

"I'm new here, and I ought for help.  For the past month I've had a crush on this girl  .. but not a normal crush .. a real CRUSH CRUSH, the type of crush you really feel you need her since the first time you see her. She is my friend as of right now, I want to ask her out  .. but I am afraid she rejects me, and she wouldn't be my friend anymore.  I've been with depression for the past 4 days already, I even had suicidal thoughts. Last night I was looking for a HotLine to call and tell my story, I felt like I needed to talk to somebody.   I have friends, but not those type of friends that you can rely on, tell your story, and cry on their shoulders. Basically, i'm by myself in this world.  I love my parents, but I never tried talking about it because I just can't. They wouldn't understand, they ask too many questions .. we even had a minor discussion about me telling my mom NOT to throw the water bottle (I told her 5 times not to throw it), and guess what she did .. she threw the water bottle .. and she told ""rrAhh, you should've told me"" .. Bad communication indeed, she needs to pay more attention to what I say.  I haven't eaten for a day because the depression has gotten worse .. last night a good ""cyber - friend"" logged on, and I knew I could talk to that person .. she's not kid, she's a grown woman (40 years old), she has kids, so I knew she would understand perfectly. She talked me into not thinking about suiciding because of that.  Last night was the day that I cried the most, in my entire life. I'm still depressed, a little bit relieved because I actually talked to someone and let all that out.  I just need advices, I've been thinking of that girl ALL the time .. I wrote her letters as a ""secret admirer"", the ending of the letter was always the same: ""To the world you might be one person, but to one person you might be the world.""  I was also thinking that I was going to ask her out .. but like I said above, I'm afraid she might reject me and I fall into a deeper depression.  Please help, what should I do?  I'm 16, and I live in Miami.  Thank you if you have read my story.  EDIT: I have lost my self - respect, and lowered my self - esteem, and feel like if I'm a nobody.

"I just feel trapped I'm finishing up my Masters degree and just feel hopeless right now. I hate school. I'm starting to hate my field of study too. I play the trumpet. But to be honest, I'm not very good at it. High notes, any other trumpet player will be able to understand. In the past two years, my playing has underwent some other terrible thing where I hesitate at the start of anything I play. It's 100 percent mental. I've made some strides in it, but it still comes back. For the past two years, it has made me feel like I can't even play a simple fucking melody to someone if asked. Trumpet is basically my adventure, but it seems like I just cause myself pain. I want to keep working on it, but boy it hurts my soul to suck and to keep not doing well. On top of that, I struggle with my weight. I love fast food. I know it's bad, but I use it to cope. I also would love to stop watching porn. I'm addicted to that. I've been addicted to that since I was probably in the 4th grade. I just feel trapped, like I don't have the self control or am not smart enough to discipline myself to fix these problems.

But anyway, I  was working and got a phone call from an old friend and asked me how excited i was that my best friend was getting engaged. I replied “I had no idea.” She just said, “Oh..” I’m so hurt. But I don’t really think her man cares. He doesn’t like me and our other friend for reasons unknown to me.

"You don't have to read this, it's just a short story.  A few years ago i was in love with a guy, we were in the same course at school.  I got so nervous every time I saw him. However, he didn't say a word to me. He ignored me. He didn't even look at me. I didn't want to ignore him, i tried to get his attention, but i just didn't manage. It frustrated me. I just didn't understand why he deliberately ignored me. I was so down, I started cutting again, didn't eat for days, ...  It lasted one year. The whole year he never said a word to me. Not even when my sister died.  I don't understand it today and I never will. I never will forget the pain. However, i don't blame him for ignoring me. Everybody has the right to ignore me. But it hurts me so much.  And today I always get the feeling people ignore me. And when people i care about do so, it's horrible. Maybe they don't deliberately ignore me, but i always think they do. For me it's the worst thing you can do to a person. It's worse than hating somebody.  I wrote a poem for this guy, it's not good, but i want to share it.

" I did my first real ride on the new frame during my commute home from work last night. I may need a new cassette, but I need to do some diagnostics before I throw money at the problem. My chain is slipping in the 21,19,and 18 cogs. The chain is new, of course, but the cassette only has twenty hours on it at best. I replaced my front inner chain ring after we built the frame up. It was worn slap out and you couldn't turn the pedals with any pressure without the chain jumping around like a lap dog.      My left knee was sore just under the cap and my hamstrings were aching during the ride in to the shop this a.m. I suspect my seat may need to come up a couple of millimeters, but the fit-stick says things are dead-on. If there is anything the past has taught me, it's not to monkey around with my position at the first sign of discomfort.      Ava and I made a ""tent"" with a bed sheet and two chairs last night. We huddled underneath while I read her favorite books.  I was supposed to go to my writer's group last night, but I stayed and spent time with Ava instead.  Typing it all up now gives me time to reflect on it and while last night I resented not going to the group (just a bit), this morning I know that April, Ava, and I are all better for me being home as much as possible. Ape lets me ride more than most wives, I'd imagine, so it's hard for me to complain at all.

"Crashing In Sorry this is long.  I've been depressed since I was 15. First signs were at age 4.  I found pot and stayed high for 8 years. Clean and sober for 30 years, I never stopped having suicidal thoughts despite medication. So I tried to bury the pain in relationships, which didn't work either. I've been married three times in recovery.  I had a daughter who I love very much, and we used to be very close.  She became a reason to live.  Then 4 years ago she didn't want to live with me 1/2 time any more. She became argumentative and we fought a lot.   Last year I found out she was accusing me of sexual abuse, with help from her mom ( first wife) and therapist, which is not true. The therapist never reported the abuse, and told daughter I have NPD, which also is not true.  So I got a guardian ad litem to investigate and found my daughter was suicidal, claiming PTSD because of the alleged molestation. The lawyer never helped my daughter, sparking a slide into deeper depression. My wife and parents didn't do much to try to help.  They got angry when I begged them to step in. Suidical ideation and inappropriate attention-getting threats became an actual plan, and a way to do it without leaving the stain of suicide.  Then at work I made a $5 billion discovery that is extremely disruptive in the industry I work in. My quarter million dollar program found out millions are being spent on the wrong strategy. And 1/2 my team works on the other strategy at the same time as they are helping me, so they are taking steps to undermine the findings. Lately they gave up trying to block the discovery, and the fact that we can literally feed more people with no more land used for farming, by raising more animals (naturally) with the same amount of feed. I'm getting invited to speak globally about the discovery. The suicidal thoughts deepen, knowing the disruption to status quo is only beginning.  Just before Christmas my third wife moved out, and I spent Christmas alone because my parents were sick. Last night she told my mom she intends to get a divorce.   The medicine isn't working. The AA old timers are saying I'm depressed because I'm not working the steps correctly. I'm going to 2-3 meetings a day, most days.  In two days I'm shutting down the case I opened to try to get help for my daughter.   I can hardly work, because I can't complete thoughts very well any more, being so depressed.  I've been complaining about feeling depressed and suicidal, because it's true, and it became a way to relate to the world, which makes people leave. The spiral is getting tighter, and it feels like a black hole is pulling me in. I can't imagine facing another divorce feeling this low.  Mom said to get a roast beef out of the freezer and cook it with some potatoes and carrots and stop thinking about negative things. I went to Landmark and they say this is all just a story, and part of a racket I created to avoid responsibility. They say I can create something different by changing my story.  I've tried a rainbow of medicine, and tomorrow I increase Latuda from 20 mg to 40, and keep the trintellex at 20, per MD.   I can't do anything now because third wife will get 1/2, and parents are too old to deal with my belongings. My thoughts turn to seeing if I can find someone else who will love me anyway, or giving up. I want to give up but not really.  I really want to live, but I can't see any hope. And I can't stand the thought of being alone.   Any help, hope or ideas would be appreciated.

" Today I got my Orange belt in Choi Kwang Do. The last ""light"" colored belt before Green which goes into the darker colored belts. I took the pictures tonight of the belt ceremony using my wife's Fuji S2. Sharp camera! Since I am an asst instructor I am now teting every month. I have my patterns down through Green belt, and plan on learning Blue and Purple patterns this week. :)  This weekend I did my first ""non-official"" videography event - a ""reception"" party for a couple that was married in Hawaii several months ago. Luckily it did not rain since it was an outside event. :) I took about 2 hours of film. I would think that a wedding would have actually been easier since there are actual ""events"" that you have to capture. This was basically just a party and therefore I became more the voyeur than the observer like normal weddings in that I had to walk around taping interesting converstaions. Luckily the bride & groom both have very outgoing personalities as do most of their close friends. My wife was the photographer (http://oneclickawayphoto.com) so in some cases I followed her around. But as the night wore on and the drinks became more potent I was able to pull out some interesting stories from some of the key attendees. Though I was really wanting Grandma to participate but she did not like the idea of being taped. Must be a generational thing. :)  Have you ever had a mental image of someone you worked with over long distances, but then when you actually met them or saw their picture realized your image was WAY off base? Had that happen today. Man - talk about being wrong. :)   Anyway - I'm off to play XBox. Later!

Husbands Family So long story short my husband use to live with his older brother and his wife and kids. My husband was always there for the kids he grew really attached to them. But since we got together and then got married he saw the kids less and less. So yesterday his brother’s wife texted him and asked him not to forget about his niece and nephew that they really miss him and that they notice that he no longer spends time with them. She says they are sad. So it kind of made me angry because ever since we got together my husbands mom his brother and the mother of the kids have always tried to push the kids on him. One time we had them over and we’re going to drop them off and well they got mad because we couldn’t keep them.  They always want him to be there for them like if he’s the father and he’s not his just the uncle. And I don’t like when he brings them over because it’s like they don’t even acknowledge I am here. The kids don’t like me and it’s noticeable I guess they’re mad because I took their uncle away. I’m I wrong for getting mad at this I mean we are going to have our on kids some day and I don’t need them getting jealous or not liking my kids only because he will no longer spend time with them. ,0,husband family long story short husband use live older brother wife kid husband kid grew really attached them got got married saw kid le yesterday brother wife texted asked not forget niece nephew really miss notice longer spends time them say sad kind angry got husband mom brother mother kid tried push kid him time going drop got mad not them want like father not just uncle not like brings like not acknowledge here kid not like noticeable guess mad took uncle away wrong getting mad mean going kid day not need getting jealous not liking kid longer spend time them
"What a great topic!! The news always makes me cry - and I end up turning it off shortly after I start watching it - why do I punish myself? My parents know that I have learned to not watch the news because of the negative effect it has on me, so if something really important is going on, they let me know. My Aunt suffers from chronic depression and delusion, and I've had numerous conversations with her on how to handle the depression because she's tried so many different things, even going to Mexico to see a Shaman. Her top 3 suggestions (and I really go by them as much as I possibly can) are: 1) Get proper sleep - this is probably the most paramount point; 2) get proper nutrition; and 3) don't watch the news. The one thing that I absolutely cannot tolerate is sad news about animals - that really sends me. When I'm flipping thru channels and happen upon Animal Planet and the Animal Police are busting people because of their cruelty - I have to turn it immediately. I think I'm delusional too in that I choose not to watch the news, animal stories, anything really unpleasant - I guess I try to live in my little world without negativity or sadness. I know that it isn't very mature or adult, but this is my coping mechanism. I do find that when I hear or see anything sad or awful that my negativity really gets into gear, and then I'm completely negative for awhile. Driving is also incredibly difficult because I commute into Washington D.C. from the suburbs and traffic is awful. I become so negative about the other drivers around me that I end up hating myself over my thoughts about them! They, of course, drive too slow and are idiots. I need to find a job close to home! I too have sometimes felt that the human race needs to think about not populating the world anymore. I wouldn't want to raise a small child in this environment any more! I'm glad my son is in college and he's the only one that I could have. But then again, I can't wait until my sister or brother has kids so that I can be with them and spoil them rotten. Crazy isn't it? I have taken others suggestions in this thread and have tried to make myself think positively the last 2 days. It's difficult but possible! I notice that my mood has brightened somewhat too.

"How do you tell your kids to handle weird adults? When I was 14, my best friend's mom started accusing me of smoking. I'd been best friends with her daughter since we were in 1st grade and I was over their house all the time. But for some reason when I was 14, she started asking. And she very low key but repeatedly accused me of smoking for about 2 more years. I had always been a straight A kid, top of my class, and a ""good"" kid. I had tried one cigarette when I was 13, had HATED it, and never tried another. I wasn't around anyone who smoked, no friends, no peers, no family members (immediate or extended) smoked, so there's no chance I smelled like smoke. But friend's mom persisted, and told me that she thought that I smoked because she found cigarette butts at the end of their driveway. Because obviously that couldn't have been from anyone else right?  Now in hindsight, her behavior was absolutely bizarre. As a teen, I accepted it as, she's an adult, and while I questioned her and vigorously fought back whenever she'd say something, it never occurred to me to get a sane adult involved. I'm hoping to install in my kid that they should tell me stuff like that if it ever happens. While nothing truly bad happened in my case, the lady was off her rocker, and I'm lucky nothing else happened.  How did people with older kids do that? Like I know my parents gave me the ""if people are making you uncomfortable, talk to us"" speech but this never made me upset, I just got angry and baffled at first, but then it kind of became this joke among all our friends and we just laughed at her. In hindsight, this could have ended very poorly for me had the mom escalated.

" I was having a relatively average Friday at work when I decided to step outside for a fresh dose of nicotine and a butt scratch. As I was revelling in the sensation of my fading itch I noticed a flock of geese flying overhead. Inevitably the lead goose (I like to refer to the leader as ""the big cheese"") was cut down by a nudist pole vaulting midget (sorry, ""small person"" [I really like the brackets today]). As the two came crashing to the ground in a whirling pile of blood, puss  ; soft white bird feces I had a rather embarrasing moment of my own. A horrid scent tickled my senses. It was the kind of scent one doesn't pick up from a big cheese and a small person colliding 40 feet in the air. No, this scent was a little closer to home. Only after I felt the squishiness between my lower cheeks did I realize what had taken place. Some form of monsterous human being must have stolen my pants right off my body while I was distracted by the mid air catastrophy. This foul being then made doo-doo in my brand new Tazmanian Devil boxers before carefully placing them back on my body. A change of shorts and a roll of toilet paper later I began my hunt for the elusive undergarment defiling creature. Armed with only a plastic fork and a half burnt cigarette I patrolled the nearby streets for nearly half an hour when it hit me. Perhaps some of the other lower to middle class working folk in the area had been violated by the underpants bandit. I went to my truck and grabbed my CSI kit I ordered off the net. It arrived last night, just in time for me to uncover the mystery of the soiled ginch. Unfortunately I was unable to find any evidence outside of my own underpants. There didn't seem to be any eye witnesses either. Maybe they had been paid off or were just too afraid to talk. The bandit must have got to them.

"I often ponder the idea of giving up completely. Has anyone given up completely? How does it feel like?   I have had extreme depression for 11 years. For as long as I can remember I have tried so hard to stay alive. There was a point in my life where I gave up. I remember my mom was beating me and I put up my hands to block the belt and I was crying. I remember after one of the times she struck me I started to think “what if I gave up?” And I just shut down. In that moment I stopped putting my hands up, stopped crying, and rolled into a ball while mom kept beating me for a few more minutes.   For a few years after that I stopped caring about my appearance. I got so fat and I just kept eating and eating. I stopped caring about my grades and didn’t even try. I would just turn in a blank paper with my name on it.   During high school I woke up and started to try again even though it was really hard. Since then I haven’t stopped. I regularly do thing I don’t want to do in an effort to make it by. I get up at 5, I shower every day, I go to the gym, I do my homework, study, etc.   Currently, I have been working my butt off to be able to join the military to get away from my parents. My depression is acting up so much, it’s getting really hard to keep trying. I often find myself daydreaming and pondering how good/easy it would feel/be to just stop what I’m doing and give up. Get in bed, stay in bed, go eat, eat some more, and more, finally not caring about my appearance and just not doing anything in general.

"The last 3 days felt like the first days of my life. Today feels like the beginning of the last days. I have been having depression since Senior Year. I have been fighting non stop for 5 years. I took gap years to fight depression. Until last October, I thought depression has gone cause i felt totally normal at that time. During the time, I had a lot of ups and downs. Lots of tears, lots of laugh. But i have never given up on myself  Last November, my brother did sth bad. And my ex attempted suicide. That is when i got depressed again. The first time in 2 years   Until 3 days ago, I met a girl. ""Perfect stranger"" is the word that would suit her the most. My situation with her is exactly like in the movie ""Before we go"" by Chris Evan. 2 strangers meet each other out of 7 billion people but they would never see each other again. And 3 days after we met ( we hung out everyday for the last 3 days), she is gone. We still keep contact but I dont think i would ever see her again ( please dont ask why). She knows about depression. She made me make a promise to reach out to her every time i get depressed.  The last 3 days were the happiest days of my life. It feels like I actually live for the first time. But i also got depressed since. I got depressed because i couldn't recall her image. I couldnt recall her face. I couldn't recall what she looked like when we first met. And i couldnt remember why those were the happiest days of my life. I just recall those were the happiest. All i can recall is a brief moment of her smile for like 5-10 secs, her voice, and the moment when we were about to say good bye that i poured out my heart. Everything is so blurry.    Then i went on to google to search for blurry memories and depression. And it leads me to ""depression and memory loss"" and "" depression and Alzheimer "" . Then i started to shed tears. I was thinking about the day i actually lost my memories. What if it actually comes, What if one day i wouldnt remember her, my mom, my best friends, and even myself ? I was teaching in class when i shed tears. I had to run to the bathroom and cried in there for 15 mins. Luckily noone noticed.  I remembered my promise to her. I was about to text her. And then i started to cry again. I will bother her. I will make her worried. I will waste her time. And i cant afford to hurt people i love.  This is the beginning of the end.

Also argues that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene. well i'm not going to go in depth to argue anything, but i think Dan Brown made lots of mistakes in his assumptions. for example, he writes that Peter was the one in the picture "" The Last Supper "" who was making threatening gestures. apparently that man is Judas Iscariot, not Simon Peter. that explains a lot about the hand gestures.

Since then, he still hasn't learned his lesson and STILL continues to throw these huge fits when he doesn't get his way.  We've had a rough past, and he doesn't realize that since my mom is always working that I'm basically the one that's in charge around here. I'm not bossy, either, I am completely fair. But since I've always been the one to do everything, he's used to sitting on his overweight ass all day playing video games. Now that I'm a full time college student, I don't have time to do things around the house that I could before. He refuses to do anything including even fixing his bed.  I tell my mom ALL the time to do something but even if she does, he'd throw a fit. I seriously think he just needs to be put on medication because his behavior is very VERY out of control.  We've been arguing and fighting so bad daily for the past year or two and it's just getting progressively worse. I don't know what to do. I seriously would move out right now but that's not an option as I don't have time to work a full time job and take 17 credits while paying for schooling AND rent/utilities/gas/etc.  It's just becoming such a toxic place to come home to that I just stay at the library or starbucks because I dread coming home because I know he'll always start something, but even when I do come home it's always yelling and fighting even if I bite my tongue and stay silent.   He DOES NOT LISTEN!!! He thinks HE'S in control. If he were my child, I would've taken every possession he has (iPhone, Xbox, etc) and made him sit in his room all day being forced to read a book and learn to respect people older than him! He talks back to my mom A LOT, and the thing that makes me mad is we won't even do anything to him.  I know people will be trying to say, ""Well maybe don't try to boss him around"" but the thing is I DON'T. I'll just be like, ""Make sure you clean your half of the room"" or ""Be sure to take the dog out"" or ""Make sure you unload the dishwasher"".  I don't know what to do anymore. I think I'm gonna force him to go sleep in the basement because I haven't even gotten a full nights rest since summer and I feel like I'm starting to get depressed. Every day he's always calling me names, and it gets so bad that I have to call him something back in order for him to even realize what he's saying to me.  I'm just so over this and this extra stress is seriously making me feel nauseous trying to balance school along with it. I've tried talking to a few people about this, but all they say is, ""Awe it'll get better"". WELL AT THE RATE IT'S GOING NOW, IT WONT. I just don't know what to do. It would be a lot easier if I had my own room so I could get a quiet space for privacy and alone time away from him.

"How are you? I am not okay. I’m in a kind of adverse situation, my thoughts are all over the place and I really don’t know how to break this cycle. Basically what happened was that a few days ago, I sent my best friend a message before school, saying that I wouldn’t attend classes because I wasn’t feeling too well, that I felt like giving up and that, in case I also wouldn’t have been at school the following day, I had probably killed myself. I wasn’t joking. Sometimes I get these sort of “impulses”, most likely caused by me being overwhelmed by my emotions, my thoughts, and as a result of that, it feels as though I lose my common sense, my ability to think rationally. My thought patterns become unpredictable, but so far I’ve managed to not act on them, or else I wouldn’t be writing this right now. Currently they’ve been happening a lot more frequently than usual and that seriously freaks me out because during those times death seems like such a good solution to my problems. So, back to the story. Obviously, my friend got really concerned and encouraged me to come to her place because she’d been staying at home that day. BUT she also contacted my mom, which I didn’t know until hours later, and told her that I wasn’t at school and made a concerning remark, but I don’t know exactly. My mom started to call me like every minute and I started to panic because I thought a teacher had called her, so I didn’t pick up any of her calls. I spent the rest of the day with my friend, but called my mom in the afternoon. She asked my where I was and it sounded like she was crying and I told her that I was at my friends place, but after that she declined the call. That night I slept at my dads place, my mom called him and told him that she didn’t care anymore about what I was doing and that kind of hit me. It was the last thing I wanted to hear in that situation. I just don’t know what to do. I really do feel miserable. My friend is beating herself up because she thinks it’s all her fault and I don’t know, I just feel bad for feeling bad, if you know what I mean. That message was a cry of help in a kind of way and I don’t understand why my mom reacted the way she did. It just makes me think that maybe everyone is really better off without me. I’ve been depressed for nearly five years now, but my mom never really paid attention to it and just marked me down as lazy. I’ve been doing great for a good six months in 2017, but then somebody really important to me, somebody that kept me going, passed away in December and since then everything had taken a turn for the worse. Life has become so hard for me, I’m sleeping the days away because I can’t bear the thoughts, the guilt, because I’m too much of a coward to face reality. I’m trying, I really am, but no matter what I do, this feeling, this feeling that eradicates my will to live, remains.",1,you not okay kind adverse situation thought place really not know break cycle basically happened day ago sent best friend message school saying not attend class not feeling well felt like giving that case not school following day probably killed myself not joking sort impulse likely caused overwhelmed emotion thought result that feel lose common sense ability think rationally thought pattern unpredictable far managed not act them not writing right now currently happening lot frequently usual seriously freak time death like good solution problem so story obviously friend got really concerned encouraged come place staying home day contacted mom did not know hour later told not school concerning remark not know exactly mom started like minute started panic thought teacher called her did not pick call spent rest day friend called mom afternoon asked sounded like cry told friend place declined call night slept dad place mom called told did not care anymore doing kind hit me thing wanted hear situation just not know do really feel miserable friend beating think fault not know just feel bad feeling bad know mean message help kind way not understand mom reacted way did just make think maybe really better me depressed nearly year now mom really paid attention just marked lazy doing great good month somebody really important me somebody kept going passed away december taken turn worse life hard me sleeping day away bear thought guilt coward face reality trying really am matter do feeling feeling eradicates live remains
"In the mood to vent So I'm gonna make this self deprivating post quick. I was a sick child. Shit was fucked. Too young to understand what was going on and had lots of surgeries and what not. I possibly have autism, I was diagnosed with sensory processing disorder to get O.T. however I think they gave me that so I wasn't stuck with the label of autism. I think they believed I was too young to be diagnosed and so I never got a checkup from a psychiatrist after O.T. . So it's possible I'm autistic but idk. Anyway my childhood was shit. Absolute fucking garbage. I was the loser kid. Had physical issues so I never left the house. I was ugly and fat. My entire childhood was just a big fucking waste of time. Anyway I become 16 and start hanging around bad kids. At this point I lost all fucks to give about my schooling. My social skills were finally developed enough so I can make friends but I didn't really like any of them. I started getting a prescription for drugs. It wasn't very difficult given my medical history. Started taking Adderall daily. And my mom would occasionally give me some Xanax she had. Also started drinking. I guess some warning signs for a shitty life but idk. I'm not entirely sure what to do at this point. I plan on going to community college since I'm probably gonna drop out of HS soon. I just don't think I'm ready for the real world.

" So, I swear I meet someone everyday that is so profound, I dont think that I ever have the thoughts to equate to their greatness. I met this guy once who changed my life in 2 days of subbing for one of my classes. A free-lance actor, better yet, a free-lance thinker. I can see why people say that when you meet the right person you could run away with them and nothing would ever matter.  In the book Catch 22, they talk about running away. And they debate, that running away is bad, because your problems will eventually come back to haunt you, and the conclusion was that he wasnt running away, he was running to his problems, rather making his life more interesting with every second that he spends.  Sometimes, with all of my set ""life-plans"" I want to not forget, that I cant live in--what will happen in the future, but rather in this moment. I never want to be the girl who is uncontent with this moment, because I cant wait for the next moment.  Could that free-lance thinker help me run away. All i know is that, when I want a serious relationship and even think about marriage, I want to meet someone exactly like him. Who I can ""run away"" with, to solve my problems head on, and live in this moment.

"Hello Tommy! to DF! I'm glad you joined! This board is a great place for information and support. Take your time browsing through the topics. I'm sure there will be lots of things you can relate to. When you feel comfortable enough, feel free to share any of your thoughts, questions, concerns, experiences, etc...Congrats on taking your first steps towards recovery! I think it takes a lot of courage to start treatment. I know it took me quite a while to admit to myself I couldn't handle my situation on my own any longer. I think you did great starting on both talk therapy and medicines! I hope you find therapy useful and that you and your therapist can work towards better skills to cope with the stressors in your life. Concerning your medication. There's a room dedicated to your antidepressant Prozac. You'll find lots of information there. Check it out sometime. One of the downsides of antidepressants is the fact that it takes a while for them to kick in. You only started about 10 days ago so you'll have to give the Prozac some time to be able to fully benefit from it. Meanwhile I hope you're not having too many side effects! Tom, thanks for joining.

I’m so alone... I’m almost 20 and I’ve never been in a relationship before. I’ve only been rejected by 4 guys and 2 girls. One of them is my closest friend. He says that if I was a girl he would be with me. This makes me feel like I have to change myself in order to be his. Even then I still don’t think he’ll be with me. I’m in love with him because he’s one of the only people who makes me feel like I matter. I just wonder if I’m even going to have anyone in the future... Dating websites/apps are also out of the question because no one wants to talk to me no matter how hard I try. ,1,alone relationship before rejected guy girl closest friend say girl me make feel like change order his not think me love people make feel like matter just wonder going future dating websitesapps question want talk matter hard try
"I went to this meeting. It was for people who have depression. The leader said to me that I was so knowledgeable I should be well. I was very sick at the time.  Which went to show me I had knowledge but no wisdom. For years I knew this. I read all the books and nothing changed. I really felt like maybe I was on the wrong line of thought to get over the depression. Yet I did feel better. I thought my life isn't changing though.  I have so many hopes and dreams for my life and here I am sitting around wasting it. I still feel like that at times but then something bad happened and I didn't react to it. I didn't feel worse. Then someone did something stupid and I didn't yell at them. I went to a friend and asked if she thought I was getting better. Her answer was. Hell Yeah. You bother to talk to me now. It seems she was doing all the talking at one stage. I didn't know.  It's been 10 years since I first got depressed In all the tests on the computer it went from severe depression to moderate the other day I got mild depression. Ok today its back to moderate. I think the reason for this is that I'm nearly there with a thought process and I just can't get it. I'm kicking myself for it for being incompetent and those words from that woman came back you have all this knowledge you should be better. Do I need to go back and do some stuff on self esteem again? Is this what this is about. I look inside of me and see my self esteem has fallen apart again ......... and I mean again! How many times is this? 100? a 1000 times?  Why can't I work this out? I don't know what is wrong.  I think if she asked me now, I would tell her, I haven't got all the answers yet. Somehow I wished she was right. That with what I knew I could just be better.  I'm off to hit the books. :-/ Isn't depression ironic? You can feel bad about anything even a compliment.  By the way. I'm still procrastinating. It's better though. I think. Not that much though I have so much to do. OK that is wrong isn't it?  I'm heading to the quiet of my bedroom to study. I hope.

"It's hard to keep standing up, keep fighting, and get down each time. I just want it to end I’m done. Hard work doesn’t pay off. Ever since I was 14 I felt depressed and like I’m not good enough. I felt like it was my own fault that I felt so sad and angry and that I wasn’t good enough for other people. One day I decided that if it we’re my own fault I felt that way then I could also improve my situation. Al my negative emotions went into working hard.   I finished my studies (not by working hard, but because I was good at it) and put all negative emotions into working out. I got accepted into a difficult job at the Army. Now I quit the Army because of an injury in my knees. At the same time I lost a girl, even though we only went on one date, I thought she could be the one positive thing to take from the Army and all the hard work I put in to get into the Army.   So what’s my situation now? Jobless, girls still despise me, have a degree with which I can’t find a job with and all the work I put into improving my situation was for nothing.   While trying to improvie myself and during my studies and time at the Army I still had periods where I felt very down. It just becomes harder and harder and harder to crawl out of it every time. The negative voices and feelings are too much and getting up to fight just becomes impossible.  I had the power once to get up and try to fight. Now I don’t even have the power to suicide. But I just wish it was all over.   Eventhough it feels useless I might go to a psychologist. How has it helped you guys? I wan’t to end it all but I don’t want to end it all. I don’t know. I feel lost and sinking deeper every damn time.

It was the first time my friends were introduced to him. My girlfriends went on and on about how hot he was. Eric, my ex, was actually the first to tell me, ""he is a handsome guy,"" which I thought was really funny. We got extremely drunk and danced all night long. He came home with me, but I puked before anything could happen.  I like Greg. He is smart and he challenges me intellectually. He is also a great dancer and an awesome kisser. I just dont know if I want a man in my life. I've developed this weird fear of men when it comes to intimacy. Things are a bit different with Greg, probably because he's not acting like he is in love with me. I wonder when he will call again....

"Hi folks, I've only discovered this topic after making several previous posts :) I am from a traditional Asian culture, but now half-westernized on migration to Australia since age 6. I've had a long history that stems right to my parents' histories before I was born. To cut it very short, my father has schizoid/schizotypal/socially withdrawn personality traits, and my mother has dependent traits, so they basically had a loveless marriage (common in my culture). There is a long history of parental quarrelling and physical abuse on my mother before and after I was born, some of which I heard as a child to early teens. I was seldom exposed socially growing up, and I had few school friends. I was also 'born' a quiet person, but this and lack of socializing made me a withdrawn kid. When I was about 4, I believe I experienced one psychotic episode (I 'saw' 2 caped 'grim reapers' at that time), since which I have no further experiences. I experienced a few bouts of depression during secondary school, for which I didn't seek help because of my shyness and parental/cultural stigma that 'depression does not exist' (thankfully my family has ditched that attitude now). During that time, I had many suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide maybe 3 times but didn't tell anyone about it. A very terrible incident also happened towards the end of high school - one night, I physically assaulted my father while he was quarrelling with mom, and he was hospitalized. I got charged with assault, but no conviction was recorded after I did psychotherapy for anger control - that was also the only therapeutic contact with psychological/psychiatric services I had until very recently. That incident, although I felt numb through that time, has been scarred into my memory - I can still recall the events, and my conscience is still wrecked over it, though I continue to fight it and let it go. At school, I was a top-end academic achiever in science and math. I was named dux of the school on graduation. Upon entering university, my depression became worse mainly because of increased social isolation. I was still shy and withdrawn, I lost contact with my high school friends (they also saw me as 'weird', but I was also a bit narcissistic towards them at some times - I think it was an unconscious aggressive reaction towards them), and failed to make any lasting friendship with university peers. One year into university, I started studying Medicine, which I am still doing at the moment. However I felt that course had over time did not improve me, though I did make few friends. I still felt unable to socialize with peers, even though I was in constant contact with them through many lectures and tutorials. Even though I was an average performer, I felt I struggled heavily through the years with study. Late last year, my depression hit a new low - my parents had another quarrel, and I was studying psychiatry which forced me to realize the extensiveness of my past and current problems. It was another awful time - I lost a lot of self-confidence/esteem, became more withdrawn. I ended up failing my first practical exam but still passed given my past satisfactory academic record - the faculty put it down to lack of practice, but the truth is because of what I experienced leading up to the exam. In this year however my depressive bouts became much worse - my few friends had deferred, and I was left with no friends, despite still knowing the others 'by name'. My experience during this year was largely negative - I felt harassed by teaching doctors, peers, being looked at as a 'weirdo' and excluded from conversations and their social outings (whether this was a valid view, I'm finding out now by resocializing with them - my main aim at the moment). Over the last 2 months I had about 5 more depressive episodes, and attempted suicide 3 times, again nobody knew about them. It became a frantic situation - I approached the faculty dean for help, but he only recommended me a psychiatrist, who he was supposed to contact before I contacted him. However that psychiatrist wasn't notified, and I felt very angry about it and thought that nobody was out there to help me. In retrospect, my view was unrealistic - help only exists on a professional level, something I knew long before but did not acknowledge at that time, making me upset. My depression faded away a few days later. A few nights ago, I had a short dispute with mom, got upset and this eventually led to me joining this forum after a quick search on the net. Why am I writing this intro? Several reasons. I want to tell my story to others, and feel this is a stepping stone to encourage myself. I also want others not yet aware that depression can affect ANYONE, even the best of us, even those involved in the medical profession (up to 30% of junior doctors suffer from depression, and up to 10% have attempted/committed suicide). I want to improve my own situation - most of all, learning to deal with feelings of sadness and negatively that has crippled me mentally in the past, and my lack of sociability which doesn't help my situation. I know deep inside I am capable of pulling through, of being able to live a normal healthy life because I am aware of my problems and have the power to deal with them.

"Brother owes Mother money, lives with her and isn't paying rent. Advice please? Not really sure which sub is the best place for this, so I've cross-posted in r/family, r/legaladviceuk and r/advice. Please let me know if any of them are inappropriate or if there are better subs for this. Thanks!  The back story to this is long and possibly convoluted, but the tl;dr is my brother has had financial troubles for many years. In 2012, after the death of our grandmother, our mother paid off a large sum of my brothers' debts. He then paid some of this back with his own inheritance from the same. As a result of various relationship and/or financial cock-ups he has then loaned various further sums from our mother but with almost no repayments. He then ends up in a position to either bail out back to our mothers or lose employment and go wherever it is you go when you have no home or job.  To be frank, we (myself, my partner and my mother) are at a loss as to what to do next. We think that perhaps we only have one realistic option (to kick my brother out and cut our losses) but this is something we would rather avoid. So we're asking Reddit for advice. So to  (try yet fail to) cut a long story short...  My brother moved back in with my mother in early December 2017 due to the breakup of a relationship. When he did so, he agreed (verbally) to both pay a very reasonable rate of rent and payments towards previous debts owed toward our mother (both monthly). He was given December as a 'payment holiday' of sorts. Two weeks later my brother took out a loan to replace his car as he needed transport to and from work. His previous vehicle was written off toward the end of his previous relationship and he did not replace it with the money gained from the resultant insurance claim. Due to poor credit history, our mother was guarantor for this loan.  Due to concerns regarding my brothers previous unreliability with regards to money my mother decided to make a written and witnessed agreement with my brother regarding rent, the loan, and payment of previous debts. However, we are all collectively broke (not as broke as my brother) and so paid legal advice was out of the question. After some research I drafted a basic agreement, it was signed and witnessed by my mother, brother, partner and myself. In hindsight I should probably have used a solicitor for this but it is what it is.   Fast-forward to 05/02/2018 and no payments have been received for anything. My mother received both an email and text alert for late payment on the loan that she is guarantor of on 31/01/18 but no other correspondence. She has not contacted the loan company but has received no further correspondence so believes my brother has paid this instalment at least. My mother also received a phone call from the garage that my brother bought he new car from, for which he loaned the entirety of the cost as the majority of the loan my mother is guarantor. He still owes them money.   In short, besides kicking him out of my mothers house and saying goodbye to both my brothers previous debts (and therefore a large amount of my mothers money) and also resigning my mother to paying for the loan he took out in December, what can we do? Does the written agreement we made mean anything legally? What can I do to help my mother claim the money she lent previously? Or are these things lost causes?   Any and all help is much appreciated. We just don't know what to do, but don't want to see my  brother completely on his arse (unless I've put him on it...).   TL;DR My brother owes my mother a significant amount of money, lives with her, she is guarantor for one of his loans, he has not paid his agreed rent etc. and we know he owes others money. What do we do now? Can kick him out, don't want to, seems likely may have to soon. Cannot live with or afford this.

"Best friend of 7 years dropped me like nothing. So I'm in an LDR, and my boyfriend came to visit where I live for the first time. It was our second meeting so we were so happy to be together. So I took him to meet my best friend who had supported me in my relationship because she had a similar situation going on. After my visit with him at her house, I asked if we could go over again the next night and she told me no because I third wheeled her in her own house. However, I don't feel we did that because we weren't affectionate around her and her parents were in the room as well. A little after he left I apologize to her even though I didn't feel I had done anything wrong. Recently, she has deleted me off most social media platforms and if Imma be honest... I don't care.   Yes. I miss having the girl companion, having another girl to talk to about things. But, I don't want a friend that isn't a true friend.

I have a bad personality that appears good. My personality is a result of childhood abuse and depression. I was treated like a subordinate not worthy of shit growing up and now as an adult I'm a people pleaser to the extent of ruining my own life to help others even if they dont need it because I worry about my reputation and want people to constantly think I'm a really good person. I know that it isn't good behaviour but I don't know how to be outside of that. It feels nice to get praised for it but I really want to start accomplishing things for myself and let people handle their own business. I want to be someone. I don't even feel like a person half the time. There are too many ways to be and I don't know which one is a good fit for me. It's definitely not this. I'm not really sure what to do and I'm sure no one could really answer this for me but I really wanted to get it off my chest. Idk if anyone else is like this but it sucks. I was doing some research and found martyr syndrome and it really kicked me off my pedalstool and I feel like a piece of shit that sets too high standards and takes too much responsibility on and makes people feel bad. I thought I was just a super nice person but I'm actually an asshole victimizing myself constantly and blaming it on others.

A little less sad tonight I really don't know what to say anymore. I can't say anything about stuff I love to people without feeling like I am a burden to them.    Tonight I landed my first kickflip from the street on to the curb. I've been skating for about 10 years now and never been able to do that until now. It may not seem like a lot but it's a challenge that I've faced with fear most of my life. I'm so happy right now I have no one to share it with so I thought this would be the best place to share it with. I normally don't feel happy anymore or generally feel content but right now I do and I want everyone to share something that they're proud of or something that made them hopeful or brought them comfort in a time of misery. ,1,little sad tonight really not know say anymore say stuff love people feeling like burden them tonight landed kickflip street curb skating year able now not like lot challenge faced fear life happy right share thought best place share with normally not feel happy anymore generally feel content right want share proud hopeful brought comfort time misery
"A bad relationship and my current state of mind I'm 21 and i'm going to share some of my experience.   So, i meet this girl on the internet in my later 17's , i was an active practitioner of Karate Kyokushin, Muay Thai and Box back then, i was about to enter in the amateurs and start to compete, i even went to japan 2 times on the championship and training grounds.  Then, i meet this one girl , i had just left an relationship with another girl that end up with her cheating on me and well..i was even younger than now and i knew it how to fight, so..I beat the crap out of the guy and was disgusted by woman and by fighting like that again , i was so frustrated that i was traded by a 14 old boy (geez) but i overcome that.  When i meet this girl (I'd call her Kim from now on) i was clear about all that situation and that i was not up for a relationship with her or anyone else.   She was earning a place in my heart because Kim seems so different from other girls and was treating me well, she respected my hobbies, my dreams (it was 5 months to 18 years and i was going to join the military because IT WAS MY DREAM) and myself as a ''man''.  So, she visited me, i visited her, we were 2 states of distance of each other, but ''never too far to our love don't reach each other'' bullshit (387 Miles) and of couse we started to dating and have sex, and all the vows of love, you guys know what i'm talking..   Then i was on my 18, i had finished a test if i was join the military as a seargent or if i was enter like a corporal and I WAS SUCEED \o/ . But on the other hands, Kim, that i had met 6 months ago was  through a rough part of her life, she had lost her job, she wasn't paying the bills and was about to get dumped from the house she was living (all alone) and then, i talked to my parents if i could help her by inviting her to come home with us, i was about to change my life, i was about to work twice as hard and so i did.   I called her and say ''Hey, just sell your things, don't worry about it, we're gonna buy new ones baby'' Hell yea, like a fucking Alpha and she was so happy and she cried and she was all ''omg i love u so much'' Then i left all my trainings hobbies which gives me a lot of stress but i had back then a ''major reason '' for that and i was happy with her.  Then Kim's past started to show up to us. A family of 5, me, my little brother, my mom and dad and now Kim.  The thing is, Kim had a daughter that was with her aunts back then and she started to say she missed her, she was sad, she was feeling bad because she couldn't find a job yet (3 months had passed, it was a rough time on the Brazil enonomically speaking)but HEY, i had 2 jobs and i wouldn't give up, she was sad that i had to work so hard to :  1- Help my parents  2- ""Pay"" For her in the house.  I was saving money too, because other than spending money with that 2  things i didn't have the time to do other things so some free time i had we would watch a movie, take some ice cream, have sex (a lot, geez) and that money that i was saving began to get bigger and bigger, till the point that i was thinking about buying some ground to maybe started to build our own house in the future when she get a job and started to help me .  We would visit Kim's daughter from time to time and i start to love the girl, she was do damn smart but had a sadness in her that i could see, and one day in the house of Kim's Aunt, Her aunt came to me alone with Kim in the grocery store and started to say that i should stop my relationship with her.  I was shocked by the comment, but cold as ice in the outside and just asked 'wth are u talking about ?"" then she started to say that Kim had beat her daughter so damn hard that almost killed her and that's why she was not with Kim anymore and she say Kim it's fckng crazy and all type of shit and i was pissed off.   When we get back to home , i say to Kim what her aunt has spoken and she started to cry (and i was worried) and telled me a story (that isn't even worth bring it here for u guys) that in fact was another person who beat her daughter.   Well, time had passed, we didn't talked about it anymore and we were hanging out and she turns to me and say ""What about we did a lil shot ? "" (That is the equivalent on Brazilian to ""LET'S SMELL COCAINE)i was ""What ?"" and she ""Yea, it will be fun, i will let you do it in my sexy belly if you want"" . It's unbelievable how someone so damn pretty and hot and smart and intelligent and perfect could turn into a fucking piece of shit so god damn fast.  I refuse the ''offer'' and started to yell at her and started to talk some monstruous shit about it, like ""it was because of that you daughter almost died ?"" and everything, i was pissed off, sayed some shits that i shouldn't , she say it too but we overcome it.   So, i was with Kim about 2 years by now AND THEN SHE FINALLY GETS A JOB. we had moved on from my parents house a long time ago but i was not happy because Kim's past started to bother me.   In that time i discovery somethings new about her (with 100% sure before you ask) :  1- She did sex for money , even when she knew me and just talked to me back then.  2- Her ex was a asshole that was aprisioned .  3- She lied as fuck to me about almost everything, her life, her family (like ""my dad is dead"" type of lie), her past, her path.   But this is past RIGHT ? right ? maybe i should just 'fuck off' and get back to my parents house but love is a sick joke.  Let's advance some months (10), we had a baby. She is the reason that i'm here typing this now for you guys read it, because if not, it was for me being burned in hell for suicide.   She of couse, hid the pregnancy , tried to abort EVEN WITH ME BEING BY HER SIDE, lied to me about birth control pills yea, but fuck it i was a man and i for sure wouldn't let my daughter be aborted , she then tried to give her for adoption and was all about ""she will trouble us, our life"" and i was about to kick her out from the house get my baby and that's it. My parents started to help me but the damage was made it already and it was about to get worst.  She was my bride and guess what ? Yea, she cheat on me.  I understand that sometimes i was a dick but man i was not up to be a cuck. I went crazy again, but i controled myself, i send her back to her state with 2 K of money from my own (she quited her job with 2 months of pregnancy ) . I was so god damned hurt. Cheat on me with my best friend cliché ? Wow. Then i started to think about it, he had a great body because he almost live in the gym because he didn't work and didn't have a family . But she doing that ? That hurt me a lot more than he doing it. And i was only 20 back there. She find another guy, and seems like I 'm now the aprisioned guy addicted to drugs (like her aunt had telled me ) you know ? I'm so fucking sad. I loved this girl so fucking much , i wish so fucking much to had a life with her, with her daughter, with my daughter. She left and didn't even ask about our daughter. You know how sad this is ?  On the other hand, i'm so frustrated about womans and so sad that every girl that i start to like i dump her because i don't want to delay her life like KIm did to me.  I'm fucking scared of relationships, i'm fucking scared of girls , i'm fucking terrified by the idea of trust anyone else then my father and my mother. i 'm not feeling like a man anymore, i'm feeling like shit. BUT i started to train again in Muay Thai and i'm enjoying it. but i feel so fucking lone because i really do everything alone. My workout, go eat some pizza, walk in a park.. i'm so alone.   Well, i stopped to take drugs to feel better , i stopped with almost everything and started to go to gym and for now that is working, i'm just hope that someday in the future maybe.. Kim would become a nice person and will try to retake all the time that she is losting.

"Struggled with depression and anxiety for 3 years and made it through Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my experiences with depression and anxiety in the hope it might give someone else a reason to keep going. I’m new to reddit, so I hope this is okay!  I’ve struggled with severe depression and anxiety for the past three years and it’s honestly been the most difficult thing I’ve ever dealt with. Mental illness is silently crippling. I’ve spent more nights than I can remember wracked with sobs, feeling incredibly alone, and fantasizing about suicide. I’ve spent more days than I can remember feeling hollow, being apathetic, and not caring about what happened to me.   Depression is a fucking bitch, and even now, when I actually feel happy and loved and excited for my future, I’m not naive enough to think that I’ll never have to struggle with my mental health again. But I think I have learned how to best cope with it. Medication didn’t work for me, and while I do believe that professional therapy can be invaluable to people struggling with mental illness, it didn’t make a big difference in my case. But I learned to focus on the present, to rely on loved ones I’m lucky enough to have, and to forgive myself. Take it one small step at a time. So what if you couldn’t leave your room today? That shit’s fucking hard! You got up and you got out of bed, that’s the first step. Learn to love yourself even through the despair and self-loathing.  There is no one path to overcoming depression, and sometimes it’s not exactly the cure-all you envisioned but rather learning to live with it. But I promise you all that one day, it will be better. You will be happy again. And until then, I’m happy to listen to you if you ever need anyone to talk to or have any questions.",1,struggled depression anxiety year hi everyone just wanted share experience depression anxiety hope reason going new reddit hope okay struggled severe depression anxiety past year honestly difficult thing dealt with mental illness silently crippling spent night remember wracked sob feeling incredibly alone fantasizing suicide spent day remember feeling hollow apathetic not caring happened me depression fucking bitch now actually feel happy loved excited future not naive think struggle mental health again think learned best cope it medication did not work me believe professional therapy invaluable people struggling mental illness did not make big difference case learned focus present rely loved one lucky have forgive myself small step time not leave room today shit fucking hard got got bed step learn love despair selfloathing path overcoming depression not exactly cureall envisioned learning live it promise day better happy again then happy listen need talk question
" Yes my first entry! I really like to do this a long time ago when I found out to one of my friends this blogspot thing.... Its cool!! No need to write... If you guys don't know yet, one of my past time is writing to my diary, I have 3 notebooks filled with stuff regarding my life and it is nice to share what’s going on with my life to my friends. I hope you can visit this page everytime. Just to let you know who I really am, and what kind of person I am (its the same thing right!) haha... So everyday I will write my high time and low time... Right now my HIGH TIME: Singing again! It’s been a long time, I love to sing and I’m going to look for a way to join the choir again. That is my passion, but do not ask me to sing in public because it's not my thing to memorize lyrics of the song, but if you will request beforehand I can sing it for you... I also sing in weddings and funerals (joke!), so if you guys need a wedding singer just give me a ring! DOWN TIME: I wasn't able to sleep well I do not know why,,, maybe because there is a lot of things going on with my mind, my work, friends and family... work because I don't know yet if I will resign or not.... it's a question and you know how hard it is to look for a high paying job so I'm still thinking it over and over and over again!!! I just hope I will find an answer this week... Friends yes I love all my friends but I miss some of them specially my PREX family, we don't have time to bond anymore because of my schedule, I really miss them and I will try to make it up to you guys!

" After much encouragement from my tech-savvy boyfriend, I’ve decided to get on board with the concept of blogging. As a writer, it only makes sense that I find an outlet to document my thoughts. However, I still kinda feel like Doogie Houser at the end of an episode when he would type a couple of sentences on his old school computer to both sum up his day and offer some sort of introspective look at the universe. Remember how he would always pause right before the last few words? That lame theme music would play as he contemplated the perfect vocabulary to capture the essence of his experience. And then he would always type the last couple of words r-e-a-l-l-y s-l-o-w-l-y. I guess that was a primitive form of blogging.   I still find the concept of putting your thoughts out for the world to read intimidating and intriguing. I mean, why would anyone care what I had for breakfast or thought of a movie I had recently seen? I guess it’s just like having a diary, but how personal can a blog get if you know everyone can read it? Regardless, I feel that writing for leisure again instead of just for work will be a positive experience for me.

"this is my first post.  I am 27, 5 and a half months pregnant dealing with depression / anxiety.  I have taken antidepressants off and on for a few years but stopped this summer because my husband and I were trying to conceive.  My pregnancy has been pretty rough this time around ... (I have an 8 year old son).  I've had joint problems, severe morning sickness ... and terrible depression / anxiety.  My husband just doesn't understand what I'm going through ... he thinks that I'm being hateful or sad on purpose.  He contributes to a lot of the way that I feel.  He told me early in the pregnancy, that if something was to happen and I lose the baby or it was born with something wrong with it, he would have a hard time not blaming me for it even if the doctor said that nothing could have prevented it.  This was said to me because I wasn't taking my prenatal vitamins at the time because of the morning sickness.  I could see if I were using drugs or drinking but I do not do those things.  I don't understand his thinking on that subject.  My mother in law is another person getting on my nerves.  She comes over uninvited and gives out unwanted advice.  She also has a way of making me angry with her thoughtless comments which are hurtful and unnecessary.  I can't talk to my husband about this because he would see me as the ""bad guy"".  Sometimes I just want to be alone ... away from people ... I feel like I don't have any privacy anymore.  My husband always makes me feel worse when I talk to him about how I feel.  I don't know why he aggravates me to talk to him then always says .... ""Well, you ought to be thankful ... rrblah rrblah rrblah"".  It isn't like I don't know that I could have it worse ... but he never cares what I feel at that moment.  I guess I better shut up ... I have ranted long enough ... although I feel like I could go on forever ... so sorry for the long post ...

I got laid off but my coworker that stole $1000 didn't. I was a new sales person at a dealership. I was very sick and went into work. My boss dismissed me because I sick and told me not to come back until I was better.  Later today I got laid off because I didn't text him that I was sick the day after. Which I thought we established that I can't come back to work until I felt better.  Meanwhile the financial manager stole $1000 and the boss didn't fire him.

"Hi everyone. I am here because I am very depressed due to uncontrollable situations of extreme stress this year and a lifetime of stupid choices that have led me to where I am today: lonely and sad. I talked to my primary dr. and now have been taking Zoloft for almost 2 months. It seems to help some, I don't feel like I will panic to the point of losing control completely. And I am seeking help, I don't have a therapist yet, but I checked with my insurance and wrote some names down, now I have to pick up the phone and speak into the receiver and set an appointment. My plan is to do this on Monday. I like to be supportive of others, so although I do sound gloomy, I hope to meet others who are making progress and maybe be of help to you, too. I will post more later I feel the need to sleep. I have trouble with sleep and nightmares and eating, lately I have to force myself to eat, I have a weird aversion to food, I start to feel sick & queasy when I try to eat. But life in general makes me sick and queasy. I am alone for the Holidays which suits me just fine. I wish I could go to the ""Island of misfit people"" and stay there and never leave.

Honestly every single day for the past 5 years I have debated killing myself, I tried a few times but I was unsuccessful. Really I was down in a hole, couldn’t seem to find an escape. My parents tried their best but were at a loss.  Finally, I met A [18 M] last september and we started dating in July. And he has been the most supportive person i have ever met, would take days off of work to take care of me when I was too sad, would help me talk through things, told me why he loved me and that the flaws didn’t matter to him. He is the absolute best and I haven’t even thought about suicide for the past three months.  It gets better, I was really lost, was hoping i would die and I found my cure.

I am concerned about privacy and having trouble getting insured in the future with mental health issues on my record, but paying out of pocket is not a great option either as I'm currently a broke college student.

We were gym partners, helped other out with assignments, and hanged out so frequently. That was all until he got a girlfriend.  He met with this chick like 5 months ago and i was pleased for the dude, he seemed happy. 5 months on he still seems so attached to his girl, he rarey texts me and we used to play xbox together but none of those happen anymore. On the rare occasion when we do go to hang out he is always on his phone texting his girl, infact even in the cinema we watched a movie he was literally texting her during the film... even on xbox i hear the phone go off every minute or so  We done so much shit together.... i gave him a driving instructor with a family discount cos i knew the guy and he got his license now, i helped him raise $600 for a new pc, and even went into a lil business together where i invested and he knew the contacts.  This dude was my brother basiclly and now he never has time for me, we were so damn close and i wish things could go back to how they were without this girl because she is so paranoid of him talking to another girl  I dont get why he has done this to me, ive always been there for him and now he doesnt even respond to my messages, i see him active on facebook but doesnt even read messages... i helped this dude out so much in high school he was going to fail, i taught him some shit and thats how we got close and he passed literally because of me.

"I just told all 100 students I teach I have depression in an email about finals week I'm an undergraduate TA at a university, in an interdisciplinary class about the brain. I absolutely love being a TA, but admittedly this quarter it has been a struggle mentally, I often feel anxious that I am doing a horrible job.  I sent out this email to all 100 of my students about finals:  Hi everyone,  These next two weeks will be a really, really tough time for all of you. I know how incredibly hard you all have worked this quarter, and how hard you will push yourselves during this final stretch, but there are 2 other things I want you to know:  1) I, the other TAs, and our professor will not be disappointed if you do not perform as well you want, so you shouldn't be either. Tests and grades are not always the best reflection of you as students/scientists, and they are most certainly are not a reflection of your worth as a person. All a test assesses is how much content you remember and how well you can take a test at a certain time on a certain day. It is simply one data point, and as you should all know by now, 1 data point is not representative of the population. For many of you, you have other finals/presentations/responsibilities going on, and it'll be difficult to find time to study. For others, you may want so badly to study a lot, but can't because you are so stressed and anxious. I personally deal with anxiety and depression, and I know how utterly frustrating it is when your mind doesn't work as well as you want it to.   2) Take care of yourself. Eat good food, get some sleep, spend time with people you love.   So, while you prepare for finals these next weeks, keep these two things in mind. You are all incredibly curious, kind, intelligent and important people. I brag all the time that I get to work with the most amazing group of students who bring unique and valuable contributions to this class everyday, and inspire me to be the best TA I can possibly be.  Cheering you on!! ~austen1996  (I can't believe I just told all my students about my mental illness, but it honestly feels so liberating to do so. It also feels so hypocritical of me to send this, because I attribute much of my self-worth to academics and don't practice much self-care.....but I felt like this needed to be said).

"Abusive dad or I'm just toxic... Two weeks ago, my dad lost our dog. It went to the shelter but due to the microchip ownership issue, we have to wait two weeks to get her. I told my family that there's a chance that we might not get the dog back.    My dad then started saying how it's fate that the dog is gone and that if we can't get it back then it's destiny. I got annoyed and said ""But really, it's because you weren't being careful and you left her at the park"". He then started yelling at me. Saying he's the only one who walks the dog. I then said I walk the dogs as well, I just don't do it enough because I'm the only one in the family who works from morning to night, paying for the bills, groceries and everything.    He then claimed that it's not his fault and then started saying how if someone told him to look after their child and he accidently killed it, would it be his fault. I responded with yes, it is your fault because it's under your duty of care. Anyway, things got ugly from there.    I didn't speak to him for a week. He got my sister to ask me to pay for his bills and fines. I paid for the $500 one today this morning. Then he asked to borrow my car, and I lent it to him. After that, he came back and started throwing passive jabs at me by talking to the dog.   e.g. ""Bailey, you're lucky that I'm here. If i wasn't here, you would've died a long time ago. Some people just know how to talk and don't do shit.""   I got annoyed and said you lost the dog. Get over it. He then yelled at me. I got annoyed and told him to fuck off. He then started saying ""wow, you're being so disrespectful. God will punish you. I wish you die and I wish you'll live out your life alone.""   I then said ""You came home and started a fight for no reason. Don't play the victim when I argue back"".   He then said ""I'm just talking to myself. You don't have to listen to me.""  I then said ""Go talk to the wall then."" I shut the door and continue with my business.  He then walked next to my door and started going on and on about how I'll die soon for being disrespectful and that god will send a lightning bolt to hit me. I then angrily snapped at him saying ""I may or may not die before you, but I can bet that if you die, no one in this fucking world would mourn for you"".  I then shut the door, and I didn't hear anything from him again.    Not sure if I have a abusive father or I'm just toxic or maybe it's both. I don't want to live like this anymore.

Well I work as an IT Manager/Project Manager so I thought I'd just hit MONSTER and DICE and bingo, the job offers would roll in!  WRONG!  After applying to over 30 job postings I haven't had a single reply of interest.  Ok so the first thing I did was get introspective.  Is it me?  Am I not employable in the year 2004?  Then I thought it was my resume, so I had a professional help me out with that.  He polished it to a fine sheen and I resubmitted it to DICE and MONSTER.  Guess what!!  STILL no hits!  I spoke to a recruiter in Florida who has assured me that I will NOT get any hits because I do not live in Florida!  WHAT!  I'm not even asking for relocation fees!  My wifes job has that covered.

My life was lifting; setting goals, reaching targets, smashing PBs...all helped with creating a future for myself.  I started to feel unwell around December 2016 and developed a persistent, non-productive cough. Series of tests led me to an echocardiograph where it was discovered I was suffering Heart Failure. Dilated Cardio Myopathy caused by a viral infection, left my hearts function at 20%EF.  Apparently I had a few months to live if I hadn't caught it. Ironically, now, I wish they hadn't discovered it. My world flipped upside down. No Powerlifting, no excessive exercise, restricted fluid intake, no over exertion, meds for the rest of my life, regular reviews in my heart clinic, multiple ambulance emergency rides to A&amp;E when my heart goes irregular. Hospital, pharmacy, hospital, pharmacy... Seems to be my life for the past year.  Last Monday I snapped. It hit me. Everything I lost came crashing in on me. I got in my car, picked a place I knew well to ram my car into at 120mph. I was screaming at myself to do it. My left hand steering towards the end, my right hand steering me to survive. An image of my dog in my mind kept me on the road. I knew she'd miss me too much.  I'm still very low now despite all my meds. I still wish I had gone through with it. I still think of going to the Cliffs of Moher and jumping... What a beautiful place to end it. I'm dreading the road ahead because I know how Rocky it's going to be...

" The first week of school was alright (other than the fact i've accidently hurt myself 5 out of 7 days! ) Clumsy me! It's now Tuesday and i have geometry homework that I do not want to do. I'd rather sit here and draw, listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers. I'm kind of mad because I found out that I'm not in govenor honors this year for art because I'm not able to take 1st semester art class due to me failing 1st semester biology last year and I have to take it again. i hope that made sense. Being a small sophmore really sucks because then i feel like people think I'm a freshman and being in biology again doesn't help. I can't wait til I get this school year over with.

"Aha! moment during therapy So I've been meeting with a therapist about once a week since October of 2017. It's been really great, and has helped pull me from the brink more than once.   Background: I'm gay, and was raised Catholic in the 90s. Guess what happened next!   Spoiler: I was bullied mercilessly. If I wasn't too gay, I was too fat, or too tall, or too weird or too unpopular. You get the gist. It it wasn't my hair, it was my mannerisms; if it wasn't my high voice, it was the dark circles under my eyes. (Gee, what could have caused me to be losing sleep?)  Flash forward to today:  My therapist guided me through a meditation today that instructed me to visualize and speak to a younger version of myself. I described what I looked like, what characteristics defined me, and how I saw myself. Then I was instructed to, as myself as the adult I've become, speak to that child and tell him what I was feeling.   I spoke with kindness and compassion and love and respect for that child, and told him everything would be alright. I told him that all of that hatred was wrong, that it was incorrect and that those people who say all those nasty hurtful things, they probably aren't even going to remember saying it, so don't waste your time holding onto it.   And it got me thinking about all of the baggage I've he'd onto my life. All the glances and side comments and nasty, hateful things. And how I've internalized it, and believed it.   And that's when the Aha! moment came.   *All this time, I've been so worried about all the bullying that other people did, I wasn't even thinking about all the bullying I did to myself.* https://media.giphy.com/media/12KiGLydHEdak8/giphy.gif  All this time, *it was me.* Sure, it was other people who planted those seeds, but it was me who perpetuated it, who told myself that they were true. After all, if you say something enough, it might as well be as true as anything else.   So there it is. There's one step. It might just be one step, but it's a step in the right direction. There's my holy shit moment of the day, and I just wanted to share with you all. There is hope. There is progress. There is love. And I hope you all are able to find it.

" ""When exactly do we go from being kids to being just people, I'm not sure. I do know that it's not about turning a certain age or graduating from school.

"The one upside of being depressed I've recently noticed something that has, strangely enough, somehow helped me a bit with my depression.  See, I've started not ""sweating the small stuff."" For example; stuck in traffic? It's okay. Spilled my coffee? Oh, well. My co-worker is annoying? Doesn't phase me.  My thought process is like this: when I wake up and feel like dying, at least the spilled coffee gives me something to do in the mean time. Or standing in a queue forces me to be more in the present and not as much in my head. Since I came to realise this, I've noticed an increase in my general mood, or at least I've become better at coping with going outside, shopping etc.",1,upside depressed recently noticed ha strangely enough helped bit depression see started not sweating small stuff example stuck traffic okay spilled coffee oh well coworker annoying doe not phase me thought process like this wake feel like dying spilled coffee give mean time standing queue force present not head came realise this noticed increase general mood better coping going outside shopping etc

"I can really relate to what a lot of you have said, in being embarrassed about seeking help. Being a teenager I don't have really have the ability to seek help on my own, and there is no way that I'm going to tell my parents. I tried hinting at it - telling them I didn't care about stuff, that I hated being around people. I even tried making it completely obvious in giving up or ignoring things I'm usually interested in, such as getting my driver's license (I'm 16, I'll get it soon). Unfortunately, she's a complete idiot and just passes everything off as being normal, somehow. Hell, once I told her flat out that I thought that 'life sucks,' and she still didn't get it!

" Apr. 22nd Sorry for disappearing for a whole month! The journey was great, you can easily tell from the pictures i added in my album. Now i'm back, fully recharged from this long pleasant break!  Maybe it's a rhythm i adopted from the repeating semester-vacation-semester pattern over time, emptiness usually creeps on me when i've been too long away from my school work (good or bad?). Now getting back to what i was doing feels super-good (don't give me the diagnosis of workaholic^^), especially with the freshness of the long sleep nights still left in my brain.  Mar 11th, I got a new camera!!^o^ The days were so hard when the great sceneries are lying there and you just cannot take them home. You won't wait long to see the best sights in Bangor!! :-)  It's now tow weeks away from easter vacation. I'm already counting the days! guess it's the same for those of  you who are in UK^^ what are you guys planning to do for this long spring break? I'm going on a trip to Scotland and fly from Edinburgh to Netherlands (again^^).  Engjoy the warmth of early spring! I'm sure you will all make the best out of your time!   Feb 29th, after over one week's  construction, this page is roughly finished. It's my first attempt to build a homepage. With the foolproof tools from Yahoo, things seem to go on well^^  Spring still feels afar, It snowed for two days, leaving Bangor covered with pure white. The land shines brightly under the sun, and the colour of sky turned from the dead grey to a clear blue, with just enough trouches of clouds. It would be a perfect sunday if i don't have to sit indoor and work out my statistics assignment...    Feb 21st, I started building this page...  Since one and half years ago, my life started to float and i've been moving from one place to another. The new places fed my curiosity and brought freshness into my life. Yet friends come and go, it's indeed too hard to keep close friends close when we are all busy moving on in our lives.  It's not until recently, when i was talking with an old friend, did i realized how little i have been sharing my life with my friends. Let this page be an encouraging start.

"Religious difference between you and your child? Hi everyone! I am a doctoral student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and am conducting a research study on the experience of religious difference between parents and children. This experience is one that can be challenging and I hope to understand how parents make sense of it and ideally wish they could communicate about it.   Participation will take approximately 30 minutes. If you are interested you can access the online survey at this link: https://ssp.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9GIVZe29RWXXe0l  There is minimal risk of emotional and/or psychological discomfort because the survey will ask you questions about your religious difference with your child. You may leave the survey at any time if you do not wish to complete it.   If you have any questions, please let me know. You may reach me at toni.morgan@huskers.unl.edu. Thank you for your time!

"Was it wrong to block my dad's phone? Was it wrong of me to block my dad? We had a massive fight that just escalated quickly, as we always do. My dad has a habit to threaten to disown me every time he gets angry. Once I pointed out how hurtful it was, and asked him to please not to say that, but nothing changed. So I’m just trying not to respond to these angry text messages about how he wanted me to stop using their address because we are not family anymore. 20 minutes later he sends another message telling me to do as he says or he will embarrass me in an extended family group chat (he doesn’t know that it doesn’t bother me and he eventually carries out this threat later), and then 20 minutes later he offers me a deal where he would drop this address issue if I do a couple of things that he wanted. Sorry for being vague, the things he wanted were the things I essentially didn’t want to do and is linked to what we had an argument about. From my perspective, I saw messages that were intentionally hurtful, about how I wasn’t family, and then I saw a threat to shame me, and then I saw what looks like a way to manipulate or coerce me into doing what he wanted. It was very late at night and I had work the next day. That was the point I blocked his number (and I told him before I blocked it) and it is the first time ever in all 30 years of my life. However, now I’m wondering if it was the right thing to do, because well, Asian parents always say shit like that and don’t mean it, and I think my very drastic step would have upset both my parents a lot. An imposed silence also sabotages the opportunity for future open communication and is quite passive aggressive as well. If they were overreacting about the disowning me part, then I could have angered them to the point where they decide to go through with it.  The next two days I unblocked my dad and sent some messages about how I was sorry I had to block my dad and clarified some of the things they were unhappy about (some of what they were unhappy about wasn't at all true). But I think both my parents have now blocked my number. Yet I can't blame them for doing that because I did it to them first, but I do wish I had just turned off my mobile, or been able to bear the burden of hearing shitty talk, instead of blocking my dad. (It's not possible to visit them as we live in different countries).    Prior to this fight, I have been working through ‘abandonment’ issues with a therapist. Not hard to understand why… my dad always says things like ‘don’t call me dad’ and ‘don’t come home’, ‘don’t need a daughter like that’ if I don’t do what he says for as long as I can remember. My parents don't know this. I’ve thought about completely cutting my dad out of my life, but I’m undecided as I feel like other people who have done it have more serious issues like abuse, violence, lying, and more about conflicts on serious issues like marriage, religion, sexual identity and child custody.  Would really appreciate some 'Asian' perspective here, as most of my friends don't fully understand the cultural aspect of this.

It’s so unfair, if I had thought this through maybe she wouldn’t be in this position. Im so close to graduation but so fucking scared. What if I don’t get a job right away?

"Falling for someone you have no chance to be with Warning: Super long read  Have you ever fallen for someone that you know you have absolutely no chance with?  It’s been 4 years since I’ve fallen for a girl back in college, which ended up in heartbreak and depression because she already found someone else. I’ve lost all motivations and my passion for arts (I’m an art student), failed my thesis which sent me into another dark place, ’friends’ were not even there to help me get up, and for the remaining years I had in college, the thing that kept me going are my parents, I just wanted to survive for them. I’ve lost all emotions, the flame that was once burning in my heart, the excitement I had when I was a freshman. I graduated college 7 months ago and found work not related to the course I took up, it felt really low, but I just wanted to survive. Training for work now, didn’t want to make friends again, had one, but he didn’t liked the people so he left in a few weeks, the only thing in my mind was to focus and be better for this job to survive. Avoided lunch and hanging out with workmates, and didn’t really reveal much about myself aside from having a mundane life. The trainers were aware of my introversion and decided to have random sitting arrangements every week so we could get to know our workmates more, and I could get to talk about other stuff aside from work. 3 weeks in training and still, I didn’t made any connections, I only help out my workmates professionally, point out mistakes and the next step they should take.  I get to be sit mates with the liveliest girl in training, playful and have a contagious ’happy’ aura(?). There were also a few talks and laughs about work related stuff, but I didn’t really made efforts to start it, she was always the one that engages first (and that’s because she’s an extrovert and does this to everyone anyways). Being around her, hearing her voice, seeing her smile felt something, it felt like the flame that I lost 4 years ago came back. But, what made me fell the most is that she’s intelligent as well and speaks in English flawlessly (I live in a country outside US). I can also relate to her because she suffers from clinical depression and requires therapy sessions every now and then (everyone in training knows this anyways because she told the class from the get-go). I didn’t really asked her out for lunch or coffee, I really wanted to so I could get to know her better and be friends with her, be her guide in her darkest days, but my introversion and over thinking always gets the best of me.  There were only a few times she joined me and my friend during a coffee break where I found out a few things about her. There were times that I see the sadness beyond her smile, and times where her depression was clearly visible and affected me greatly. I always think about scenarios - if the conditions were right - where I get to talk with her and lend a helping hand, at the end of the day they only remain as thoughts. I know she doesn’t think about me like how I think about her. Every time our shift ends, I leave the office quickly and ignore the feelings I have for her, my mind is at a constant battle on whether or not to ask her for lunch, ask her if she’s ok. It’s even worse at night, whenever I see her late night tweets about her depression, a part of me just wants to be there for her, and the other part gives me the realization of how pathetic I am and that I don’t deserve her. I know that she had an ex-bf that broke her heart, and currently has a gf (she’s bi). Yet, she still gives me inspiration in every photo I take. I really don’t know what is wrong with me, I’m being tormented by my own mind and I still like it. Knowing that she already has someone in her heart, yet still seeing her depressed at times (and looking at her tweets), really makes me want to step up and do something, but held back by my own tormented soul.  Next week would be the last week in training, after that we’re going to get split up into teams and do actual work, but still go back to class to share our experience and reflect upon them. One could only hope for a miracle that I gain the strength and courage to talk to her more and be a part of her life. I really hate this feeling, yet this pain fuels my passion even more.",1,falling chance warning super long read fallen know absolutely chance with year fallen girl college ended heartbreak depression else lost motivation passion art i art student failed thesis sent dark place friend not help up remaining year college thing kept going parent just wanted survive them lost emotion flame burning heart excitement freshman graduated college month ago work not related course took up felt really low just wanted survive training work now did not want make friend again one did not liked people left week thing mind focus better job survive avoided lunch hanging workmate did not really reveal aside having mundane life trainer aware introversion decided random sitting arrangement week know workmate more talk stuff aside work week training still did not connection help workmate professionally point mistake step take sit mate liveliest girl training playful contagious happy aura talk laugh work related stuff did not really effort start it engages and extrovert doe anyways her hearing voice seeing smile felt something felt like flame lost year ago came back but fell intelligent speaks english flawlessly i live country outside u relate suffers clinical depression requires therapy session everyone training know anyways told class getgo did not really asked lunch coffee really wanted know better friend her guide darkest day introversion thinking get best me time joined friend coffee break thing her time sadness smile time depression clearly visible affected greatly think scenario condition right talk lend helping hand end day remain thought know doe not think like think her time shift end leave office quickly ignore feeling her mind constant battle not ask lunch ask ok worse night late night tweet depression just want her give realization pathetic not deserve her know exbf broke heart currently gf she bi yet give inspiration photo take really not know wrong me tormented mind like it knowing heart seeing depressed time and looking tweet really make want step something held tormented soul week week training going split team actual work class share experience reflect them hope miracle gain strength courage talk life really hate feeling pain fuel passion more

"Ok, so i've had depression for at least 4 years and it has gotten a lot worse the past two. My mom tried shoving prozac down my throat and swore that it helped me, but it didn't. I didn't talk to a counselor until about a month a go.  I was going to school and every time i went to main campus i would get Ds and Fs. I would start out ok but then end up sleeping more and more. This past quarter i physically could not get out of bed at one point. My parents just saw it as me blowing my last chance at college and took it as i didn't care. It seems like i don't feel anymore. I do care that i blew my last chance at college and i finally decided to see a counselor 3 weeks before the end of the quarter. My parents said the only reason i did that is because i knew i was in trouble and just needed an excuse. I don't know why i don't do the things i know i should be doing. I just feel like i can't. My parents say it's all my fault, that i don't take responsibility for anything and I just want to blame everything on something else. Which isn't the case. They don't think that depression has anything to do with not trying, that it doesn't affect rational decision making. I'm starting to think it doesn't either. I mean, why can't i do the things i know I'm suppose to do? The things that will better my life. The things that will make my parents proud? Is it the depression or am I truly lazy and just don't care???

"I'm a hetero man, 35, divorced, no kids. I can honestly say that I feel empathy towards any guy who suffers from depression. Some of my closest guy friends have admitted to me their many bouts of battling these demons, just as I've shared my horror stories and near suicidal incidents, and we all have empathy with each other over that stuff. I'm beginning to not give a crap anymore about depression being viewed as just a ""woman"" issue; it is what it is and to heck with gender stereotypes. The things I've noticed the most are my friends' unwillingness to consult a therapist or take medication, but perhaps their bouts of depression are not the ""bed-ridden"" variety that I have gone through. Or maybe this is their way of not feeling ""completely weak"". Most of my friends will either drink excessively or take drugs to deal with this stuff. I tried to drink it all away, but in the end it just made me feel worse. I tried tranquilizers, but that didn't work. I tried booze and pills together, but still the depression lingered. Now I just smoke cigarettes and go running (what a dichotomy, I know) but whatever works, right?

"How should I deal with this flaky friend? I have a friend who I totally love who ALWAYS flakes. whether the plans are big or small 95% of the plans we make (initiated by her often) end up with ""I don't feel like going out"" or ""i made other plans"" or ""i don't remember making these plans"" etc. This is super annoying and all but it's not the whole problem.  Since she's super flaky I always call her out on it or joke about it. for example: In our group chat another friend will make plans and she'll be like ""ok its set"" and then i'll reply like ""that only means it's half set"" and I know I'm being snarky and all but she deserves it for being such a flake! right?

"I have really been trying to 'control' my rage while driving. Since being medicated it's not as bad, but I can't stop. Today this guy chased me, forced me to pull over and started yelling, I thought he would hit me. I was surprisingly calm, not even afraid. I guess I just didn't care what happened to me at that point I hate when I get so angry, go into road rage mode, because I feel like crap afterwards, I don't like myself, I usually cry. I can't talk to my husband especially about this. I feel very isolated. All he does is get mad, lecture me, tell me to stop, don't you know it's dangerous, etc. He judges and blames me. He has no idea how I feel and I doubt he ever will. I feel better now that I can come here and talk to people who will understand my feelings (even if what I did is wrong, I hope???). It's very easy to say you'll change, you'll calm down. Easier said than done. I feel like I have to hide the fact that I'm in this forum from my husband, I have to hide a lot from him.

"Now this stupid posting thing is screwed up - I can't do anything right      Got the old depressed suicide bug again.      It's funny because last night i read some articles I had written  regarding death and suicide, many about saving other depressed persons from killing themselves, recognizing the pain that the survivors go through, and not wanting it to happen to my family. And then the thought rears its ugly head, it would be so easy to let myself go, go into that peaceful night, waiting until my mom dies first (soon - natural causes) and then doing it. Because I am a failure, I can't do anything else but fail at my job. I used to write in a cave type place - a place where my writings would be secure and it's going away. That's how come I looked at my writings.      I had told my therapist that it seems sometimes I feel angry and selfish and that's one of the triggers that trigger the thoughts of suicide. I have run out of visits covered by insurance I could pay for more but there is no need for visits - I've almost stopped talking. I feel like going home, crawling up on my bed with the teddy bear my husband hates and crying. At the cave web site, the others don't like to hear about suicide so I've stopped writing there (it's another site for depression type people - no one goes there now). I keep talking about death and suicide to my husband and my kid - and I feel guilty but the words and my thoughts are obsessed with death. I can make the decisions about my mom and my kid, but this halfway limbo concerning my states sucks.       I guess this is just venting. My mom has at least another week to live ....

I was pleasantly surprised with how well it went.  Now we just have to try it at the church with amplification.  Scary!!  It is mildy terrifying as I haven't sung in public for approx. 11 years.  I figure if I just close my eyes I'll be okay.  I am really dreading the whole weekend.  We have the rehearsal on Thursday night, rehearsal for a wedding my son is in at 3pm on Friday, Dad's wedding at 6:30pm Friday night, than the other wedding at 1pm on Saturday.  I won't have a minutes breathing space until Sunday, on which we are invited to my nephews birthday party.  Bleah!!!!  And sometime in there, B has to fix his bosses car that is apart in our garage.

" Howdy everyone,     I guess I have to find a way to write in this a bit more and keep things up to date however that is somthing I am not always good about. Now that summer is here maybe if there is any exciting news I will post some info and see what is going on in my life.    So now that school is done and I have one course down and I have been to Burlington and back I now enter July.  THe month of unchartered waters. Who knows what this month will bring for me.  I am sure I will have many adventures but at the same time I am sure I will be busy with all the free time I have to deal with.  Today I finished one of my first summer craft projects. I redid my fun chair.  Oh it was so much fun and now I have a very nice light green sponge painted chair.  I think I should just go into home decorating and photography.  I guess maybe if nothing else I will use this as a gauge of what I get done this summer.  Well I hope to get my puzzel I got started and done. I am working on ideas for my classroom. I get to work on bulletin board and decorating ideas. Oh the fun that is present in a summer off.    The 4th of July is here.. I think back to the two times I have not been in the US to celebrate the 4th. One year I was in Paris France at the Hard Rock Cafe and then 2nd time was this last year when I went to Australia for the Summer.  The 4th was the last day we spent in Port Douglass. We went out to Hog's Breath Cafe and had a blast with the bus driver.  OH the memories of July 4th past.  I also recall the year I went to my friends house and we had a hudge water fight and I got water dumped over my head.. Yeah many memories and I am sure more to be created yet this year.

"Trying to make me jealous I once asked some friends about where they get one of their ""items"" and they both seemed to shrug it off, laugh and basically show that they don't want me to know. I thought wow ok didn't expect it from friends but I guess some people are petty about some things. And they knew that it got to me a little that they didn't tell me but whatever. Now they would bring up the topic of this ""item"" here and there knowing how they treated me regarding it. I have strong suspicions they are doing it to spite me or prod me to give a reaction or just to reinforce their ""dominant"" position. They probably get a kick out of it. The problem is, I don't know the best way to react to it when it's brought up in convo to show that I'm not envious or jealous.

My SO has panic disorder and it’s making me depressed. My SO has been diagnosed for now with panic disorder (waiting on health monitor results to check to see if it’s not something else)  The last couple of months have been really hard. He has overtime gotten more worried about his health and every time is convinced that it’s cancer or something else deadly.   He can spend hours on google about a discomfort he feels and freaks out because webmd says it one thing and another site says something else. He checks his heart rate every 15 minutes because he downloaded an app on his phone.   I have taken him to the er multiple times in the past couple of months and each time they say that’s nothing is wrong he’s just having bad panic attacks. He won’t believe them because then he’ll go on reddit and see stories of people being misdiagnosed. I’m convinced he’s a hypochondriac.  We can’t go about one day without him saying he doesn’t feel good. It’s hard to enjoy myself whenever we go out because I’m just waiting for him to say something about not feeling good so we can just leave wherever we’re at.  I don’t know how to fully support him through this.  When he freaks out and wants to call the ambulance I don’t know if I should let him knowing that they’re just gonna say he’s fine or tell him that it’s in his head and make him feel like I’m not taking him seriously.  I feel bad for feeling this way. But it’s making me depressed.

"OPINIONS PLEASE/SISTER ISSUE I’m a 43 year old single mom of a 21 year old son. I suffer from major depressive disorder, ocd, ptsd and anxiety. I work part time and live with my mother. I’ve had issues since I was a child. So I believe my sister and I can be jealous of each other. Her of me because I’ve had issues and me of her because she’s normal.  Our father passed away 4 years ago. Which was a devastating loss for all of us. I have lived and raised my son with my parents for the last 12 years or so.  My sister moved away about 12 years ago and got married had two kids got divorced, had another kid and recently got married. She is a busy mother of 3 and working full time. After my dad passed my mother and I decided to move closer to my sister and her family.  I admit I have issues and my sister is the type that I feel truly doesn’t “believe” in my issues. She sees me as lazy, crazy, etc. I see her roll her eyes when she thinks I’m being too much. She never asks me to help her out I guess because of my issues. I moved here to be closer to her and I feel abandoned. She has no time for me. We are building a house together, my mom and I have an inlaw suite and my sister and her family have the main house. My mother has given them the money to put a down payment on this home. At times I am pissed especially when she throws in my face that there are certain things that I want in the building of the house that are going to cost extra. She is a hard core bitch at times. She hardly shows any love. Her job has her so tied up that she doesn’t take care of herself, sometimes puts off taking her kids to the dr, she has no time to go out with us. She can’t even take time to respond to any of my texts during the day.  She makes fun of me in indirect ways, “I didn’t really mean it” when I have a memory issue (from depression treatments). But when I respond with FU it isn’t quite so funny anymore and she’s done with me. My mom is so torn she hates that we feel this way towards each other. My mom has been there for us both thru thick and thin, financially and emotionally. I just want a sister, someone who’s going to have my back once my mom is gone. I have no one else. Help me, Am I just jealous of her? How do I fix this?

" A letter of complain  Dear Ms Tang, I really must have to complain about the summer camp that organized by your company. I was one of the first students from my school to go to this camp. Expecting a relaxing camp, the camp was totally a disaster! There were many problems in the camp, such as there were holes on the tents, all the sport equipment was broken, foods were horrible and a very dirty beach.  On the first night of the camp, it rained. So we decided to stay in the tent to play some card games. However, there were holes on the tents! The rain dropped through the holes and made us all wet. Also, it made us unable to sleep and even so, some of my classmates had caught a cough after that night.  Finally the rain had stopped on the next day, therefore we all got out and wanted to enjoy some sports activities. When we got to the sport equitmenp room, we found that all the things were broken. We couldn't play football because the football had a hole and so do the basketball. We also couldn't play the tennis because we couldn't find the tennis ball. All the things there were like a mass and made the room just like a rubbish room. At that day, we did nothing until noon and all of us were bored.  Hoping for a delicious lunch, the food was awful. The food was badly cooked. For example the fish had bad smell and seemed that it had been cooked a long time ago. The soup was the most horrible dish. The color of the soup was black! We didn't want to eat them, but we were all hungery and there were no restaurants nearby, we had to eat them. In the afternoon, many of us felt sick and had a stomach-ache.   The advertisement of this camp said that there would be a beautiful beach near the camp site for us to swim. However, the beach was terrible too. The beach was full of cans, glass bottles, paper and so do the see. We all disappointed about the camp and we all thought that this was the worst camp that we even had.  I was totally not satisfied by the services that provided by your company and we are claiming the total cost that we spent on the camp which is totally five thousands six hundred dollars. If you don't give us the refund, we will take further action by sending complain to the consumer Council.  I'm looking forward to receiving your prompt reply.  Yours faithfully, K. Ng. K. Ng.

I really only have one hobby that I have feel attachment to,  and frankly, I dont enjoy most new shows.

And whenever I do those things, except for my one main hobby sometimes, I feel that I am all to aware that it's just escapism, and instead of escaping, I fall back into the same track. I don't  think I have a short attention span, but that's what I always feel like I go back to in the back of my head, as that's what people my age are supposed to have because of this digital age.",1,dont understand people interested thing first let apologize formatting issue typing mobile generally television boring little netflix show anime video game hobby really hobby feel attachment to frankly dont enjoy new show watch own typically watched younger like scooby doo phineas ferb main one absolute favorite youth rare is thing main hobby sometimes feel aware just escapism instead escaping fall track not think short attention span feel like head people age supposed digital age

"im lost without her but I don't know what to do So me and my best friend of about 7 years stopped talking and being friends essentially, around a year ago. We had been fighting a bit before and it kind of led up to this.  So what kind of started it off was the fact she got a new boyfriend who was and I swear still is, the biggest jerk of all time. I can see now that it probably wasn't my place to tell her that but I was only looking out for her and she used to appreciate advice like that from me in the past.   Then she started pretty much ditching me for him and taking his side and telling him things that were private and I felt like she was slowly kicking me out and replacing me. And I told her that, but she didn't see it because she had her new guy and it was kind of like she didn't care because she had someone there for her.  She also lost a couple other friends before this happened pretty much due to the same reasons so I didn't feel that bad at first because I was kind of like you know ""she did this to herself, she made this choice"". But now, I really miss her and I hate that we stopped being friends because I kind of need her.  Im not sure what to do. She did actually text me about a month after we stopped talking and was like ""hey, I know we don't talk anymore but I wanted to see how you are going"" and I actually ignored it because I was angry and didn't care but now I kind of see it was a bitch move. And I don't know how to text her or talk again because its awkward and she's still with this guy and I'm pretty sure he hates me and I juts don't know how to handle it. But I really want to make this right again.  Any help would be really appreciated :) ",0,im lost not know best friend year stopped talking friend essentially year ago fighting bit kind led this kind started fact got new boyfriend swear is biggest jerk time probably not place tell looking used appreciate advice like past started pretty ditching taking telling thing private felt like slowly kicking replacing me told that did not new guy kind like did not care her lost couple friend happened pretty reason did not feel bad kind like know she did herself choice now really miss hate stopped friend kind need her im not sure do did actually text month stopped talking like hey know not talk anymore wanted going actually ignored angry did not care kind bitch move not know text talk awkward guy pretty sure hate jut not know handle it really want make right again help really appreciated

"I dare you guys to figure this out. So I met rhis girl during fall semester for college. We found out that we went to the same school as each other, but she is a couple of years younger than me so we never really met before until summer. So we started hanging out after class, and a few times on the weekends. She has always had some what of a communication problem and depression problem. However before i knew that there was a tjme where i messaged her and she hadn't responded and a couple of weeks had gone by. I was thinking that I was annoying her. So i told her we shouldn't bftiends anymore. Later finding out that she had communication issues. She literally has like no friends at all which i genuinely believe.

"When I was 10, my babysitter molested me many times over the course of 1 year. Many of the times she would make me dress up in girl's clothes and she would take me out that way. I'm 30 now. I still can't have sex. I still can't go out into public without having severe anxiety attacks. And when I'm at home, I find myself cross dressing sometimes.

"My Daughter turned 30 today.  I called and sent her a card, but she is not speaking to me.  Reason being ... I've helped her and her husband financially for approximately 2  years with the child care payment for my lovely grand daughter (she is 3 years old). I explained to both of them (daughter and her husband), that I'd have to quit paying half the payment (273.00 per month), after I get my 2005 tax return, because I'm planning on buying a new car.  I need a smaller car, and the one I own is from 1995 SUV.  I gave my older car to my nephew in Arizona.  He was driving a 1985 Toyota with no air conditioning.  He is thrilled to recieved my 1995 Passport (Honda), that has many miles, but no serious problems. I was babysitting my lovely granddaughter one Saturday night.  When they came home from a party.  My son in law stunk of weed and he was drunk.  He was hugging his daughter (my granddaughter), while he was stoned and drunk.  I was so disappointed.  I come from the old school that pot is bad. Being that my daughter was promoted to full time, and they both received a total of 2,000.00 tax return, I figure this is a good time to let them know that I'll no longer be paying for half their child care. My daughter blames my decision on the night her husband was very stoned ... I tell her that I can't expect ""the best"" for my granddaughter, when her own father doesn't care, as much as I do.  Plus, I had forewarned her that I'll be buying a car soon.  So ... now I have a new car .. but no daughter, and not granddaughter.  None of them are speaking to me.  I miss my daughter so much, and my granddaughter even more. please advise.

" Hey Im Doug, for those that don't know me Im Raul's brother,for those that don't know Raul,Im a pretty kool kid;thats why I named this blog Kool Kids Blog.   Well since I just Introduced myself, I will you a few thing about myself.   Im fifteen years old and Im going to NDSS(North Delta Senior Secondary) in september.   Can't wait to attend High school, it's going to be so kool But Im still kinda nervous to be a little kid again.   When I was in Junior high I was in grade 10, I thought I was the king of the school;everyone thought I was kool,I had the koolest friends and I had supuriority over the little Grade 8's and 9,s.    But since Im going to   Grade 11 Im going to become inferior to the Grade 12's,not to mention the other Grade 11's.   Basically what Im trying to say is that I will have to make a new image of myself,make new friends,make new enemies.   Most kids in my class barely passed Math10 this school year,I can't imagine how hard Grade 11 math is.   Im going to take Band in Grade 11,I was the best Trumpet player in my school but I know next year Im going to have tough competition, which kinda sucks because I had the worst band teacher this year.   Ms Robinson, the worst band teacher ever;she held me back so much that Im going to have to practice really hard for next year,STUPID TEACHER.   Ms Robinson, tried to teach me and my friends to play guitar even though she DOESNT KNOW HOW TO PLAY GUITAR.   Last year Mrs Lucas left band teacher position,she was the best teacher ever;she let us play good music but then Ms Robinson filled in for her and she made us play crappy music.   My friends hated her too, o-well.   My friends think Im on drugz but I don't know why,I think my lack of sleep might make me look like Im on drugz.

"""You can count on me"" That sweet lie. Maybe this post is a way to vent. Maybe I just need to feel like someone, somwhere has read this and, in a way, I've actually said it.  I don't have many friends, but the ones I do have, I consider them quite close. One of them (let's cal him Joel) is by far the one whom i have a closest relationship with we are bouth 30 right now. I met him as the boyfriend of a workmate about 7 years ago and even after they broke up we stayed as friends.  Joel has a tendency for depression, and I've always tried to help him in any way possible. Because of this problem he ended up hooked on Cocaine, he admited it to me, and we tried everything possible to solve it. So far he seems to be dealing with it reasonably well, but I've had some very rough nights in which i would recieve a text message, wake up at 4 am, grab my keys and drive to his home to literally hold him in my hands while he cried back to sleep and then sand the rest of the night outside his bedroom's door.   Basically, When I say the words ""You can count on me for anything"" I really mean it, and I think I've proved that to him.  Fast forward to last May and, for the first time in many, many years (before i even met him) I was hit with depression myself for various reasons.   It hit me hard, suicide attempt hard.   I tried to deal with it by myself, but finally turned to him and told him what was happening during what I consider the worst night so far in my life. The night I hugged my dog, left him at a friends house ""for a few days because i had to leave the city for work"" and drove to the forest with the intention of not comming back.  In that forest I called Joel in tears, told him whats was happening to me (didnt tell him what i was planning) and he literally said ""I feel bad i can't go there, but I had promissed someone else I havent seen in a while to hang out tonight"" but told me I ""could count on him for whatever I needed"".  To say I was shocked would be an understatement.  Obviously I didnt end my life that day, but I could not believe what had happened. I tried to ignore it, called Joel the very next day and asked him to meet me whenever it was possible.  This was in May.  I would not see Joel's face until September 2nd after basically begging him to meet up.  I'm writing this on November 26, and we have met once since then, a day I had to beg for again in which i planned to tell him how I was dealing with my problem.  He invited a girlfriend he just met and a co-worker to said meeting.  I find myself thinking about this every day, about how a person can be so selfish to have a friend, someone temselves call his best friend, in this situation and proceed to ignore it and basically run away.  After all we have been through this situation is hurting me far more than the reasons that nearly drove me to suicide some months ago.   I want to tell something to everyone who has taken the time to read this.     **Never say ""You can count on me"" if you dont mean it,** you may think you do, but consider if you are actually up to the task. Because,** a failure in this regard can completely crush someone's spirit far more than any problem they needed help with in the first place.**",0,you count me sweet lie maybe post way vent maybe just need feel like someone somwhere read and way actually said it not friend one have consider quite close let cal joel far closest relationship bouth right now met boyfriend workmate year ago broke stayed friend joel tendency depression tried help way possible problem ended hooked cocaine admited me tried possible solve it far dealing reasonably well rough night recieve text message wake am grab key drive home literally hold hand cried sleep sand rest night outside bedroom door basically say word you count anything really mean it think proved him fast forward and time many year before met him hit depression various reason hit hard suicide attempt hard tried deal myself finally turned told happening consider worst night far life night hugged dog left friend house for day leave city work drove forest intention not comming back forest called joel tear told whats happening didnt tell planning literally said i feel bad there promissed havent seen hang tonight told could count needed say shocked understatement obviously didnt end life day not believe happened tried ignore it called joel day asked meet possible may not joel face september nd basically begging meet up writing november met then day beg planned tell dealing problem invited girlfriend just met coworker said meeting thinking day person selfish friend temselves best friend situation proceed ignore basically run away situation hurting far reason nearly drove suicide month ago want tell taken time read this never say you count me dont mean it think do consider actually task because failure regard completely crush spirit far problem needed help place

"How To Get Over The Pain I ended/lost a friendship with a best friend of 14 years. She was really good to me, once upon a time; I was declared disabled and lost my house and she let me move in with her and her husband to get back on my feet. For all she knew I could've been the Thing That Never Leaves. But I lived with her for about 9 months, got a job, and got my own place.  She's Mormon, and during this time had her first kid. She insists everything's fine, no worries (because she had to, I think; Mormons put a lot of pressure on their women.) But things start getting distant between us, and this is only something I notice in hindsight.  I got the greenlight to publish a book, and she offered to typeset because she had InDesign. Okay, are you sure? Yes. You're sure? Yes. Okay, cool, thanks, that's awesome, I don't have to do it myself cause I don't have the program or know how to use it. I give her a deadline for October and pay her.  Well, I bust my ass on this book for months. It's the most important thing I've ever done with my life and it means everything to me. And 4 days before deadline, I find out she's only done up to Chapter 5 on the book. Which basically means she fucked off for 4 months, and did nothing, which means she's going to do a rush job. That automatically means more mistakes that I have to depend on her to fix, which she didn't in the first place, and she's totally shattered my trust.  I freaked the fuck out on her and had a hysterical meltdown. It was bad, and I don't make any excuses for it. I was really shitty to her. I panicked and thought she was going to hold the book hostage with procrastination, and I had no way to get the files from her. I'd put myself up shit creek, because it was too late for me to learn InDesign.  Well, she was defensive, to say the least. She said I don't need to police her time, and I should've known this is how she works. I felt like she was trying to gaslight me, so I posted on Facebook about the situation without naming names and asked other professional artist friends if this was appropriately professional behavior. They said no. That REALLY pissed her off, because a few days later I got a letter.  In it she said she'd done all this stuff for me (let you live in my house, put up with your shit etc.), said I didn't want her to have her dream family and dream life (she was doing horse archery competitions and I didn't want her to do that, either, apaprently), my shitty upbringing made me dysfunctional, and she gave me an ultimatum that I had to make a change. Until then she said she didn't want me to talk to her, and she was ""closing her door to me.""  I felt supremely judged, i.e. ""My perfect Mormon family was NEVER dysfunctional, so obviously you're the problem here, as a dysfunctional person yourself. Not me."" I felt like I'd been un-forgiven, ""Hey, remember all that stuff I said I forgave you for? Surprise!"" And I felt horrible, like I could never apologize enough, and that from here on out I was going to be scapegoated because I was the fucked up one and she was the squeaky-clean Mormon.  I left her alone for about 6 week, not talking to her like she said. Then I reached out, apologized, and asked if we could talk in person without anymore nastygram letters. And this, to be honest, is where I'm most mad at myself, because I wish I'd just cut things off the minute she started talking like her shit didn't stink. Instead, we met, and she said my apology made her angry because it sounded like I'd disregarded her letter. I was a bit taken aback, because the letter sounded like one of those venting things where you're supposed to write them but not send them, and instead she was acting like she'd sent me gospel I needed to abide by.  I said I felt like I was always going to be the wrong one, no matter what. She said I came from a dysfunctional family, compared me to a fear-agressive dog, and said ""Which problem is more in need of fixing?"" So in other words, yeah. Yeah, I was always going to be wrong, because no matter what she did I was always going to be worse because of my background. She said I'd declared her typesetting ""a failure"" before I even saw it, and insisted she'd done a good job. I told her there were obvious mistakes, like misaligned tabs and words running into illustrations, and she said she'd made the deadline and reiterated that once again, I should have known she procrastinates. I told for someone who had gone to church for twenty plus fucking years, she didn't know how forgiveness works because Jesus doesn't say ""Forgive thine enemies, until you've got a whole pile of ammunition and can really use that shit against them."" (I'm agnostic.) She said she'd already apologized (implication being that I couldn't forgive) and when I told her it felt like she could never make a mistake, she screamed ""YOU JUST WANT ME TO GROVEL!"" and stormed off. Her husband came out, yelled at me, and told me to ""handle my shit"" and called me a toddler. Previously he'd admitted to me in private that he wouldn't hire his own wife for a job because of her lack of professionalism.  The next day I wrote her saying I needed my book files, to make sure the publisher could make corrections. And once that was good to go, I told her I was glad we weren't friends anymore, because all her judgement was off my shoulders. She said she would have fixed the typesetting mistakes if I'd just told her, DURING the time she'd explicitly said not to talk to her, so it was my fault again for not getting things corrected. I was arrogant, you see, and she said she wasn't angry, just that she felt sorry for me, and told me ""You are your family.""  I am genuinely glad to not be friends with her anymore. She made the worst of assumptions about me, turned on me when SHE fucked up and made it MY fault, and got hyper-defensive and toxic  in her behavior while simultaneously calling me dysfunctional. Hindsight is 20/20, and I feel like she had too much to do with her baby, couldn't say no, and resented the task in the first place. She said she didn't come home every night and think ""I'm not going to work on typesetting tonight, just to piss off Plethora"" as if good intentions can't pave the road to hell and hurt people. I said we were shitty to each other, but she won't admit fault at all. And I know I don't need a judgemental perfectionist in my life.  But I'm still hurt, and outraged, and angry. I keep finding myself having arguments in my head when I'm driving or trying to fall asleep. I'm furious that everything became conditional suddenly, that I was retroactively unforgiven, and treated in the worst way by someone who sees themselves as morally superior. Winter is just finishing up so I haven't really been able to get out fo ra Meetup or something, but it's hard not to fee like you can't make a relationship work when a 14 year one just went down the drain because of something you did. I've read some other Reddits, where people have lost friendships over things like weddings, which make me feel a bit better. Bitching someone out because they dropped the ball on your creative work suddenly doesn't seem so unreasonable. But I'm mad I tried to make things work even after a bunch of red flags telling me I should've known better, and STILL ended up feeling like shit because I ""apologized wrong"" and ""wasn't good enough."" I miss who my friend used to be, not who she is now. I feel like the only thing that's going to take away the pain is time, but it's been months and I still feel the same way, and feel like I'm justified in never trusting anyone again, because if 14 fucking years aren't enough, what is? How do you get over the pain of things ending so badly when part of it was your responsibility, too?

" Being really bored again... I shall post.    Yesterday I went on a date with Elise. We went to see King Arthur. The theatre was nearly empty because it was 4pm on a Tuesday, but these two fat men sat a seat away from us. I think I counted 7 other people in the whole theatre. Not to mention one of these guys got on his cell phone for about 30 minutes. HOLY SHIT!!! I swear, some people need to be shot. Anyways, after the movie we sat in the parking lot debating about where to eat. Of course Elise refused to contribute, except for places within eyesight, so I had to choose. We finally went to Orlando's  where we proceded to eat overpriced (but very very good)  food. Afterwards we went to Elise's mom's house cuz her mom had made a chocalate cake. I stayed for about an hour then went home. I would have stayed longer, but I didnt want to overstay my welcome (especially since I havent been there in quite some time). All in all, I think the whole thing went pretty good.   Today I woke up at noon, which I HATE doing, but I was so tired. Yesterday I had to wake up really early to take Olivia to someone's house cuz my dad was going out of town. He goes out of town almost every week for his job. Olivia goes over to one of my dad's friend's house so I dont have to be chained down watching her. There are 4 other kids there which she gets along with fairly well, but she always wants to come home. Go figure. Our house is so boring.   Well, I gotta go figure out what to make for dinner. I didnt plan on Olivia being home so everything is frozen. Dinner should be interesting tonight.

"Susceptible Younger Sibling I have a sexually active younger sibling who severely lacks proper sex education. She will not confide in me, our parents or any family for that matter (she’s afraid that my extended family and myself will snitch to our highly-religious parents, who are against premarital sex), but casually revealed her ""activities” to our hairdresser who felt uneasy by what she had heard. With that said, the hairdresser informed me of what was said, fearing that my sister may be in danger of herself.   Situation:   My sister's partaking in sexual relations with her boyfriends (yes, boyfriends since they change every few weeks) WITHOUT protection. She has very low self-esteem, and goes for guys with “nothing going for them” (i.e. no job, no education, drug-dealing/taking, etc.). But what triggered my hairdresser (whose primary concern is SAFE sex) to contact me was the fact that her current boyfriend is uncircumcised, does not use protection and has convinced my sister that “pulling out” is safe sex—revealing their lack of adequate sex education. Furthermore, my sister has complained (to me/our parents) of yeast infections and UTI’s, checking in-and-out of the clinic on several occasions, but casually dismisses it as wearing too-tight skinny jeans. And while my mother is comfortably in-denial and takes everything my sister says for face value, my father and I have had our suspicions about what may really be going on for awhile now.  Some background information:  - Sister comes from an upper income family  - Youngest of 3, very spoiled - Fast-tailed, boy-obsessed, hates being single - (Barely) of legal age (technically “grown”, but not independent, so she lives with our parents who expects her to live by their rules until she moves out). - Was brought up Christian - Strong preference for men from poverty-stricken/rougher backgrounds and engage in illegal activities (I suspect she thinks it’s edgy?) - Has a job, but devotes every last penny either uber-ing/lyft-ing to be with her (job-less) boyfriends or loaning them money - Loving immediate/extended family - Very manipulative, yet extremely impressionable when it comes to guys - Current boyfriend is from overseas, deals/does cocaine (and pressures her to join in), jobless, without education, ill-tempered, manipulative and violent. Also his parents are entirely against their relationship due to her being of a different race/ethnicity than him.  - Previous boyfriend was also ill-tempered, manipulative and violent, but also physically/verbally abusive, dealt weed, had no job/HS drop-out and made a “runaway” attempt with my sister which was prevented after I “snitched” to my parents (hence the reason she no longer confides in me, but I felt it was necessary given the severity of the situation). Cops were even involved.   My parents have attempted to send her to a prestigious out-of-state college to get her mind off of guys and focus on her studies, however she shows very little interest in education, let alone bettering herself in any form or fashion. She “lives in the now” and has a very blinkered outlook on life.  With everything said, I would like advice on how to handle the situation (i.e. what to do with the information). Should I relay it to our parents and risk “rattling” on my hairdresser (i.e. the source/proof in which my parents will ask for)? Should I mind my business and risk my sister catching something more severe/getting pregnant/etc.? Not to mention her current boyfriend's gang/violent/drug-related background could potentially put our family at risk (she's revealed our location/faces via social media and casual talk--entirely against our wishes) should they ever break up or anything of the sort (we had to place a restraining order on her last violent boyfriend). I have a very strong conscience and do not believe that I could live with myself should the latter happen.

" OMG it is so hot and humid! Today was this || close to being absolutely horrible, but there was one saving grace, and I'll save that for the end of this post. So, today I realized the full extent of the work I have to do (and should be doing now, but its too fucking HOT to stay focused) and have not done. All of my classes where boring as hell, History was the usual blend of note taking and sitting around with nothing to do, but today it was like a sauna (this is not good). I skipped Chem. to go have lunch with Tegan, which was really fun ;-), this would be the saving grace I mentioned. After finally saying ""bye"" to her *sigh*, I booked it back to Elmira to make it to class only about 5 min late for Physics. Again it was like a sauna in that class, even with the windows open, and we watched a movie and worked on the project I left at home in my rush to meet Tegan on time. So effectively did nothing. English was the same except the whole class didn't do any work, even Mr. Miessner didn't seem like he wanted to do work so he just let us talk all class. That class was productive, gossip wise, because I found out some interesting things about Chadder's ex. which I found quite funny.  Verdict: day as a whole sucked serious ass, but there where a few good times (thanks Tegan) ",0,omg hot humid today close absolutely horrible saving grace save end post so today realized extent work and doing now fucking hot stay focused not done class boring hell history usual blend note taking sitting do today like sauna this not good skipped chem lunch tegan really fun saving grace mentioned finally saying bye sigh booked elmira make class min late physic like sauna class window open watched movie worked project left home rush meet tegan time effectively did nothing english class did not work mr miessner did not like wanted work just let talk class class productive gossip wise interesting thing chadder ex quite funny verdict day sucked as good time thanks tegan
" Well, I've never done a ""blog"" before so you'll have to grade me on a curve.  Today was another fun visit to the dentist.  Turns out, that tooth #27 (yes, it's that specific) needed a root canal.  To really be able to focus on that particular tooth, my dentist found it neccesary to use a dental dam.  All I could think of was sex ed. in high school talking about dental dams for oral sex.  If anyone I was with pulled out a dental dam, I wouldn't be able to run away fast enough.  My day was quite uneventful otherwise. Other news:  I am missing someone that is very important in my life. Recently, I had to ""restrict"" a friendship with someone I care deeply about because her fiance isn't such a big fan of me.  It really sucks but I know that things will work out for the best and that nothing is impossible :) Until next time, God bless and good night.

I'm sick of my parents I just cant stand them anymore. They treat me like a shit compared to my sister. I never ask my parents for money I eat at home so they don't give me money for lunch I don't buy things I'm using old phone that i bought 6 years ago with my own money. But my mother changed 3 phones in the last year. They threat my sister a lot better they gifted her a phone for christmas i got some shitty speakers that had the price tag on and believe me their price was not close to the phone's. They bought her a new car last year they gave her the money for the driving lessons and she want money from them everyday. So i need a new PC at the moment so i thought that i might ask them because i really need it and that's the only thing i have ever ask my parents for my I haven't asked for a single cent in my whole life. Everything i buy i buy with my saved money from grandparents. I even buy my studentbooks with my own money. And they refused. They told me if i have the money to buy it but I spent all i had to buy furniture for my room if i didn't i would've gotten only a bed in my room. I feel hated. They don't spend time with me neither give me money. Yesterday I offered them to give me the money for the PC and when i have the money i will return them but they still said no. I legit have no idea why they do it. I don't go out often i don't argue with them  and i have decent grades in school.

"Just wanted to share Hey, first time posting here. Just wanted to talk to someone there since is not really any option irl.  I just kind of threw away all the good prospects in my life over the course of a week and have been feeling like a piece of crap. Probably not news to anyone here, that's how it usually goes. But tonight I feel okay. I recently decided just to drop everything and run away (not the first time I've done it, I've gotten good at it actually) and have been just sitting while I wait for finances to become ready.  This is a record low point in my life, but tonight I changed how I feel about it by just getting some chores done, getting drunk, and treating myself the way I wish other people would treat me. I'm talking booze and watching horrible telivision from the 80's   And it dawns on me that I'll get another chance. I may have fucked things up this time but I've bounced back from fuckups before by just acting natural so I'm probably going to do so again. There will be more chances to treat people the way I want to be treated no matter what age I get to. I don't need someone to be nice to me, all I have ever needed in life is just to be nice to other people.  It's a silly sentiment but it's all I got right now, I hope it reaches someone else who can benefit from hearing it. If you pray, pray for me in the next three months because it's  all I got. Ask me for some nice nice words and I'll give some to you as personally as I can. Things get better when you're kind to others.

"Writing out my feelings in hopes of gaining some sense of catharsis I'd like to start by saying I don't think I'm a danger to myself. I'm tethered here pretty strongly by my family and my best friend. I can't see myself leaving them, because I've seen what it does to people when those closest to them go. I resent the fact that I can't go, at times, but there's nothing to be done about it really.   Most of the people in my life only ever knew my outer shell. The somewhat false personality that I put on in order to function. Over the last three years my mask has been crumbling away and the results haven't been pretty. It's been a viscous feedback loop that leaves me feeling worse and worse as people fall out of my life one by one, either by their own choosing or because I distance myself to hide my pain as I become less and less able to handle it.   The summer after my sophomore year I was in the darkest place of my life. I had to pull out of university and move home to get therapy. It was actually very effective, and my junior year was a home run. I was getting the highest test scores in STEM classes with 600 students, I was killing it in my philanthropic efforts, and I had more friends and social obligations than I knew what to do with.   My senior year I spent the fall studying abroad in France. It was magical. I fell in love for the first time. I wasn't reciprocated, but the thing I learned about love is that it doesn't have to be reciprocated to be the most beautiful thing you've ever felt.   When I got back from France, the seeds of my current ruin were planted. All throughout college I'd been heavily involved with a camp for kids whose parents have cancer. I did it because my dad had cancer when I was a little kid, and the people I met were all wonderful, but most of all because the only thing that gives me a sense of purpose is helping other people. It drives almost everything I do. This camp gave me a rock that I could cling to through the worst of my emotional storms.   The two directors of the camp were both new my senior year. While I was in France, one of them dropped out of school due to her own struggles with mental health. The director that was left over was completely overwhelmed, and entirely ineffectual. People left and right were telling me that I should take the open position. I didn't want it; I have ADHD as well as depression and I was so anxious about my lack of organization. Camp was in such a hole though, and for the sake of my friends and my campers and their families I did the only thing I felt like I could do, and took on the directorship.   It was rough. My co-director continued to do little of anything, and I felt like I was juggling grenades. I couldn't fuck this up. Kids I'd been mentoring for years needed this camp to cope in a healthy way, and for a number of parent couples, the week of camp was the last time they got to spend alone together before one of them would pass away from cancer.   My grades dropped a whole point, on average. My volunteer research suffered, and I really let down the post doc I was assisting (Sorry Bethany). My mental health took a nosedive as well.    I made camp happen. It was ugly and bumpy and unorganized, but I made it happen. I took solace in the fact that the kids didn't seem to notice the flaws, but it didn't do a lot good for my relationships with the other volunteers.   I redoubled my efforts at the beginning of my 5th and final year of college. I moved into a house with some of the other volunteers who I was closest to. I had to quit my research, and I couldn't keep my grades where I wanted them, but camp planning was progressing well, especially after our national organization took notice of the lack of effort on my co-director's part and added a third director, my friend and newly minted roommate A.    A helped enormously, but I still had so much on my plate. To cope with the stress, my drug use started to skyrocket. I was smoking weed and cigarettes all the time, and to keep up with all my biochemistry coursework and 8-10 planning meetings a week I was taking my prescribed adderall more often than I should have been. I became thoroughly addicted. In my final quarter of school, everything really fell apart.   I was completely overwhelmed, and became less and less effective at my job. I put A in the exact position that I had been in the previous year. I could feel him resent me more and more every day, but I was too ashamed to talk to him about it, and he never asked me how I was doing.   I barely graduated. As soon as school was over I quit adderall cold turkey, because it had been putting me in a very dangerous mental headspace for weeks, but until then it had remained a necessity. The withdrawals hit me like a truck. Getting out of bed felt like a truly herculean task. I was an empty husk of a human being and from graduation to camp in August I contributed almost nothing to the camp. I had nothing left to give.   A hated me by that point. He began to tell people what he thought of me, and they listened. I watched helplessly as some of my closest friends and roommates began to look down upon me, if not for what A was saying then for my severely depressed behavior. I couldn't even really blame them. After camp, when we had our traditional fun awards ceremony, A was awarded ""Most likely to make camp happen by himself"". I was awarded ""Linger"", a camp song I was known for singing, but also a very pointed jab. It was humiliating.  At the afterparty that night I drunkenly told A everything. He said it was ok, and I cried lying drunk on the porch.  I lived in the house with him for a few more months while I looked for a job. A was incredibly distant, and became more and more hostile over time. I got a job on a crab boat. I had a few reasons for doing it, but the most important reason in my head was that I might be lucky enough for it to kill me. The day I moved out A sent me a 6 paragraph essay over text, detailing everything I'd ever done that had disappointed him, and letting me know that there was nothing I could ever do to win his respect back.   I left the state to work on the crab boat. For 5 months I lived in isolation, either working or chain smoking weed to keep myself from ruminating on all my failures. The crab boat did almost kill me. Multiple times, in fact. In the end I quit, not because I was suddenly afraid to die, but because my captain was the most sadistic piece of human scum I'd ever met, and I couldn't take him any more.   I've spent the 5 months since then trying to find a job. 50+ apps out and I'm no closer than when I started. I've been up to visit the city I graduated in twice, but both times I've been wracked with crippling anxiety. I can tell how A affected the opinions of some of my closest friends, and it kills me.   So, that's where I am. I'm going to go smoke a cigarette and pray that I get my dad's cancer even younger than he did.

" During the last week of March 2004, two friends and I were on a road trip to New Orleans for spring break. The three of us fell for a police trap and were arrested in Stone County, Mississippi. My two friends were charged with misdemeanors for possession of marijuana and I was charged with a felony for possession of a controlled substance. I took the wrap for the six hits of acid we had in the car because the two of them had recently discovered they were going to have a baby. If I hadn't taken the blame, all three of us would have been charged with felonies and the two of them would be in much more trouble now than I am.  Flash forward to today...  I am 23 years old. I am a college graduate (Bachelors in Communication  ; Art). I am employed by my father (who spent $4,800 to bail me out of jail). I work as a detailer, graphic designer, and a networking technician. On the weekends I work for an entertainment company as a disc jockey. I have a $3,000 credit card debt, a $17,000 student loan debt, and a $4,800 debt to my parents. One day, within the next year or two, I will have to go to court for the felony. Right now, I barely make enough money to pay my bills and some how I have to save for lawyer fees.

"I am a 26 year old married mother of three boys. I was recently diagnosed as having depression. I have noticed it getting a lot worse in just the past week. At first I thought to myself I don't have anything to be depressed about but the more I thought about it the more I realized what it was. Me and my husband used to spend time with our kids and go out and do things on Fridays or the weekends. I can't remember the last time we just went to Walmart as a family for no reason other than to go. My husband doesn't understand what the effect of him not spending that time with me and us has had on me. Just like tonight instead of asking me and the boys to run to town with him, his friend went. I don't care if he is only going for an hour that's an hour we could have his time. I cry all the time when he's not here just because I miss my husband. I'm 26 we should have a healthy active life with our kids but instead I work and come home, and on my days off I sit at home with my kids. When he is off he stays at home. He works and then him and his friend if they get off early go places in town and then he comes home. I don't get to do that. I can't remember the last time I just went window shopping, just running around. My thoughts about not being around have gotten worse and that terrifies me.

" I know that I am not alone in the 'loving the wrong man' line....   How many of us look for love in all the wrong places? How many of us confide in our best friends or our mothers (gasp!) that the man who is most important to us is unfortunately attached to someone else? How many of us intend for these things to happen? Probably none of us. We just seem to have a penchant for something that doesn't belong to us.....  And then I have to ask....does anyone really belong to anyone but themselves? Shouldn't we belong to ourselves? Shouldn't we do as  we  see fit?  No.... probably not. Because we harm others when we do this. Actually we harm ourselves, our psyches, our very souls.  We show ourselves to be without value. We are unimportant. We don't count. And we do this to ourselves.    Do we want to hurt others? No. I don't think that most of us even have any guilt about what we are doing. The man certainly doesn't. I seem doomed to be someone's midlife crisis. And no I am not that young.

He actually called me once from his home. I asked him if he was out of his fucking mind. I don't know why I am doing this.  Because he smells so wonderfully fine and he tastes so good. Because he kisses like Kenny G's music sounds. Because everyone I want seems to be married ....or gay.

And he twinkles and flirts and makes you want to well......I don't know lick him or something....sometimes I hate men.  This one tells me that I am his 'Whiskey Lullaby'.

"Can’t fix anything in my life I’m such a fundamentally broken person. I’ve want to say I’ve been fighting for years, but that’a not true. All I can do is fucking run away from everything until the day is over. No action I take to improve myself can ever have weight because I’m so godddamn broken that when I try to do something to better myself, it just reminds me of how much of a fucking loser I am. I cannot handle the fucking *pain* that comes with self improvement. It’s not fun in the least. It’s humbling. Too humbling. And it just shoves in my face all the time I’ve wasted and all of the experiences I never had simply by virtue of being my self.   Everyone who’s happy acts like life is just some natural occurrence. Like things just happened to them and fell into place. This couldn’t be further from the truth of my experience. Nothing ever just happens organically. Either I try hard and fail due to my lack of intelligence, or I don’t do anything at all. It’s hard to stay happy after constant failure and social rejection. I’ve never had interests or goals or relationships or friends. I never will. These thing don’t just happen. You have to be a certain kind of person for them to happen. I am not that person. I will never be that person because I don’t even know who I want to be, and if I figured that out I would be too insecure to become that.   All I see in my future is homelessness and destitution because I came into adulthood with absolutely zero interests, special memories, or relevant/helpful past experiences. My memory of my life in general is so goddam hazy at this point, if I ever did have those things, they have long been gone to the abyss. I just think why. Why do I have to be so broken and dysfunctional among everyone else? I’m not even a real person. I’m a complete shell of what could have been a person. This is too difficult to come to terms with, while impossible to argue against. It is true. It is my reality. It honestly just makes me angry, bitter, and jealous of others, at a very deep, fundamental, human level, for what the healthy people have. I fantasize about taking two AR-15s and unloading on people. Maybe I know them, maybe I don’t, it wouldn’t matter. Often lives completely lose their value when my headspace gets dark enough. Not as the result of an “illness” but of the fact that I am who I am both physically and psychologically. Blind rage. That is what the result of my dysfunction is. Pure fucking anger at both the world and myself. Unable to cope with my grim reality, all I want to do is destroy.   The only thing I could ever really destroy is myself. The thought of my life slipping away becomes more attractive by the day as I see how impossible my desires are and how completely fruitless any effort to change is sure to be, just like it always has. I can’t handle the responsibility of being alive and I don’t want to anymore. I’m just here for the hedonistic pleasures life sometimes offers, until either I or something else kills me.

" Now that it's the middle of July, and my best friend is in California for the entire month, and my computer doesn't have internet, I feel really strange. It's like lonely, but not necessarily bored. Last week I rented Prince of Persia: Sands of Time for my Gamecube, and even kept the game past its due date  to finish it, it was that good. So I'm not necessarily bored. Like tonight, for instance, I finished 'Lucky', by Eddie de Oliveira (he's cute). It was a really good book, and I'm glad I read it. However, now that the game is played, and the book is read, I seriously need something more to do. I hoped to have a job by now, but then, I had also hoped to be going on student exchange this autumn, but it's amazing how, no matter how hard you try, some plans just refuse to come to fruition. It's neurotic.

" Hey, I feel like its been awhile, when in all relativety, my mind is always thinking and it feels like awhile, because things come and go in my head, and by the time, i get to this very ""subject"" of this post, I have been through many other subjects as well.  First off,   to get it off my mind, I just saw the movie ""little black book"" and ending said something like, life happens most, when you are planning for something that is approaching. So stop planning and live your life now. That totally goes against my life, because I have always been the planner, because then I think that I get what I want. But what if I didnt plan, and got what I needed the most, and secretly wanted the most too. But then if you dont plan at all, you could be a loser who doesnt do anything. Conflicting thoughts. I have always told myself not to plan so much, its just that it comes so naturally to me, to plan for college, plan why someone likes me, plan how i mangage my friends, money...everything. Maybe I will start by unplanning some of those things..and letting them come to me. One small thing at a time. I suppose.   we;ll talk soon.

"Hello. I am just getting over a suicide attempt, my 2nd. It was extremely serious. I was planning it for week, and when I was fired form my job I did it the next day. I have a BS in chemistry and worked testing pharmacological products, so i knew what to take. I don't know what made me call my ex-BF. I did not speak to him for 4 months, but I wanted him to be the one to find me. Needless to say I lived. The doctors where surprised that I did. I took 3 things, (not going to give people ideas) that i knew they could not do anything for because of them being together. They could not pump my stomach cause of the one thing. They could not give any antidotes cause of interactions. I took well over the lethal limit. My life was spiraling out of control since Jan of 98. Since then, I have had 3 heart and 2 cancer operations. I was discharged from the Navy, was an officer, because of the medical stuff. My 1st suicide attempt was in the navy, they chalked it up to being stupid and not dealing with the 1st heart and cancer surgeries. My parents had a bitter divorce and I was caught in the middle when I got home. My mother assumed my ID and ran up a bunch of bills. I came out of the closet. I slept around to feel wanted. Which was not a wise choice, I gained my 3rd major medical situation. Not going to say what, but I am sure you can figure it out. I have a soul mate that I hurt, my ex-BF, and who knows if we will ever be friends or more. 2005 was a blur. I do not remember things, or saw things that where not there. Like documentation, which led to me being fired. I was afraid to leave the house, and was even afraid of 5 year olds selling candy for the school. The good thing about the suicide attempt is there was a proper diagnosis. I compartmentalized, and pushed emotions away. Every situation or moment had its own little box, and I put it away. I wanted to be like Spok or Data. I would put on different mask for different situations. There was shopping me, gas pumping me, heck, i had a separate mask for every action I performed. I have abandonment issues, from how i was treated growing up. Medicines did nothing and gave bad side effects. My depression is not chemical, but mental. I need to re-learn how to think and handle emotions and issues properly. Unemployment is running out, people are looking for money for bills. But it is better to be alive. WOW, this was longer than I intended. Just saying who I am, and I am a mess.....but slowly putting my life together.",1,hello just getting suicide attempt nd extremely serious planning week fired form job did day b chemistry worked testing pharmacological product knew take not know exbf did not speak month wanted me needle say lived doctor surprised did took thing not going people idea knew not together not pump stomach cause thing not antidote cause interaction took lethal limit life spiraling control jan then heart cancer operation discharged navy officer medical stuff st suicide attempt navy chalked stupid not dealing st heart cancer surgery parent bitter divorce caught middle got home mother assumed id ran bunch bill came closet slept feel wanted not wise choice gained rd major medical situation not going say what sure figure out soul mate hurt exbf know friend more blur not remember thing saw thing not there like documentation led fired afraid leave house afraid year old selling candy school good thing suicide attempt proper diagnosis compartmentalized pushed emotion away situation moment little box away wanted like spok data different mask different situation shopping me gas pumping me heck separate mask action performed abandonment issue treated growing up medicine did gave bad effect depression not chemical mental need relearn think handle emotion issue properly unemployment running out people looking money bill better alive wow longer intended just saying am messbut slowly putting life together

"Not invited to my friend's wedding. Is it time to abandon ship? A guy I have been close friends with for the last 13 years is getting married this year and I've come to the realisation that I'm not invited to the wedding. To be honest, we are not as close as we used to be. We used to hang out all time, but as lives became busy, we spent less time together. I still attend almost all of his social gatherings, though that is probably only 3 to 4 times a year. The weird thing is, I was invited to his engagement party. I got him and his partner a really meaningful gift that they still comment on whenever they see me, yet they didn't invite me the wedding. When I was slightly intoxicated at another friend's girls night some time ago, I asked the bride if invites had been sent out yet because I couldn't remember receiving mine. We then began the awkward exchange in which she told me it was really hard to narrow down the guest list and I realised I was never getting my invite. I tried to act as if I wasn't offended and that I understood, but honestly, I'm really hurt. I've been invited to the hen's night which is in a month. It is not a cheap night. Upwards of $200 for accommodation, games etc. It feels rude to expect me to pay so much to attend a hen's night when they wouldn't even pay for me to be a guest at their wedding. But I also realise that if I don't go to the hen's, it could come across that I don't value the friendship enough to go.

" I was at a wedding in NH this past weekend, and I can't help but wonder how many more weddings I will attend before I myself get married. I'm not dating anyone currently, but this getting married thing seems to be catching on like wild fire. Not that I am opposed to it. In fact, when I was in my last major relationship, I was pushing for it myself. But why? Did I think he was the one? Well, it did cross my mind, but I just saw him for the first time since we broke up on Sunday (after the Sat. wedding) and it is amazing to see how far we both are from that now. Does it make sense to get married when you don't know what you yourself want out of life? I'm starting to realize that the answer to that last question is 'no.' So, I don't think I am going to go looking for a husband any time soon, since I need to figure out my own path first.... but I must say, it is difficult to sit there by yourself and witness all the couples planning their weddings knowing how far off you might be. That must be a girl thing though!

"New friends Hi,  I’m new here. I have a huge problem.  It’s extremely hard for me to trust people I have a bond with (friends). Out of fear of rejection or disapproval for my actions, I don’t dare to become closer. I fear people will leave me eventually, so the idea that I have friends, isn’t present. When it is present, I feel like I need to stay in touch very often.  I feel reluctant to take initiative often. If I don’t get asked for something, it’s a strong sign I’m not wanted. This has become standardized. I have some vague friends, but they live far away. We can’t that close, don’t share many interests, but we like each other. We can’t meet up often.   What can I do to find new friends and do regularly something in my neighborhood. I’m close to a city, but I live in a village. I’m all day home (except for school and such), don’t feel energized to take action. Sigh.  Getting advice like ‘find a sport, hobby, club’ doesn’t help much, I get suck.

"When I was 16 I was raped by my boyfriend. I was a virgin at the time and it was really hard to accept that this had happened to me. I thought that somehow if I didn't say anything to anyone or raise a fuss about it it wasn't true. But it only made it worse. When I tried to break up with him he tried to kill me. We worked together and that made it really difficult to avoid him. He told all his friends at work that I had ""given it up to him"" which wasn't true. I was mocked and teased by the people that i felt had grown to be my family.   Now, five years later it is still something that hangs tightly in my mind and heart.

"Hi, I am new here and don't know where to start, where to post or anything. I don't know what can help me, but I know that I don't like my self, and I am unhappy most of the time. I am not currently on any medicines (can't even do that right) and have never really been tested or diagnosed with anything other than depression. I live my life day dreaming of what could be and what should be......I am a 38 year old female and my problems started when I was born. I was born to an alcoholic dad whom I loved and a mom who did the best she could whom I love as well. My whole family was in therapy from about the time I was 4 years old. Our family therapist/doctor was Dr. Love, I am not kidding that was his real name. All kinds of things were going on in my family that I was not aware of until I was grown. One was the fact that my real father was sexually molesting my older half sister.......I was labeled a ""bad child"" ""out of control child"" and was locked in my room for hours at the time which was what our doctor told them to do.....I would not cry when I was punished or spanked and my mom would have to stop my dad from whipping me to keep him from killing me I suppose. I was the youngest of 4 children, 1 real sister 1 half sister and one half brother. Although after I was grown I found out that my real sister was only half too... I was very creative in a strange kind of way while I was locked in my room. I would open my window a scream for help with my tape recorder on, so when I got tired I could play it back so maybe someone would come......we had big metal blinds in the windows and for some reason I would raise the blind all the way up and tie the string to my door knob when I would go to sleep at night so the blind would fall if anyone opened my door... Crazy huh??? Any way, when I was about 11 years old I was put in a foster home, you know cause I was a bad child. Then I went to group homes, back and fourth here and yonder. Never tested for anything.....never medicated.....I was back and fourth from home, foster homes, group homes and mental hospital from the age 11 to 16. During one of the times I was gone my parents divorced, and my mom moved to a new house. I had met a guy during one of my short stays home, and thought that he was my world. You know by then I thought no one loved me, except for him. He was my world. My oldest sister told me that if we got married I couldn't be sent away any more. She knew how it was being at those places in the 70's and 80's....I mean if you weren't already ""mad"" you would be.....So I married the only person in the world that I thought loved me......As soon as we were married, I got pregnant. He cheated on me, controlled me, I couldn't even go outside without him beating me. He would come in from his girlfriend's house and if I said anything about it, he would go off and throw things and call me every name in the book, take aerosol spray cans and a lighter and throw flames at me until I was in the corner begging and crying for him to stop. He beat me in my stomach and said he hoped I lost the baby. He said if I ever left him he would kill me. I had to get stitches over my eye where he busted it. Of course I lied to the doctor.....scared for my life. All of this went on for a year, when my daughter was born he was not even there. His parents had to go get him out of his girlfriends bed....I was young and dumb. I thought that everything would get better now, I mean he was the only one in the world that ""loved"" me. Things got worse and when my daughter was weeks old he got in one of his moods and was beating on me and his grandma. That's who we lived with. He went out in the yard and took an axe to all the cars and his dad came over to stop him. My husband took the baby out of my arms and held her over his head in the street and threatened to drop her......that's the day I left him. His father called the police and had them come get him. Then he called my mom and told her she had better come get me and the baby if she didn't want us dead.

" Well I think I know what my problem is. I'm not opinionated enough to own a blog. I'm totally indifferent about almost everything, so I can never think of anything to write.  Maybe I'll just write about what I did last night. Ben and I went to the park with his aunt, uncle, and cousins to watch a Tongan brass band play. We ate chicken from Sugarhouse Barbecue and it was so yummy. I don't know what their secret is, but their chicken tastes just like camping. Then the plan was to go back to the cousins' house to have brownies and ice cream and play Halo, so I asked to be dropped off at home because I didn't want to stay up all night. Plus I don't enjoy video games very often. Well they opted out of playing Halo because they wanted me to come have ice cream with them, so I went, even though I hate it when people change their plans for me. It makes me feel whimpy. So anyway, you might think that means we got home at a reasonable hour, but we still ended up staying there until midnight. I don't know how those guys (Ben's cousins/aunt/uncle) can stay up so late all of the time and still get up at 6:30 to go to work. It's hard for me! For some reason, as soon as I graduated from college, I turned into an old fart who has to go to bed on time. Totally lame.  Well it looks like I have a little bit of an opinion after all...at least about people changing their plans for me and going to bed on time. Who knew?

"Grandmother asks for loan to estranged father, then refuses to carry debt I'm mostly estranged from my father who has narcissistic personality disorder, lives as a squatter in the forest, and works only part-time. Meanwhile, I work in Silicon Valley.  His sister made a huge effort to contact me, which I ignored for months understanding that she likely has a personality disorder as well. Eventually, I relented and agreed to meet my father for dinner over the holidays.  In February, I received a call from my paternal grandmother saying my dad needs a loan because he lost his temporary job (he has regular seasonal employment) and employment-insurance benefits have recently been changed where he lives. I called my dad and he asked for a loan of $5,000. I felt sorry for the guy, so I wired him the money. After further thought, I feel this is quite a bit more than he needs to be homeless for a few months and carry his credit card payments until getting new employment.  Meanwhile, my grandmother has just sold her mobile home for $60,000 and left a voicemail to tell me of this and ask if I was willing to drive down and pickup some boxes. This isn't realistic, if I did go there I would fly rather than drive for 8 hours.  I called her back and asked if she would assume her son's debt. This saves me the stress of servicing the loan and I have no interest in lending money whatsoever. Since she has cash from selling her house, she is easily able to do this now. Her son can pay her back.  She told me that the money from the house was needed for her retirement and that she's ""on social security."" I responded, ""I'm saving for retirement too."" (I make the full $18,500 401(k) contribution each year to avoid ending up in the forest like my dad and this in addition to paying into social security which probably won't even exist when I am 67) ""That's no way to talk to your grandmother. I'm going to hang up if you..."" at which point I hung-up the phone.  My instinct her is to forget about getting the money back and just disconnect from all three: dad, grandmother, and the aunt (who I should have just ignored).  Any thoughts?",0,grandmother asks loan estranged father refuse carry debt estranged father narcissistic personality disorder life squatter forest work parttime meanwhile work silicon valley sister huge effort contact me ignored month understanding likely personality disorder well eventually relented agreed meet father dinner holiday february received paternal grandmother saying dad need loan lost temporary job he regular seasonal employment employmentinsurance benefit recently changed life called dad asked loan felt sorry guy wired money thought feel quite bit need homeless month carry credit card payment getting new employment meanwhile grandmother just sold mobile home left voicemail tell ask willing drive pickup box not realistic did fly drive hour called asked assume son debt save stress servicing loan lending money whatsoever cash selling house easily able now son pay back told money house needed retirement on social security responded i saving retirement too i make k contribution year avoid ending forest like dad addition paying social security probably not exist that way talk grandmother going hang you point hungup phone instinct forget getting money just disconnect three dad grandmother aunt who just ignored thought

I'm a prick for not posting for so long. But, lately ... okay not lately.

" this is the first time i ever done one of these, it seems a little awkard for me considering i'm such a shy person  But i feel its something that i need, no one listens anymore.  Its like there deaf to everything i say, i'm going unheard....its a really painful feeling.  i heard a song today by story of the year, ""anthem to out dying day"", it was a song that appealed to me in no sort of reason, but i still felt compelled to do something.  i have listened to it non-stop for about 2 hours and it still hasn't gotten old for me.  Its a new one for me considering i like songs for about a week then never listen it for awhile.  i don't know what but it appeals to something in my life, something i've been wanting for awhile.....her. she is one of the most perfect people i have ever seen i my life. She lights up my entire life when ever i am near her.  its like nothing i've ever felt, and it aches...because i can't tell her how it feels...how will she react?  she is the type of person that isn't very open...like me.....i can't just tell her ""hey i love you baby!""  that just won't cut it, for me and for her.  It seems like she wants something more in a relationship, something i'm trying to find and seem to have found, but can't tell her.  Will she reject or rejoice?  I know it seems like a cliche type of love story but that is just the way this story is.  I wish she would just run into to my arms and say, i love you and nothing is never going to change that.

I won't too, but i just can't.  I don't want to ruin what we already have.  I keep thinking that she will freak out and our relationship will never be the same with her.

"Does anyone else imagine their depression as being much more 'dramatic' than it actually is? I always think of my depression as being something quite mysterious and I dramatise it in my own mind. It's as if my brain is just trying to make something of depression, which ultimately makes it worse because it gives part of my brain comfort in depression, as it least it gives me some kind of identity.  I imagine it as being this huge struggle with myself, almost like a character in a movie or a book and glorify the worst parts of it to provide myself with any comfort I can. It's pretty toxic but it's one of the only ways I can deal with it, does anyone else find themselves doing a similar thing?",1,doe imagine depression wouldramatic actually is think depression quite mysterious dramatise mind brain just trying make depression ultimately make worse give brain comfort depression give kind identity imagine huge struggle myself like character movie book glorify worst part provide comfort can pretty toxic way deal it doe doing similar thing
"Tipped off by someone that best friend is not okay It's been a semester in college and people here are very interesting.  Recently, I [F] made a best friend Theo* [M] in class. We're both in the same major, speak the same native language, and he always helps me understand the homework (he's smarter than me), meaning that we spend about 2 hours/day together, if not more. We got super close within a few weeks, and I started to develop a crush on him. But I have a boyfriend (long-distance), and my feelings for Theo were not sexual, so I resolved to think of Theo as just an older brother - it hasn't been a problem for a few weeks now. We still hang out as best friends.  My primary means of communication with him is facebook in our native language. A week before, he added me on snapchat, but we never talk on it. The other day, I got a snap with a mispelling of my name, to which I sent a question mark. The day after, I got a snap from a girl Lucy* claiming to be Theo's boyfriend, who told me she got my username from Theo. She told me that he was acting weird, and for my name w/mispelling, to look out for him since they were also long distance.   I don't know how to approach the situation. I want to make sure that Theo is okay, since I did have some problems with suicidal/bored/lonely friends before. But he never told me that he has a girlfriend or about Lucy, and when I took to other forms of social media to find her, I couldn't find her - she wasn't in any tagged photos of Theo either. I may be completely over thinking, but I also think that Lucy has ascess to Theo's snap, which is how she got to me - meaning that I'm not sure if Theo knows that I know Lucy. If she has ascess to the snap, she could also have acess to his facebook (although I'm pretty sure she can't speak our native language).... Basically, I'm not sure how to approach him to ask if he's okay okay. I always ask how his day was, and it ranges from okay to sleepy. So if I ask if he's okay, he might ask me why I thought he wasn't okay, and I don't think I can say his girlfriend was wondering - we don't talk about relationship stuff, I don't think he know I have a boyfriend, although this is posted all over my social media.

" OK. I've been wanting to blog for awhile. Thing is I can't decide how honest I want to be in it. What if someone in the family found it? Guess I'll just have to take that chance. So anyway, what I really wanted to write about is Shana. I hate talking to anyone in the family about her because I don't want to upset them. I mean, what if they're having a good day? Then I pour out all of my stuff and make them start grieving again. Although I know, realistically, that we'll never stop grieving. I still cannot believe that she killed herself. Immediately after, that week, sometimes someone would say it must have been an accident. But come on, Shana was brilliant. She knew how little she was. Taking a bottle of anti-depressants and pain pills was not an accident. She wanted to leave. She wanted the pain to stop. That's why she took them at bedtime.  I still hear my brother describing how he found her. Right after we got to the house he told us everything. Took us up to Shana's room and showed us her bed. Showed us where he carried her to the top of stairs and tried CPR. Told us the police had to pry her out of his arms. Told us she was already getting stiff. And she was cold, he said, so cold. Sometimes I can't stop hearing the stuff from that week. I can hear him crying my name.  I remember so much from that week. Picking out the fingernail polish, helping Grandma iron her clothes. Previewing her hair and makeup with my sisters. We took a picture for reference. My sister was so tough. I couldn't see the details through the tears but J did.  Even writing in my journal I feel like I need to edit stuff out. But I can't. It's time to get this stuff out. Shana's been gone for over a year and I still don't really believe it. She was only 19 and had so much to live for. I'll never stop wondering why.  Her suicide note was in her live journal. Titled ""Enough is Enough"". That's it. I'm done. I love you all... The same message, or maybe a little longer, was set up as an 'away' message in outlook. I never could bring myself to email her so I'd get it back as a reply. I asked my sister if she'd made up an album of Shana stuff. She said she thought the pictures belonged interspersed with other family pictures. I don't know though. Seems like I might do an album - but do I put the funeral notice and program in there too? I wanted to keep them. Don't know why.

"What Depression is Like For Me. Having depression is like sailing with a hole inside your boat and only a bucket to keep you afloat. Depression is wanting to have friends but are too anxious to go out and stay a while longer. Depression is forcing yourself out of bed, not for yourself but those who count on you. Depression is having an empty feeling inside your chest while your head is crowded with self loathing. Depression is where people tell you ""it will all get better"" but only hearing the silent whispers of the wind. Depression is where you slowly lose your personality, joy, and interest for those things that you have used to love. Depression is where a stranger tells you ""I'll be here for you"" and you take it as an insult.  Depression is where you hurt, crawl on the floor crying, grabbing on to dear life alone in your dark room with your thoughts, too tired to do anything and then go to bed only to rise again to pretend that nothing happened.  To pretend, nothing happened.

The scariest thing is when I occasionally find, or think I find, her mental illness in myself.. certain tendencies to obsess, feel abandonment that isn’t real and lashing out because of it, etc. When that happens I just feel so disgusting and shameful. In those moments I wish that she wasn’t my mom and that I wasn’t her son, or that I could permanently swap heads with someone else.  I think about all this as my fiancé and I talk about having kids. Both of us are ready and we want to be parents so very badly, though I haven’t brought up my fears to her. I worry often about passing on that illness to our children. My fiancé doesn’t deserve that, she shouldn’t have to face those hard challenges. I love her so much and the thought of doing that to her kills me inside. I feel so much shame around wanting to be a parent because of this that I wonder if I should be one at all, or rather, a biological one.  It’s something I’ve never really thought about before now and I don’t know what to do.

We target english rock, though i myself prefer chinese and jap rock. But through my friends' persuation, I decided to try it out.

"Call me Mrs. Self-Destruction Everything I do is wrong. I was given every advantage in life: intelligence, compassion, athleticism, even looks. I have spent the last 11 years (since 15) sabotaging my own success. I'm now  in full self-destruct mode.   No anti-depressant works for me. Every medication makes me miserable and sick unless it is a stimulant, and I don't want to be stuck on stimulants. I used to drink as a crutch and now I can't.   My husband and I were separated and moved back in together. He is an addict too and going through withdrawal, so he is extra-sensitive. My ex decided that it would be a great time to blackmail me with Facebook statuses and tag my husband in them. I didn't tell my spouse about the blackmail because of the potential fallout, because things were finally good. Now I realize I just hurt him worse. Needless to say... he is pissed. It just makes things worse.    I have no motivation at work. Therapy is not working and I need a new therapist, but I don't have the energy or self-love to care enough to do anything about my issues. I am in a black hole when everyone thinks I live a charmed life. I have been depressed since I was five years old and I don't know how long I can hold on without losing it.  What do I even do?

"This is a great topic. It looks like people associate with what was shared. I was laughing a little because for awhile I was so hypersensitive to sound I would not even consider turning anything on that created noise, even the noise from lights was too much. I used to go to a counselor who had a radio on in her waiting room. I could not stand it and used to turn it off. Then someone would turn it back on, having no understanding of what it was like to be me at that moment. That's funny to me now. I still don't like noise but I'm lucky since I have pretty good control over my environment. For awhile I was working in cubicles and was not sure I was going to make it. The one comment I wanted to share was what I experienced when I did turn the TV back on, read the newspaper, listened to the radio. I went without it for two years. What I experienced was the way the news was presented. I was captivated not by the words or circumstances of stories, but the tone of voice, the selection of what sound bites to use, the background chosen for a shot. I'm still fascinated by all that and even dreamed the other night I had been hired to be that person who decides how to present something. In my dream I was having a moral dilemma. My integrity is important to me and, in my dream, I was talking to my boss and trying to explain the emotional angst I was in. She kept saying, give them what they want, who are you to decide what is best for them. I woke up before I decided to quit or stay. But those words stayed with me through a day, who am I to decide what's best for someone else? What I do now is selectively listen to the news. I like NPR and sometimes enjoy McNeil Lehrer. I find if someone is expressing a strong opinion I will get annoyed if the presentation does not also include an opposing viewpoint. My main issue is selective presentation. I feel disrespected if someone is asking me to just trust them. I want to know what are the observations leading to a conclusion. I want to know what level of uncertainty there is. I don't like anyone telling me how to think or feel. I'm perfectly capable of creating all the drama I could ever use, on my own. I'm not clear where to place blame for all the drama the industry of information puts out there. I know someone is to blame. If only I could find that person or group then my hatred would be perfect. I'm kidding about that last sentence. I'm just trying to get a rise out of someone reading my share--I'm being frisky. I support public broadcasting and free speech. If I was in charge meetings would last forever because everyone would get a chance to speak. Wouldn't it be great if there truly was free speech in America. Wouldn't it be great if the principle of dissent was truly an American ideal.

" Hello and blessed be to all! Well, this is the beginning of my new journal. I had one on AOL, but for personal reasons moved my writings of my escapades to BloggerLand. I've also had numerous physical journals and I've only recently started online journals. As you can see, I love to write. It is one of my greatest passions and sometimes I must write to feel better.  I'm also just as passionate about history, theater, and Paganism. So I guess you could call me a Pagan writer-actor-historian.   Lil' bit bout myself: My name's Brian and I'm 17, living in Hartford, CT. I go to Bulkeley High School and the Academy of the Arts, and I'm overall happy with that. I'm a senior now, and life doesn't seem any different. I guess it's because of my up bringing that I feel like that. You see, I live with my mother, stepfather, and three brothers and our family's pretty boring. For all you kids out there with no siblings, I HATE you. You are too lucky. Siblings-especially brothers-can be a pain in the arse. Trust me, I have three of them!!   A couple of things have made my existence a bit more bearable. Firstly, my faith. I am a proud and out-of-the-broom-closet Pagan who loves the Great Mother. I've been Pagan for five years, and my specialty is healing and the Tarot. I have more Pagan books than I don't know who, and for the most part they were worth the money. I'm also blessed with the gift of the arts. I have dabbled in just about all the arts: painting, photography, songwriting, puppetry, but my two favorites are theater and writing. Though I don't want to be a professional actor, I still at least want to be an  amateur  actor; amateurism deserves more dedication than a hobby, but not as much as a profession.  I just love the theater, but being a professional actor is too harsh a life for me. I want to be a history professor. It isn't as exciting as being an actor, but I love it nonetheless. It is also a very flexible career, and it'll allow me to write--my other passion.     I hope to one day be a published author, but right now I'm just writing. I usually never finish a story or elaborate an idea, but at least I'm writing it down. Eh? I write all kinds of shtuff, but short stories are my speciality. As I continue to write in my journal, I'll slip in a piece or two to entertain any and all.    Well, that's enough writing for now. Enjoy my escapades!!

"Uneasy family members I have had a rough and lonely childhood, in fact i do not want to remember my childhood. There used to be daily fights in the house between my mom and dad. My mom used to talk rudely then and talks rudely even now. She behaves differently outside the house and is a complete different person inside the house, behaves as though we are a burden for her. My dad is no angel either, he is arrogant and adamant, impatient and often has anger control problems, never felt close to him when a child and even now. Never felt any love towards my parent, I always had thoughts about running away from them. To add fuel to the fire my Father's mother will try to instigate any fight on any trivial matter between my mom and dad,I stayed all along with her throughout my childhood but I always thought of her as a monster. She never allowed me or my brother to ever mingle with other children freely and we didn't have many friends. I feel suffocated between my family and want to move away from them shift to another place and be independent. I have finished my graduation and still stay with my family but i feel they sap my energy and I am always negative and depressed staying with them. Criticism is a big part of our family, you are not spared if you make even a minute mistake. Appreciation word is not in my family's dictionary. On top of that my family is conservative and my mom is very very conservative in the bad sense. She will criticize other girls and women for wearing slightly short or tight clothes, but if someone wears the same clothes in our family she will applaude it. My father too judges women based on the clothes they wear and how they look, he doesn't spare men either calling them names based on their physical features. I am tired with this outlook and want to leave the house as soon as possible.There is no room for opinion in my family, especially my father who does not want to listen to anybody else and has fought with me on several occasions. He does not spare me insulting in front of other people. I don't feel easy staying along with them and at the same time feel guilty for depending financially on them. I have always felt hate for them in my heart and mind.

"What's wrong with me? I just want to know what's really wrong with me, should I get help or something...I often think about myself like I'm a negative person. Some people describe me as cold as I don't really have any genuine reactions to anything just pure neutrality some even say I lack empathy. I keep most of my feeling and thought for myself and the only thing that's wierdly funny to me is dark humor and misfortune of others. My attitude on the outside, most of the times, is ""I don't care"", but when I'm alone, then shit goes down, anxiety, depression, dark thoughts you name it. I can go days without seeing anyone or speaking to anyone when I'm in this pit of my own making. But then again, I still have this slight need to socialise after some time. The thing is, some time ago, one of my closest friends asked me, what made me happy, when was the last time I was truly happy? And what worried me, I couldn't think of anything, still after thinking for like an half our, there was nothing. Don't get me wrong, I still laugh and sometimes even smile, but for me positive and happy people seem fake. Anyone in a similar situation? Some advice would be appreciated.

" You wanna know why this girl looks how she looks?  Well this poor little girl was forced by me to talk with me  for more than an hour.  Hmm you wonder why I did this?  Well lets start with the background  Since Simon (a class mate of mine) invited us to a grill party, this became a tradition. The photo was taken at such a party and me being very drunk started  to talk to every girl telling her such great things like  ""You're the horniest in our gradates!"" or ""You can run but I'll  always find you""  Well for this not being embarassing enough I looked for a victim I can talk to for longer time, well there she was!  This time I was in love with a chubby cheeked girl named Karen. Luckily my ""conversation partner"" was the best friend of her. So the conversation was only about how Karen and I match together.  You can imagine that me being very drunk said things, which I had better not said.  Finally I can only say that I don't remember all the stuff I told her, but my opinion about relationships and what is important in such relationships were the best things I told her, because now everybody knows what a horny  guy I am with my 17 years.  Well this evening seemed to be a turning point of my imagination for a  relationship with Karen, because later she wanted to clear some things, between me and her. This resulted in a telephone conversation for about nearly two hours. The only thing I can conclude from this session is that she is an ecological cunt, who thinks that she is something better than others.  One reason, which lets me conclude so is that a friend of her told me that Good-naturedness was the only reason why she talked to me.  Well I didn't knew that every person, who talks to me is just good natured. I don't think that conversation is a thing of Good-naturedness, because if so the world will get egoistically and it will become a privilege to talk to someone else.  Sorry but here it seems that sombebody stayed too long in the broad sunlight. Maybe she planted too many patches, which is what she does right at the moment :D  This is it for now, I hope you enjoyed reading this and I hope I could give you a small view of my life.

"I'm in a reflective mood today. I received a phone call this afternoon from the sister of my old neighbor, who I will call Alice. She had passed away this morning. Alice had been fighting terminal colon cancer since March and after harsh chemo therapy and a bout with pneumonia that landed her in the ICU, she decided that enough was enough. She stopped treatment just around the July 4th weekend. I'm not too exact on the details, but suffice it to say that she failed quickly after that and passed away in her sleep this morning surrounded by family and friends. She was only 52. As I struggle with Depression, AD/HD, tic disorders, sleep apnea, insomnia, food allergies, pollen allergies, and a weak immunity system I sometimes feel that life is unfair. I used to say that the Universe was out to get me, that God's having his little joke with me. I suppose it's only natural to feel that way. It's a full plate and I'm not too hungry for what's on the menu. Then I encounter other people with other hardships and I see that life itself is not fair to an awful lot of people. Life is, in fact, a lousy chef. What struck me as sad today, however, was not simply the passing of somebody I knew. Instead I was struck with my own mortality and weakness. Let me explain. Alice and some other neighbors hadn't been too kind to me when I moved into the area. They had accused me of various deviant behaviors that to this day still anger me. These were supposed to be my Christian brothers and sisters and instead they wielded stones. The rumors mounted as the months progressed, wilder and wilder, until they reached a crescendo where they became so outlandish that it was easy to disprove them. When all the furor amounted to nothing a lot of people were left with egg on their face. That summer several of the families involved moved away. I have unresolved issues with them, but with Alice, my neighbor, I was able to find forgiveness in my heart. The story didn't end happily there with us arm in arm, though. Alice never really apologized to me, though her behavior towards my family and myself became kinder. Unfortunately, she was one of the people I knew who didn't believe in AD/HD. One day she told me her opinion on the subject right to my face after I mentioned I had it. I was so stunned by her bold opinion that I stood there slack jawed. I swore that day I would never let that happen to me again. You see a bit of that fire in this blog whenever anybody accuses me of not having a ""real"" problem. I am as fierce in person as well. Thanks to Alice. And now she's passed on. Suddenly my anger feels petty and shallow. She moved away and now has died, but I allowed her to change me. I nursed a wound like an angry coal in my heart. I forgave her for one thing, but held a grudge for another. She became representative of all the doubters in my life and I used that as impetus for change. What type of person does that make me? On top of that, I have set lofty goals for myself that are proving hard to meet. Time is ticking and my 40th birthday is but a scant five months away. One of the byproducts of meeting those goals was to have a book with my name on it that I could bring into her elementary school classroom one day, slam on her desk, and say ""Ha!"" - as if my success would mean anything to her. As if that would prove my struggle with AD/HD was real. How silly. How foolish. Alice was only thirteen years older than I. I can blink and be 52 tomorrow. Mortality laughs at me and replaces all of life's menu items with sour grapes and rotten eggs. What shall I order now? Usually, my sense of humor keeps my spirits alight. Today, however, I see myself as being revealed as a small-minded man with insignificant goals. That even for a moment, no matter how miniscule, I was sad she died before my goals were met... This both sickens me and splashes me in the face with a brisk dose of reality. December looms and I read news? Time leaks through my fingers and I'm worried about a drop in comments on my blog? How did I get so turned around? Where did I get so terribly sidetracked? I need to remember what it is I want out of life. It is not to show up the doubters but to find joy in my own accomplishments. I know that, but negative thought attaches itself to our most noble intentions like a parasite. Allow it to stay too long and it consumes and replaces what was once good and uplifting. I don't resent Alice. I never wished her ill. But I regret I let myself hold a grudge, however slight it seemed. Life is too short for such things. So I will allow Alice to change me again.

"hi, I'm a 21 year-old male from the uk, over the past few months I have become increasingly depressed.  I'm always acting the joker and appear to be happy at university and work but every night I go to bed and hope that I won't wake up in the morning. For the past 3 or 4 years I've had an overwhelming feeling that I won't live very long and over the past few months I have the sensation that I will die very soon. my depression also leads me to get very angered.

"Today, my mother tried to commit suicide. Due to recent family events, it awakened childhood feelings of abandonment, inadequacy, and loneliness in my mom. She felt alone. Luckily, she was too coward to utilize her personal firearm. She chose to drink herself into an oblivion and inhale exhaust fumes.   The exhaust fumes made her tired, and in her tired stupor, she thought she could sit outside and freeze to death. She had a bottle of heart pressure medication as a backup. I thank my lucky stars that she fell asleep in the grass instead. Her attempt was unsuccessful.  Originally I blamed myself for having been hard on her. I have always been honest with my mother, and she has always kept a strong face. But today I learned how fragile she truly is.   I take it upon myself to protect her, and support her, no matter what. She raised me and continues to raise my younger siblings. It’s time that we give back.   I have been thankful that I have not suffered the loss of someone I love to suicide. I thought that I would see the signs if it were going to happen. I didn’t. I will be more aware and I will show my love for people I care about. I often think about the ones I love but don’t take the time to reach out.   That changes today. I refuse to hold back my love for fear of being hurt and pushed away, for the people I love are not hearing it enough but still stay.  I am grateful for the second chance with my mother. I have thought often about missing her someday when she dies. I never thought that it might come so soon. I am renewed and reborn. My goals and ambitions stronger than ever.  My love for my family renewed in the wake of our war. My mother the warrior on the front lines, taking the shots from sibling to sibling and softening the blow so we all can continue the crusade.  This will change.

"My family is a disaster Hello, I'm a 17 year old girl, and I'm tired of living.  My father and my mother hate each other deeply, my father works and my mother is a housewife, recently they divorced, and both want custody of me and my siblings.  My father constantly says that my mom steals money from him (he stills has to mantain us and her), and that she is a bad person that the only thing that wants is the house where we live in. My mother says that he never gives her anything (yet we live very well because he takes care of us all the time) and that when she doesn't have money for making lunch is because he didn't gave her the money and that he is making us believe that she is bad just so we go with him. I don't know who to believe I love them both.  On the other hand, my father is always scolding us because of my little sister, who is always treating us badly, but when we deffend from her she is the victim. Today she told my father everything about the secrets I told her, about how sometimes I want to die, and all the thoughts I trust her, she just told them because we were having a little fight, I couldn't even tell hers because I didn't dare to. My father ended up scolding me and saying I don't value anything, and that I should stop being such an awful person, that I was one of those woman who everyone hates, just because I decided to deffend myself from her, and that SHE was the one being treated badly. My dad says always such hurtful things to me, he says that a career in music is useless and he isn't going to cost it, but when I told him I wanted to work to have my own money he just didn't let me... I want to be independent so I don't have to respect him all the time, I want to have my life, I want to be happy away from here, even if it mean not having much money, as long as I have music everything will be okay, is the only thing that calms me.  I love my mother, even though too religious and hates my music, she is loving and she always says that if she had money she would pay any career I wanted, and even though my father is very cruel sometimes and wants me to study law, I love him too, I don't know how to get away from here, if I can't I don't know what should I do, who should I choose.  I want to work and stop being obedient and afraid of my dad, everytime I think about how can I tell him that I don't agree with what he's doing I'm afraid, because he is the one giving me everything I have. He yells at me when I deffend myself from my sister, when I told him I wasn't going to stop listening to metal he yelled at me, also when I tell him that I won't stop loving music. He thinks he is untouchable, that everything he says is the right way, and that if I don't calm down then he will treat me even worst.

"Life is so fucking bullshit You think your family cares about you and would do anything to help you, but that's a fucking lie. Both my parents said they went through a ""deep depression"" that was as bad or worse than mine when they were my age, yet they show 0 interest or care in helping me. I have a sore throat? Oh Jesus go to the walk-in clinic immediately! I say I'm extremely depressed and feel no happiness anymore? Oh yeah we can totally fix that by having a talk every 3 months with you when you have a mental breakdown. I feel like they want me to die since they don't give a flying fuck about my mental state, and when we talk about it they just say shit like I have to be more positive. I've started working out again last week, something I couldn't do for almost a year due to being injured, and I feel nothing from it. I used to love working out so much but now it feels like something that betrayed me, as I'm always gonna be doomed to be skinny because I'm too depressed to have an appetite to eat enough.

" Well I finally got around to trying out this blogger- even though I've had the google toobar for ages, *and* was a loyal googler long before that.  Silly me.  I first tried to blog with a different blogger site, and To Tell You The Truth, I didn't like the feel.  Oh, it was simple enough, if awkward, but the 'home' page of the blogging site was so darn busy I felt lost there.     This place is so much better. I should have gone with what I knew was a tried and true service.  Anyways, this is my dumping ground.  Stuff I find on the internet that I must squawk about (good and bad), late night frustrations and nightmares, and the occasional proud parenting moment (or self flaggellation over same)-- all will be posted here so I can embarrass my family and bore strangers.

"I'm 25 years old single black mother and I've been struggling with depression ever since I was a small girl. Throughout the course of my life I have had a lot of share of ups and downs: parents divorced in 1985, father was on drugs, domestic abuse, severe teasing, idiotic boyfriends and the list goes on. If there were problems in the home, you dealt with it at home and kept your mouth shut tight. There is no such thing as a black woman being depressed. Black women MUST keep this aura of being strong, independent, swallow your tears, raise your children, take the blows that life throws at you and keep moving with the beat. If you didn't keep moving with the beat, then you will fall through the cracks; everyone sees it and you will be considered as weak and no one will want to deal with you. Everyone around you will let you have it and you will be labeled as an outcast among your fellow black sisters and brothers. I have had a few suicide attempts and my family thought that I was just trying to get sheer childish attention as to say, ""I'm a big baby, pay attention to me."" They took it as a joke and it broke my spirit down to a trillion pieces. I constantly worried what my friends, co-workers, class mates, and lovers would see me as a walking disaster waiting to happen. At the time, I did a good job of ""covering it up"" for a long time. It painfully and slowly came out. I was afraid that if I told some one that I was severely depressed, I would not get the love, support, and care that I needed: family labeled me as ""CRAZY"". So if you have any comments please feel free to let me know what you think about black women and depression.",1,year old single black mother struggling depression small girl course life lot share ups down parent divorced father drug domestic abuse severe teasing idiotic boyfriend list go on problem home dealt home kept mouth shut tight thing black woman depressed black woman aura strong independent swallow tear raise child blow life throw moving beat did not moving beat fall crack see considered weak want deal you let labeled outcast fellow black sister brother suicide attempt family thought just trying sheer childish attention say i big baby pay attention me took joke broke spirit trillion piece constantly worried friend coworkers class mate lover walking disaster waiting happen time did good job covering up long time painfully slowly came out afraid told severely depressed not love support care needed family labeled crazy comment feel free let know think black woman depression
" i think i have a fairly violent and destructive nature, the other day i saw a work line of ants crossing this little path in my garden, you know all in a little line carrying leaves and other small pieces of debris to there nest.   so i decided- without conscious control or empirical decision making- to follow the line and find this magical nest of ants and well, to destroy them. its not as if im a child still so there was no real explorative adventure kiddy stuff, just the pleasure of destroying their city.  so i went to the garage- found a high pressure vacuum suction hose attachment and pressurised some diesel fuel into there home, i was quite surprised as about a gallon went in, along with a flaming book of matches- and i threw a bible in just for good measure- good kindling really, nice thin pages. anyway so this massive jet of fire shoots out and almost cooks me, and the most satisfying part was that NO ants came back out, i let the ones working in the chain across the path live just so they could go and tell the other colonies what had happened.  i was quite disturbed by the enjoyment i got out of the whole thing, but well the world is full of wierdo's that do a lot more worse stuff, so im ok, right?

"My doctor diagnosed me with depression (mild form) possibly situational. I have been off work for the past month as a result of a culmination of stressful events over the past year or so. Such as my husband's alcoholism, having a child (she is 18 months now) and returning to work. My doctor put me on Effexor 37.5 mg which has since increased to 75 mg.

" My opinion on peoples   faith   is   different  . I dont think that anyone can determine how much faith someone has, and I dont think that other people should   judge   someone elses faith. God is apart of   everyone's life   one way or another.   Mostly   everyone knows who God is and the principles behind Him. I think that the way that people   deny   Christ's name so easily is  wrong , but Im not them, so I cant make their decisions for them. But what I can do, is I can work my hardest to be a Godly   example   so that they can see what the Christian life is all about. Being a Christian   isnt   always   fun  . Yes, there are always the occansionally   disappointment   that we run into and from what I have heard, alot of people   blame God   for their   mishaps  . Well, as hard as this might sound, its all apart of God's   master plan  . God allows some misfortunes to happen, to   test   your level of faith that you might have in Him.   BUT  , know this, God will   never   test you with more than you can   handle  .  Beliving in  Christianity  or  Evolution . Either one that you believe in  requires   faith!

I hate it when guys are not able to act themselves if there is something between us. How immature is that...really. Then if a guy has a grudge against a girl I can't stand it how they center their lives around it and try to get back at them by getting on other girls and stuff. Once again that just proves they are immature and obviously don't know what they are doing.

"Where did I go wrong? Let me apologize by the rather lengthy post:  I’m not sure where to start. Recently, I’ve been having trouble with my friends and I’m not sure why. I had a childhood friend since Elementary school, we would hang out often and now she’s a stranger. She would say she was busy, but the last day I texted her, my dad had kidney surgery because he had cancer in his kidney. They removed the whole kidney and the day he got home, I texted my childhood friend that he was home and he was doing okay. She couldn’t even take one second to respond “I’m glad your dad is okay?” That was it for me, I had to remove her on Facebook after she had to replied after a week, two weeks, etc. and I believe I deleted all messages on my cell phone, and I’m not sure what happened ! Then this “friend” of mine, never messages me on either Instagram  or Facebook. I think it began when I told her I asked out one of her friends a year ago (we are still friends, the girl I asked out), and from then she started not to respond to me. So, recently I told my friend who I asked out, about the communication between me and her friend. She told me that her friend, (who is also her roommate)  that they’re both extremely busy, which I understand, but and that “she” loves me, and doesn’t hate me (my friend who doesn’t respond, and not love in a boyfriend way.) But, if this is the case why doesn’t she communicate with me online? Even when I see her, she waved hi to me and we talk a bit, but it’s not the same.

"My long-term relationship ended without a breakup conversation. My bf just ghosted me and stopped talking to me without any explanation. I’m feeling very depressed and need some advice? I (22/f) found out through Instagram that my long-term bf (23/m) was cheating on me with multiple women. I’ve noticed the last month together he’s been distant and acting strangely. Now all his strange behavior makes sense.   After I found out I texted him letting him know that I found out about the cheating and that I lost all respect for him. He didn’t even bother responding or giving me a call. There was no text back, no phone call back. Zero conversation. I sent the text a week ago.   I loved him so much and I can’t believe after all this time together he is just going to ghost me and leave me without a final conversation. Him ignoring me is so awful and selfish and is mind-boggling to me. I went ahead and deleted his number and deleted him off social media.   Moving forward, how can I feel better about the whole situation? I feel sick to my stomach and absolutely awful.

"Told my mother I tried to kill myself, she admitted she also tried when i was a baby. I've been struggling with this  sickness for a while, it cost me my job, and a few friends, but only now i can publicly say that i tried to kill myself on the 19th of February. I tried to hang myself with a belt, fortunatelly i bought a really shitty one at primark and the only thing it did was leave me on the floor gasping desperatelly for air, filled with a sense of failure and a huge shame. I've always been an outgoing, funny, talkative and very active guy and i just felt as is i runned out of batery like something was leaving me without lifeforce.  After some therapy i decided to tell my mother about this. I went for a visit to my parents house and waited until we were alone to tell her basically what i've been writing above. Also told her that the biggest fear i had before doing it was that if i died my mother would also died just out of pure sadness. After we both cried for a while she dropped the bomb.  She had been struggling with depression all her life without me or my sister knowing about it and it came a point where she even tried of doing the same. The thing that stopped her was their children and what we would do with 12 and 8 years alone. She also told me that my grandfather didn't die of cancer, apparently he was an alcoholic, and when we where kids he threw himself at the well they had on the backyard.  All this just made me realize that people don't kill themselves, depression kills people the same way cancer does. People who haven't struggled with this can't even imagine what is living with depression and often blame a person who is basically ill.   My mother also gave me the best advice i've ever recieved. She told me that I wasn't on this earth just to find a job and live the best way i could just by buying things, that it didn't matter if i didn't find a huge reason to live; just by being there i was already the reason for my mother and many others to live and be happy,  the same way she was for me. That even just by smiling at the guy at the supermarket i was already making him a bit happier even though it would only be a few seconds, and that should be enough.

We talked and talked and talked for 2 hours and 30 minutes. We are just normal friends. We talked bout unique names for her kids (Zanique, Danielle, Cyclice / Celynn) and she commented a few for me (I Lai, He Lai, She Lai, They Lai, We Lai, It Lai). Both of us were just plain talking. It's hard to find someone that you can click to in just a short while. Plus, we did more than just click. We were close, quite close friends already.  Her boyfriend's coming back tomorrow.

"Getting to Know a Stranger A Human Thesis w/ a Photography Minor Getting to Know a Stranger!  A Human Thesis w/ a Photography Minor  Getting to Know a Stranger is a human project looking to get to know someones life by giving an hour (I always encourage it to go longer) to Getting to Know Stranger that other wise I would have never met. There is no monetary exchange only one of friendship and kindness. I would like to document our meeting with a few candid photos only if you are comfortable, if not, a conversation does the trick!   Getting to Know a Stranger is all inclusive and strives to get to know all walks of life. I welcome all ages, gender identities, races, religious views, economic status.…. you know every type of Human!   I know that in my own life I have felt extremely alone and isolated in my own mind many times, and have felt that there is NO one who understands what I am going through. What I started to notice was through my own travels and tribulations I have noticed one thing, we are all a lot a alike, and most of the time share a more relatable story then anyone in my inner circle. In todays technology the human interaction is becoming less and less human and more and more digitized. Screen watching instead of people watching, direct messaging instead of a hand written letter are methods of detachment driving a wedge between our true selves and the human being sitting across from us.  So how do I make a change in my own life toward fighting this black hole of being digitally programmed, force fed fear, and made too wallow in my insecurities. Get out there and meet people of walks of life and commit an hour of my time each day to an individual who could use a human interaction.   A little about me!       My name is Aaron Bistrin I am a 28 year old guy from Santa Cruz California, a beautiful place to grow up. However it wasn't always easy growing, Santa Cruz can be a tricky place to navigate as youth and I found myself in quite a bit of trouble very young.  This continued into my early 20’s and after a series of life changing events I started to make some serious changes in my life. As one positive lead to another, I found myself opening a restaurant in my home town at the age of 25. Fast forward a few years and I have found myself out of the restaurant industry and creating an alternative marketing company with my best friend. This is where I found my love for photography and content creation. My passion for human interaction and learning about people has been inherit nature since I was a child. I feel when meeting strangers our filters are down, there are no pre programmed family/community paradigms, is this not the best opportunity to be your true self? So what better than combine my two passions of photography and human interaction into a Human Thesis with a Photography Minor. Getting to Know a Stranger.   If you or someone you know could use a kind interaction by Getting to Know a Stranger, please comment below or shoot me an email at abistrin@yahoo.com. All meeting are private unless the consent from both people is given. This is a project of human kindness. Hope to meet you soon!  Much love!

"Friend leads much better life, I feel resentful We both just graduated, she had so many job offers,  I had none save for an internship. I found a job later but I make less than half of what she makes. She got a job offer from another firm, and referred me to them when she turned them down, but I didn't get it even though the interview went great. And because she makes so much more than I do, she's always trying to get me to travel, which I can't afford since I'm saving up for grad school.  She's also currently in a relationship, and has tried to set me up with people but it never works.   She's a great friend but she makes me feel so inadequate. I'm begining to become resentful and envious, and I don't want to be a toxic person to be around. It's getting hard for me to hear about her achievements while I have nothing to compare, how shitty of a person would I be if I distanced myself from her for my own mental well-being?

"Advice for getting back in touch with everyday life? I think the hardest thing for me, and the largest factor I need to address to try and feel healthy again, is simply trying to feel engaged in and enjoying the present. Right now, days have little to no meaning at all, and I am only really able to think of my life in terms of weeks, months, and years. As a result of that, I feel nothing from the hobbies or moments that would before provide me feelings of joy, satisfaction or just generally fulfilling myself. The only activities I really ""enjoy"" anymore is anything that provides me with a complete escape from reality, however these activities are not exactly one belonging to a healthy lifestyle.  I just want to enjoy the things that I used to enjoy, but whenever I try I feel like I am wasting my time, are not doing them well enough. Has anybody gone through something similar, and has advice for how they managed to get through it?

"I've never talked about this to anyone I've struggled with depression since I was in 2nd grade. For the last 7 years it's gotten worst, I'm 20 at the moment. When I was 13 I was raped occasionally. Being raped when it first happen didn't bother me as much because I didnt understand what was happening until years later. What did bother me at the time was that I felt alone. I've always felt alone, never felt like anyone cared for me or about me. I fought with my mom and step dad a lot which made me feel even more lonely. I never talked about feeling lonely to anyone because I was always embarrassed about it and still do. Because me and my parents had a rocky relationship I would be abused by both at times. One time I was arguing with my mom and she ended up getting a 2 by 4 and started hitting me with it. I never rasied my hands at my parents, just talked a lot of shit and was an asshole to them. My parents kicked me out of their house when I was 14. I ended up living with my grandpa. This made me feel unwanted and even more lonely now that my parents gave up on me. I lived with my grandpa for about 9 months before he sent me back to my parents because he couldn't ""afford"" to keep me. I wasn't an asshole to my grandpa nor was I mean to him, I just was a teen who stayed up late and took long showers. My grandpa giving up on me was heartbreaking for me. I felt like no one wanted me and if I ended everything then everything would be better. I didn't even last a week at my parents house, they shipped me off to live with some family who lived in the rural country area instead of the city. I lived there for maybe 4 months and finished my freshmen year of high school there. I didn't feel welcomed anywhere I went and for the most part I felt more beyond alone. Majority of the time at my uncle's I was in my room, alone and desperate for a friend. After 4 lonely months of really being alone I was given back to my parents again. After coming home broken I learned to keep to myself. No one wanted me and no one cared.   When I got back home I was sent to an all boy high school. Once again I had to go to a new school and try to fit in somehow. I was lonely for a while until I met this girl. I'm afraid to write her name incase she ever reads this and it hurts reading/writing it but I need to get this off my chest. I met this beautiful girl named Cindy at a school function. She went to the all girl school down a couple streets. Both all gender schools would make events for each other to get students that social interaction. Anyways I meet this beautiful girl named Cindy, she was nice to me and I was nice to her. We dated for over a year and while it lasted it was nice. The way she broke up with me literally broke me. I was having a really sad day and told her about how I struggle with really bad depression and that I have suicidal thoughts. Her response was ""oh"" and she slowly stopped talking to me. Eventually she stopped talking to me and when she did talk to me she made excuses about not having time to talk to me. She was my only friend, the only person I was close to. She couldn't be there for me when I needed her most, when I needed a friend most. So I stayed alone thinking maybe school was too much for her at the moment. Then one day I get on Facebook only to see her on it, I clicked on her page and saw that she had been on hanging out with friends and having the time of her life. She slowly broke me, I couldn't handle it and called her to confront her about it. She made excuses and talked about how she didnt have time for me at the moment, so she hung up and left it alone. I was reaching my breaking point, I was going to commit suicide. I sent her a text message talking about how I needed her to talk to me and be a friend because I was getting worst. She never responded to me however she did get in contact with my school to let them know what I was dealing with.   I was so embarrassed that she did this to me, I felt betrayed and hurt that she made me the schools problem instead of hers. It hurt ne so bad. I was embarrassed that the school knew, I was embarrassed that my parents knew now. I wanted to kill myself more than ever now. I was so hurt by this and was angry at Cindy. I went home and tried stabbing myself. My mom went in my room to talk to me, just so happened at that moment I had a kitchen knife in my hand to stab myself. My mon fought me over it and sent me to a psychiatric hospital. I stayed there until December 23rd. At the hospital I tried killing myself twice. First time was when the guards/residents give you cracks, I ate the crackers but stuffed the wrapper down my throat. One if the residents heard me making choking nosies and came in to save me. Second time was when I started swallowing my food instead of chewing on it to choke me out again. They put me on these medications that didn't help but I acted like they did so I can go home. I was alone again, Cindy stopped talking to me. It broke my heart and broke me.   It's been 4 years since Cindy and I'm not over it. It still kills me about what happened. I'm still depressed and suicidal. I honestly wish I did kill myself when I had the courage to do so. There hasn't been much for me other than pain. I haven't moved on and I haven't gotten over everything. This was my deepest darkest moment in my life so far. I wish I could say things got better for me since all of that but true is they haven't. I'm still the same lonely person I've always felt I've been for the longest time. I've tried dating in college and I've never had feelings for anyone.

" i was just watching apocalypse now and ive realised that napalm is your friend, your very best friend, and she will care for you- she just wants your soul first, here's how to make her:  the last time i made it, mine was very basic- 1 part gasoline to 2 parts animal blood. This solidified into a type of gel, not very stable ( a bit like me) but lethally flammable and sticky.  But a revised method is to pour some gasoline into an old container and force it to eat up styrofoam-you can even use the little white balls from the inside of a bean bag- untill it wont take anymore, this dries into a form of foam itself, with a wet slice at the bottom, tie some into a soggy ball and wrap with cling film to seal it and you have a perfect pocket rocket for throwing into a car window or something else that wants to burn, you could even hook up a basic fuse into it and run away, very fast indeed, because if you have tied the cling film on tightly enough it will just explode big time, superb.

"Bad Stepmom? I was married for 17 years to a man who refused to work and who sat and watched TV all day. I divorced him to find a better situation. I married my current husband on Sept 1, 2017. On 10/6/17 he lost his job. Now I feel as if I'm back where I started. I have to pay for everything. On top of it, he invited his 18-year-old daughter to move in with us without asking me, even though I'm paying for everything. Suddenly I'm paying for her groceries and everything else on top of his. Then, I'm informed by my husband that his daughter's boyfriend is going to spend every weekend here: Friday night through Sunday afternoon. Now I'm feeding him too. To make matters worse, the daughter and her boyfriend are loud and inconsiderate. They leave messes in the kitchen, living room, her room, etc. I miss my quiet house. Paying for him and I is more than enough. Am I selfish to not want to support her and her boyfriend too? I have a house in a different city but he refused to move there because my young adult kids live there. So I have to pay for 2 households because he refuses to move there, yet I have to live with his daughter. I'm about ready to run back home to my other house and call this quits.

 Hey how is everyone. Heather has moved here and we are doing really well. We  spent 17 hours in the car this past weekend going to my friend Jared's  wedding and we will be going to Jessica's wedding theis weekend. we haven't  killed each other so that is really impressive. I am a little tense about  the wedding but I guess that is good otherwise I would probably be terrible.  I guess I still might.  Heather is doing really well.  She has been handling the move well even though I know she misses her  friends back in Colorado.  I am considering taking a Youth Ministry position at Fellowship of the  Metroplex. It is a fairly large church wich I am not a big fan of but I am  praying over with Heather and we need your prayers to help us with the  decision. We are also considering some other options of ministry and would  appreciate your prayers. Thanks for everyone's help and support.

"Hello everyone. I'm here because I'm starting to have doubts about my mental health... First off I'm a 21 year old male college student, and up until about 2 years ago I think I've been fine...but lately I'm not so sure. For one thing I can't seem to concentrate or focus on ANYTHING anymore and it's becoming very frustrating. I find myself daydreaming or pacing only minutes after I sat down to do something important and because of it I can't get anything done. I can't even focus on things that should be fun, or the things I used to be dedicated too. I've also become very philosophical. I always find myself spending a lot of time thinking about life and death, the nature of existence, etc...But it seems like its becoming an obsession. I always feel like I'm wasting time but I can't bring myself to do anything constructive. Sometimes I'm disgusted when I realize how much time I spend simply pacing back and forth. I also can't fall asleep at night anymore...I just lie awake thinking and I can't make it stop. I also have constant fears about becoming old and having regrets about how I lived and what I accomplished. I also have constant regrets about the past. It seems like there's nothing I can do in life to satisfy myself and it driving me crazy...especially because for all the ambition I have I have no motivation whatsoever anymore. Also it's hard to explain, but I get the feeling that I can't feel life, if that makes any sense? It's like time is moving so fast that I can't even realize it.  Anyway, I was never like this before and I have no reason to be like this now. I don't have relationship problems or family problems and I'm not religious. This all just came out of nowhere with no apparent cause. Basically it has come to the point where I know something is wrong with me but I don't know what. I've kept telling myself this is nothing but its getting more intense and now I feel like I'm spiraling into a void or something. I guess I'm simply here to seek some opinions on what my problem could be. Thanks a lot for taking the time. PS I may have posted this in the wrong place but its my first post so I'm not sure...",1,hello everyone starting doubt mental health year old male college student year ago think finebut lately not sure thing concentrate focus anymore frustrating daydreaming pacing minute sat important done focus thing fun thing used dedicated too philosophical spending lot time thinking life death nature existence etcbut like obsession feel like wasting time bring constructive disgusted realize time spend simply pacing forth fall asleep night anymorei just lie awake thinking make stop constant fear old having regret lived accomplished constant regret past like life satisfy driving crazyespecially ambition motivation whatsoever anymore hard explain feeling feel life make sense like time moving fast realize it anyway like reason like now not relationship problem family problem not religious just came apparent cause basically come point know wrong not know what kept telling getting intense feel like spiraling void something guess simply seek opinion problem be thanks lot taking time p posted wrong place post not sure
"Annoyed and I feel absolutely horrible about it My parents have recently recovered from some financial issues that caused them to move out of state. A little over a year ago, my father found a job back in the state where I currently live and has been staying at my place during the weeks when he works. As much as I love my parents though, sometimes I really struggle with sharing my limited space, i.e. a very small one bedroom apartment.   What makes it even more difficult is the fact that I rarely ever know ahead of time when he's coming and when he isn't. And when he does come, he doesn't knock. He just walks right in using the spare key that I came home to find was gone (without first being asked if it was okay to take) a while back.   It honestly makes me feel like I'm twelve again. I worked very hard to become independent and to have my own life and space and now... I don't. I hadn't even been on my own for a year when all of this started.   I can't say anything about it because my mother always downplays it by saying, ""You'll be fine. We're family."" And the one time I even indirectly said something to my father, just by casually asking if he'd taken my spare key, I got a phone call from my mother saying that he was upset and essentially blamed me for them having to move to begin with.   Long story short, I don't know what to do. I feel so terrible to be annoyed with the situation, but I am.

"Having troubles reconnecting with an old friend. Aloha Reddit. So I'm a guy and I'm trying to reconnect with an old female friend of mine. Long story short, she stopped talking to me and then I stopped talking to her but she thought I was the one who stopped talking to her and so we ignored eachother for three years even though we go to the same school. Recently, I texted her saying that I apologize. She said that she'd give me a second chance, so I start texting her questions to get to know her again, but she takes hours to answer and when she does answer, all she says is ""Yes/no, you?"" When I ask her a question and ""Haha ok"" when I answer my own question. She even leaves me on read sometimes. Should I stop texting her? I really don't understand why she decided to give me a second chance if she won't even try to support the conversation. Just saying ""Sorry, I don't wanna talk to you anymore"" would've been a lot less painful.",0,having trouble reconnecting old friend aloha reddit guy trying reconnect old female friend mine long story short stopped talking stopped talking thought stopped talking ignored eachother year school recently texted saying apologize said second chance start texting question know again take hour answer doe answer say yesno you ask question haha ok answer question leaf read sometimes stop texting her really not understand decided second chance not try support conversation just saying sorry not wanna talk anymore lot painful

I point my finger of shame at J for telling me that I can be pushy when I choose to be, my ‘so-called’ dedicated lecturer who was supposed to provide me with the information on the 2 important major courses I’m taking this semester so as not to land myself with another super stupid C+ and the entire family of Hitz FM for playing all the wrong songs at the wrong time.   I find the following people and creatures guilty of conspiracy to inflict misery upon me: my handphone for giving me trouble in typing texts, the taxi drivers for repeatedly taking the wrong routes when I repeatedly with my sweet looking face telling them, “Please take the Pusat Sains Negara route and turn into your right after the traffic light”, my missing brown sandals for not showing up although it has been nearly two weeks now, my totally chubby legs and most of all the boy bands in general for their I-can’t sing-but-thanks-to-my-good looks-performances…   I positively loathe men who approach the forever-so-romantic-in-the-head-women with their you-are-so-beautiful-pick up lines in order to get into their pants!!!

"Sick of rejection Met someone on an app we seemed to click and talked all night till like 4am, same the next night and the night after that etc. Honestly for the first time in ages I thought Id done it and found someone who liked me aswell and we could hang out and have some fun, even just over the summer Id have been happy with that.   After more talking we met, we drove round and spent a few hours just chilling and talking it was fun but something wasnt right. I have these little games I play to kind of 'test the waters', nothing creepy just some fun light flirting like a play full punch to the arm or lean myself a bit closer in watching a video or something, harmless stuff but the reactions tell you the story. Long story short it wasnt the story I was hoping for, nothing was reciprocated and there was just no positive body language (I know im sounding like some sort of socially awkward overly analytical weirdo here but trust me its just the best way I can describe it over text).  So it gets to nearly 11 he starts yawning talking about being up for work, fair enough weve been out 4 hours so I drop him home, says text me when you get back so I do and sure enough the generic one word 'haha' responses start and that was it.  The thing is its not the first time, it happens all the time, I rarely find anyone who actually has proper chat with me (always just 'fuck now dude?' or that type of crap) so I start getting feelings and they seem to like me, we meet and it all seems to fall apart aftwerwards. Your just gonna have to trust me that im not creepy, I dont make sexual advances, I can hold convo, make people laugh, everyone always seems happy to spend a good few hours with me and not want to go home yet when they do it all comes crashing down.

I choose to believe there’s nothing after we die; no afterlife, no heaven or hell, no reincarnation, or godly ascension. Just a beautiful, peaceful nothing. And it just seems so much better than being alive.   When you’re alive, you feel so much. Yes, there’s happiness, excitement, surprise, love. But there’s also sadness, anger, hate, jealousy. Why would I chose to bare such things when death can provide none of these things? All the “good stuff” about living doesn’t weigh out the bad, in my head.

"Realising your mental state and life is unfixable sucks Just started to realise this. Been working my way to suicide last year but it didn't work out.    So I'm trying my best (how ironic) to just feed myself everyday, and not letting my emotions burden the ones I love (or any person I come across). Basically just existing plainly.   I really wished I could show affection to those I love and care about. But I realise that without any qualities as a person, I'm better off just not being a nuisance and a liability.   Feeling lonely sucks. I wished I feel loved by those whom I love. But staying away (while not killing myself)  is my only way to protect them from myself.   Oh well. Thanks for listening.

"My name is Maria, I'm 37 and have social anxiety plus some traits of borderline personality disorder.  I've been taking Prozac for the last eight years and have been seeing a psychiatrist that whole time.  Next week I have an appointment with a therapist (I have only had random therapy sessions during this time).  What I'm really struggling with right now is how I am still single after all these years.  I'll go out with someone about a half a dozen times and then they lose interest, or as the last person said, I freaked him out (really I think he overreacted to a couple of incidents, but I guess if he was freaked out, who am I to argue?)  In 2002 my best friend / ex died in my condo from years of drug / alcohol abuse ... he was going through a rough period at the time, but I really think we would have ended up together .... since then I have had a hard time connecting with anyone else on the same level.  Does anyone else find that people they date are scared off?  Every time someone breaks it off with me, I get very discouraged and that much more ""jaded"" ... with this last person, I even took a day off from work.  Anyone else go through this?

" Why, hello there. Is it normally this difficult to start one of these things? I'm trying not to plunge into a sea of various results of hallucinogenics straight away, so instead I'm going to approach the problem of how I'm going to start this thing off... But I guess I already have !! Well, that was easy !!  I suppose I should introduce myself. Hi, I'm Laura. *shakes hand* I'm thirteen, and I live in a large town (or small city. But hey, the glass is half full) called Livingston, which is in Scotland, located near the capital. I was born on the 29th of September 1990, which makes me a Libra (the most utterly boring sign in the zodiac).  I go to a Catholic high school (St. Margarets R.C. Academy) which I like to refer to as ""The Convent."" I am, in fact, a baptised Catholic, although I wouldn't say that was my religion as I don't practice it (unless that couple of times that I picked up the Bible when I was in a 'contradicting everyone' mood counts...). Actually, you could say that me and God have some issues to work out. I suppose you could call me an Atheist, although I did mess about with Magik for a while...  This is like my seventh attempt at a diary, as I just seem to start them, get bored and then move on to start another one. But, as you are my diary, you are required to have a name (See? At least the Diary of Anne Frank inspired me in SOME way).  And you shall be called... Tai. I like that name, I got it off of Rhyan, who wants me to me called Tai when I become a transexual. Personally I'd rather be named Bert. That's a masculine name. I tried to look up Tai on a names and meanings website, to enlighten myself onh the wisdom behind it. This is my result:  Name: Tai Origin: Chinese Meaning: 'Very big'  ...That'll do me. *wink*  Hum. Isn't it ironic how I have just spent about an hour setting up this account and fixing my profile to look all nice, and when I start writing my first ever entry... I get writers block. Oh, speaking of irony, my friend Sian and I were in Bathgate on Monday, and as we were walking to the chippie an NHS van drove past us... and the driver was smoking.   ...Well this seems like a sufficient introduction, so I'm away laughing on a fast camel.

"my parents created me and ruined me my mother got pregnant with me just before she turned 15 and has always lived in a bad environment this lead to her using drugs and misusing alcohol. my father is 4 years older then my mother so he was 19 when my mother got pregnant. none of this is a problem other then my mothers bad choices. my parents split up when I was a baby and so growing up I was fed lies about both my life became a contest of who id love the most. lots of other things happen around the time I turn 10 and I then I started to live with my father and my three half brothers where taken away. my father never really did anything to help me cope with the separation and my mother has ran away by the time I found out. for the last 5 years my mother would occasionally contact me and talk about how things will change but nothing ever did.  within the second year of me living with my father him and his wife decide to have a baby this happens and I get a new brother  who I am extremely attached to and love so much. This was fine until I was being neglected and cast out by my stepmother because I'm not her child and she didn't want me in the first place, she was just to desperate not to lose my father. so now that they have a baby things go her way a lot more. ( none of my family on my fathers side like my stepmother as she had a much better childhood and has become very stuck up from it ) I then stop spending as much time with them as I began to feel unwanted and my father has now become a very angry and belittling man who is uninterested in anything other than his laptop and phone. they began punishing me harshly for small things and neglecting my needs for example feeding me. because I had to earn my money to buy my own food if I didn't do everything they asked they wouldn't give me the money I needed to eat. so when I was 14 I started to lose weight as i had recently  met a boy that I liked and we would go for walks  and the obvious reason was that I couldn't afford to eat everyday but I did as my grandmother was secretly feeding me and giving me everything I needed and wanted as she noticed that I wasn't getting it. because my father and his wife are both very large people and visibly overweight they became angry that I was losing weight. they would regularly humiliate me in front of my relatives saying that I'm starving myself ( I wasn't I just really liked my now boyfriend and he enjoys walking)  the older I got the worse it become until it got to  my 16th birthday where it had gotten to the point they had gotten me my provisional driving licence and the cbt lesson so I can get a moped. this may seem nice but up until this point my birthday was just a garneted meal for me. they had also told my family to only give me money which they have taken and refused to give back no this day. their motive for doing this for me was so I had transport to the job they where forcing me to get so I had to start paying rent for my room.(my room is the place where things my father has that she doesn't like goes. this wasn't a problem to me as my father spends more money than he has on some really cool stuff) also useful information they claim money for me and have never told me this so they would also make me earn everything that I had and most of the things I had I paid for myself with the money I earned by doing everything they didn't want to do like pick my brother up from his school when he started going to the school playgroup. the only thing I didn't pay for was my phone.  when I was 15 I became qualified to look after children so they decided to misuse this and make me look after my brother more than I would have liked coz it took time away from my social life and school work. they would promise to pay for my time but they never did and in fear I would be punished and made to do more work without pay I didn't say anything.  on the day of my cbt my stepmother dropped me there and then left to go see her family for the rest of the day. this is fine but I unfortunately couldn't do the practical text which was driving on the road so they sent me home early. I was stranded in a town that was very far  from the town I live in and had nobody to come get me. but luckily I found my friend shopping in the town with her brother and I went home with them. while on the way home I had text my stepmother explaining I wasn't ready to do the practical test, as it was too dangerous because I couldn't control the bike well enough to drive on a road safely. a few minuets later my father begins texting me angrily saying that ive wasted their money and to get a job ad pay for everything myself because I had apparently refused to get on the bike and just left the lesson. because of this I got home and packed a bag and went to my mothers parents house to stay and I had no intention of ever going back to live with my father and still don't as it has been 5 months since I left. when I first left I stayed at my mothers parents house which was two towns away from where my father lives. that only lasted for a night though and in that space of time he had come there to see me and bring me my phone as I had left it ( he had a tracking devise on it so he always new where I was) and has started texting me on my Facebook saying that I am just like my mother and lots of other horrible things like I'm on drugs and pregnant and that I'm a slut and he also said he was going to get my boyfriend arrested. within a week I lived in the same town as my father as I still have to attend school but I am still refusing to go back I now live with my grandmother ( fathers mother ) and occasionally live at my boyfriends house for a week or so depending how I feel .  within these last two months I have been in contact with social services as I want my things and money back and I also want contact with my brother but I don't want my father or his wife  to be present during the contact as I want nothing to do with them .  last week I went there with my friends that have been helping me through the satiation of seeing my brother and his wife made him tell us to get out and them when I decided to leave she slammed the door on us at first then came out saying I'm not aloud to see him again. during this time I have found out that my father has lied to me about things all my life for example he always told me that he didn't know how old my mother was. this was proven to be a lie as my mother now lives not to fa away from me as she just got out of prison and she and others have told me about how my father attended her 16th birthday party and by then she was pregnant . I know am extremely confused about trusting people and have developed some sort of mental illness that my doctor has ignored to help me with. I'm now experiencing depressive and hyperactive episodes and will tend to black out and forget thing that have happened during long  amounts of time . I don't know how to handle this situation can someone please give me advice on getting help and moving on with my life.

"Hi, after 2 posts on the DF I'm finally beginning to work out the format. Excuse the typo's as going through Prozac withdrawals and kind of shaky! I'm 27 years old, I live in the UK, Studied psychology, trained psychiatric nurse, behavior family therapist, and trainee CB therapist. Not sure if I can go back to my CBT course as I have missed so much time from university due to my current episode. This is my worst episode ever. I have had depression for 8 years, and have been ashamed and embarrassed by it. As my life seems to be ebbing away, I have come out with it and seeking psychiatric help. My problem has been that I work in psychiatry and have feared loosing my job/career. It means everything to me. It's the only thing I have and couldn't bare seeing it go down the toilet. Friends don't understand and know how to discuss the topic with me. My family doesn't know as it would devastate an already broken family. For 8 years I've suffered in silence, cried silent screams, been tormented by my own brain. I hate imagining living a life like this especially when the long term effects I'm reminded of every day (my patients). The only person I had was my ex girlfriend, we split last year. CAUSE? me. Stress got the better of me, my thinking became screwed and I've lost her, for life. She was the only one I could talk to, some one I had known for, 12 odd years. Depression has ruined my life. This episode has been an eye opener. This is the first time planet earth is hearing about my struggle. Something, which may have otherwise been lost. My secrets buried with me. Don't confuse this as a suicide note. It isn't. It's me talking about things in this way for the first time. I'm over the crisis point but nowhere near my usual self and need to sort my medicines out with my doctor as soon as possible. I've had a brave chat with my boss who is going to sort out a psychiatrist in the next 10 days, all being well. I have only taken one OD in 1998 with a serious intent to kill myself. Doctors said I survived as I woke up. For years I've avoided talking about it, never wanted to see a psychiatrist but realize now (well for now) that there is 2 people inside me. One is me, the other is depression and to stand the best chance of staying well and keeping well then I need to face I have a problem. Around 3 weeks ago I was so actively suicidal, I was thinking of jumping off a bridge into the river, i searched the internet for ways to kill myself. I'm out of that acute phase but don't trust myself. I have tried SSRIs but they just don't agree with me so it looks like I'm going back on Mirtazapine. I stopped taking it sometime ago as I put on weight. Since last year I've lost 2 stone through diet and exercise. In the last 3 weeks I've lost 4 lbs as a result of depression. Right now my mind's blank. I've never chatted to anyone on this forum before but I know you guys know what I'm going through. My life has never been the same since 1998. It never will be. My dad died in 2002 since then things have worsened. I have so much to say I could write on but going to leave it for now. You guys are the first to hear my full (well pretty full) story. I have never had the courage to speak like this before.

When I woke up this morning i wasnt very crabby about waking up at 6:30. Today my Web Design teacher (Mr.Briggs) assigned us a project. We have to keep a blog for three days and then email the address to him so he can see how it's going. My Bio teacher has to be the most boring man alive. He wont look at anyone when he is talking and his voice is monotone. He told us today that one of his hobbies is to go to southern California to catch spiders to keep in the class room. He also told us that his job before he was a teacher was to go through a jar of goop takeing out all the fish larva and fish eggs. he seemed pretty proud of it. I think it was pretty pathetic.

"what is going on with my mom? As I've gotten older I identified something which was probably a source of a lot of neuroticism growing up, but I'm not really sure I'm in the right for noticing this. I have no idea what this is, I haven't met many other people that do this. But my Mom will do this thing where, the happier I get, the less comfortable she is around me.

"I’m ready to be okay with being alone... I want to be okay with being alone. Physically and mentally.  Some days I can go home from work and be okay... but most days I can’t. I just get really sad. And I don’t even know why. I cry.. for no reason. I’m just super upset. And just constantly wonder how great it would be to never feel this again. I often wish I could just be gone and not exist anymore. But I don’t want to kill myself... idk how to explain it. :(  I want to be able to be okay without having friends. I have two friends. And lately I feel like they are just both rude to me and just don’t care anymore... (they aren’t friends with each other so they aren’t like ganging up on me.)  I just feel like I’m less important to them. And they are both just so important to me. And I wish more than Anything I could be on my own and not need them.

"So I finally realized something this week... Been stuck in an episode since my birthday (just turned 25, as per my last post). Can't remember the last time I ate a proper meal. Sleep cycle is fucked. Haven't left the house in a week. Funny enough, I had planned on hanging out and doing some reading in a cafe today... only to never leave the house. All this time, I've been thinking how much I yearn to have someone, anyone, physically check in. Or a partner to cuddle with, hug, and hold me tight.... but all that just fades into the empty void.   I used to be Christian, and used to pray. Now that I'm not, I'm realizing how truly alone I am in dealing with all this. My friends all live in the city center. They have jobs and livelihoods. Ultimately, I have to physically do things by myself. No one's gonna save me. It's heartbreaking.

"seeing other people having close, intimate relationships with each other made me so goddamn sad that I had to leave. I was at a party last night with some friends, and the whole time I saw people talking and hanging out like they were best friends and had known each other for years. It made me really sad because even though I have a wide circle of acquaintances, my mental illness and my fear of rejection makes it so hard to actually get close to people. I’ve been in college for a year and a half and I still don’t have any close friends that I text or hang out with. My friends from high school are all off at different colleges living their own lives now, so we aren’t close anymore. I kept thinking about this last night at the party and I got so sad that I left.   I can only really think of one close friend that I have, and even then we don’t really hang out that often.

I would prefer to be passionate about who I vote FOR, as opposed to being passionate about who I'll vote AGAINST.  Unfortuately, the person who stirs emotion in me for this election is Bush, and that is who I will be voting against.  The War in Iraq has a little to do with my opinion, but truth be told, I liked Bush less than I liked Gore, so Gore got my vote.  Gore stirred zero emotion/feeling in my bones, while Bush made my skin crawl.  The little scumbag liar gave me the creeps.  From the day the Republican 'Party' announced him as their candidate, I was not going to vote for him.  That being said, the party that puts a STRONG candidate in the running will get my vote.  As it stands, the parties are putting candidates out who they feel will offend the least.  That's crap.  We don't need products who are easy to advertise.  We need leaders who will do the best for America.  Bush's entire tenure can be shown in a PowerPoint presentation.   That fucker is on vacation more than anything else.

" Should Social Security be run by the government? Is government good at doing that sort of thing? When I attended a student meeting with one of the chair's of the Fed (in NYC) he said that there are two things that the US has to worry about economically in the future. The first is the trade deficit turning over and the second is the retirement of the baby boomers. Now I read your (MWS) post to Joe Crow about SS' funding till 2040 but the best estimates I can find (the only economist I can find who says otherwise is Paul Krugman from the NYTimes, so maybe I'm off base since he's a superb economist) state that under the pay-as-you-go system within a dozen years the retirement benefits mandated by current law will exceed SS payroll taxes. So we're talking about tax increases within our (or at least my) lifetime (Fortune article called it The $44 Trillion Abyss).  Now, as you mentioned earlier, any serious student of human nature has to look at the world realistically. When you put a social safety net (just like free health care) in place, what's gonna happen? It will be overused...that is human nature unless people are given a clever incentive to do otherwise (I leave wiggle room here in case I’m forced to recant later). People are going to plan on using it, not everybody, not all the time, but those guys on the margin of making a decision on savings will tend to take this retirement benefit into account and, god forbid, plan on it. The system is going to HAVE TO handle the stress from the poor and disabled AS WELL AS the free riders. Now, that's not say that SS is altogether bad, socializing some costs is important, but the pay-as-you-go system is totally ridiculous! You get one guy who knows about accounting and one guy who knows about demographics in a room together and they'll tell you something's got to give: either taxes go up or benefits go down or a little of both. Maybe another variant would work better, but the most libertarians I meet get annoyed when their children’s futures are being taxed away before their eyes.

"Gets worse by the day lately Lately... the depression has been getting worse as each new day arrives. It’s getting to the point where I am afraid of my own mind and thoughts. Lately I’ve been hoping that i don’t wake up from my sleep. In the past six months, I’ve lost two people that I loved so much. One was my best friend of 8 years, we dated for a year and broke up but remained friends until about six months ago. He started to ignore me out of no where. Tried my best to talk to him but... he was the cause of why my depression spiraled back so bad that I almost took my own life. Then I met another guy about 5 months earlier... he liked me, I liked him, I fell in love with him. He knew of my ex/best friend and what he did to me. Guy number two said he wouldn’t do what guy number one did to me... and now I feel like he is doing the same exact thing that guy number one did to me... we haven’t talked in two weeks. I know two weeks isn’t that long to not talk, but... seeing as guy number one didn’t talk to me for two weeks... I can’t help that guy number two is doing the same exact thing and ignoring me and somehow I will lose him as friend. Sadly... I fell really hard for guy number two...

And Grandpa just called and said he's got a prescription to be picked up at the pharmacy before 6pm, so I might as well go by myself.  Thinking about this coming school year, too. I'm so anxious to be done, I just want to get Matt's grad school stuff taken care of and move on with our life. I have one theory class to complete a Communications minor, but it's now cancelled for the Fall semester, which means it will be offered during the Winter semester. If I take it then, it will be alongside the theory class I need for my Literature major, and that would make my brain implode (again). So maybe that was just decided for me. As things stand, this fall I'm taking World Novels (Lit), Western Civilization to 1500 (History), Beginning Latin, French 301, and a morning volleyball class for an even 12 credits. I probably could have handled the theory class this fall, or dropped either Western Civ or Latin and volleyball, but we'll see if it's still cancelled by mid-August. I also need to apply for graduation, but my advisor is out of town this summer, so we'll wait until the Fall semester has started.  It's freezing cold in this house.

"Things that I liked about today so far **Maybe the only way to escape depression is gratitude. Cicero, one of the senators of Rome in the early days of the empire is quoted to have said ""Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.""   I liked waking up early and going to the gym on an intense pre workout.  I like stepping outside in the cold to smoke and feel the warmth when I re-enter the building.  I like seeing the trees trying to survive the winter, how splendorous they are. In them I see people going through hard times and the beauty that exists within them.  I liked logging on to Runescape to escape reality for a couple of hours and talking to my friends on there. The fact that we have escapes is an amazing thing.  I liked seeing three girls meet each other outside and say ""Hiiii how are youuuu?"" and compliment each other. Instead of normally being irritated by that, I actually admired that people in reality share bonds and happiness with each other's presence, and it made me happy to see that.  I like the complexity of the mathematics that I'm doing and the fact that I'm doing it.  I like having a planned meeting with a group of people today for my class presentation in college.  I like having a picture of a God who constantly forgives and is deeply saddened by our unhappiness that becomes to hard to bear for some, versus a picture of an angry Colonel with zero mercy.

I have school tommorow btw. This has occured 4 days ago and each day i have gotten more sad. I have been trying to cope for it by trying to find new friends (which i did but they live in other countries so its hard to find playtimes) and also contacting old friends. I have asked my friends each day if they wanted to play and they say idk or maybe. i dont want to kill myself but i dont want it to come to that.

"I probably ruined everything Tonight I ruined almost a year of work. My girlfriend of 12 years and I had a really rough 10 months, and I have been working really hard to build up our relationship. However, tonight my depression and an existential crisis got the best of me, and I made a stupid decision. I tried to steal a bunch of things from Walmart, but I got caught. Her sister is the manager, and was the one who caught me. I told my girlfriend and she didn’t say anything. I’m worried that I’m going to lose her. If I lose her, I’ll have nothing.

"Nothing. I just don't want to do anything. Nothing is the only thing that ever sounds good anymore. The stuff I study in school is really cool, but when I get home I just want to lay down and do nothing. Smoking weed makes it easier but I know I'm just pushing my feelings away.  I'm just... Tired. And I feel like a bitch because of it. I go to school, work on some homework, go to work, procrastinate homework to get some damn relaxation time, rinse, repeat.  I wish I could stop working and just focus on school, cuz it genuinely makes me happy as long as I can dedicate the time to it. But after working I just wanna do nothing. And if I work less hours I just get stressed about paying rent.  I don't know if I hate myself or this economy more, but I just wish I could go far away sometimes. Just leave everyone behind and find somewhere to sit and do nothing. Listen to a waterfall crash in the forest, or just look up at a sky that isn't polluted to hell with light.

"Housemate/friend won’t come out of her bedroom and is pregnant So my boyfriend and I moved in with our friend and her bf. We all had this idea of living together, hanging out, have dinner get togethers with our other friends &amp; board game nights etc.. it was all great and exciting but then at day 1 after the move, our friend and her bf just kept to themselves, in their room and hardly hangs out with us. Issues came up with them not helping out with the household chores and when my bf and I brought it up, they got defensive. Then our friend informed us that she is pregnant which changes the dynamics in the house even more as they now plan to get out of our shared lease early. That leaves us to figure out how to pay for the remaining months and look for a replacement. That’s fine, it’s their decision to have the baby. But then immediately after that announcement  my friend just literally stopped talking to us, she won’t leave her room, and she would have her bf bring food to her room. In a rare occasion that she comes home while we’re in the living room , she doesn’t say hi or talk to us. I am really confused and hurt because I feel like I’ve lost a friend that I used to know. Now, it’s been a few months since I talked to her. She’s there in the other room behind a wall and it hurts that this is how we have to live. I honestly don’t know what to do.

"It's extremely difficult for me to cry. I used to deal with depression through breaking down and crying at night, and it was a really helpful way to out all the negative emotion, and I always felt much better after. For over a year now, it's been extremely difficult for me to cry. Unless I'm pushed to the absolute edge, when I feel like I should be crying it's more just a feeling of emptiness. This means that I feel like I can never release my feelings, and that it feels really greyscale at times, and on the rare occasions I can cry it hardly helps as it's basically a panic attack at that point. I don't really know why I'm posting this, but does anyone else deal with this? I'd love to hear from someone who maybe has advice on how to handle it.

"I am new here. I'm from Australia, I'm 27 years old next month, married with a 2.5 year - old daughter and a baby son on the way. I work in Insolvency (liquidations etc). I have been on antidepressant medication on and off for about 4 years now (initially Aropax, now Aurorix), in hindsight I have actually suffered from depression for my entire life. I'm a similar personality to my mother who also suffers from depression. My younger brother and sister seem to have drawn the long straw as such, they seem not to be affected.  Things went downhill for me about the time I started on medication. I was in the early stages of a major gambling problem, and untreated depression had led to a real strain on my marriage. We split up for 3 months (during which time I made 2 lame suicide attempts), reunited and seemed to get back on track, having our first child. Throughout this time the gambling problem intensified, and spiraled out of control to the point where I am now a bankrupt. During this time I also became extremely withdrawn to the point where I hate leaving our house and am more or less unable to cope with spending time with anyone except my wife and daughter. I also had something of a breakdown about 9 months ago, quit my job, which led to great tension between me and my wife (spending 24 / 7 together), eventually she could not cope and moved out. Shortly after we worked it out and I moved in with her.  Things seem pretty good now, we are a lot more relaxed about things and we just seem to get along better, looking forward very much to the birth of our second, in about 6 weeks time. My gambling problem is pretty much dealt with (thanks chiefly to having little money and no access to it now) but I am still depressed, withdrawn and generally tired of life. To be honest, I am only around because of my wife and daughter, I feel little reason to exist other than for them.  I am also a christian and this is very hard, because there is a real burden of ""I shouldn't feel this way, I should be happy"". This leads to more depression, and at the moment I am reluctant to go to church, I don't pray or read the bible. I'm generally resentful of anyone who I consider to have a better existence than me (which is just about everyone). So while things are quite stable at home, I personally am at my lowest point in some respects. I am quite intelligent and every employer I have ever had has commented on my abundance of potential but lack of drive. So true, I lack any kind of ambition (and harbor something of an extreme opposition to materialism and the pursuit of money and possessions) and even now am tossing up whether to continue working. I have a chief interest (i.e. motorsport), but other interests have been decimated e.g. I used to be quite a good pianist but now have absolutely no desire to play. I also can't get the motivation up to get involved in playing sport, which in the past has been a big part of my life.  So that's me in a nutshell. My extreme difficulty in taking on face to face help / relationships has driven me to get involved in some online depression forums as I think this may be a good way for me to start some kind of recovery.

" I've heard about blogs quite a bit and finally decided to test the waters of putting one together.  I'll be curious to see if this changes my life any.  I'm sitting in my recently-painted TV room watching some show about ancient man-made things found off the island of Malta.  It's typical Science Channel stuff.  I love anything like that.  I'm also sitting in various chat rooms right now, but not really monitoring what is going on in them.  But if someone wants to chat me, that's cool.  I'll chat back -- maybe.  The TV room is now Ruby Red.  Or as a friend of mine called it -- ""Ho Red"".  It was a bitch to paint.  But I did it all myself.  It took one coat of primer and 4 coats of the red.

" Last Sunday I completed my first long run, 5 miles. Not bad. I followed the suggested training regimen this week, even the Friday cross-training session. My packet of training info suggested that “pool running” was, “…hands down the best cross-training activity for runners…”. I decided since I bought a swimsuit last fall, I would put it to good use at Yale's Olympic-sized pool.   The only person in the area who didn't think I was a complete idiot was the undergraduate student lifeguard, whom I informed of my intent to “pool run”. He was a member of the Yale swim team, and, “very familiar with pool running.” He proceeded to describe types of pool running exercises, and while trying to explain one in particular, asked me if I was familiar with water polo. I replied, “No, but I know how to play Marco Polo.” Unfortunately, my childhood days of Marco Polo training proved insufficient…   Referring to pool running, the article states that, “… it looks a little odd.” Well, they were right. All 15 or so people at the pool, including the children trying to play around in the lane next to me, thought I was a complete whack-job. To give you a better idea of what pool running looks like, think of a common dream you might have had or heard of - you know, the one where someone is chasing you and you're running but not going anywhere? It's like that, but add to your mental picture: 8 lanes of professional swimmers, 1 lane of 3 kids trying not to stare, a swim cap, goggles, and Melissa Bourgeois trying to “run” to the other end of the pool without drowning. That's pool running.   Although I looked like a total ass in the pool, I felt great afterwards, much unlike I feel today. It seems I have either mild food poisoning or a stomach virus – either way, I can't even think of food without wanting to vomit. Suffice it to say I will not make my 6 mile long run today, which I am very disappointed about. It's only going to make my 7 miler next week that much harder. I'm trying to get as much rest as possible today so I can try to make up the long run tomorrow. We'll see. Right now I'm going to head for the couch and a little comedy central… ",0,sunday completed long run mile not bad followed suggested training regimen week friday crosstraining session packet training info suggested pool running wa hand best crosstraining activity runner decided bought swimsuit fall good use yale olympicsized pool person area did not think complete idiot undergraduate student lifeguard informed intent pool run member yale swim team and familiar pool running proceeded type pool running exercise trying explain particular asked familiar water polo replied no know play marco polo unfortunately childhood day marco polo training proved insufficient referring pool running article state that look little odd well right people pool including child trying play lane me thought complete whackjob better idea pool running look like think common dream heard know chasing running not going anywhere like that add mental picture lane professional swimmer lane kid trying not stare swim cap goggles melissa bourgeois trying run end pool drowning pool running looked like total as pool felt great afterwards unlike feel today mild food poisoning stomach virus way think food wanting vomit suffice say not make mile long run today disappointed about going make miler week harder trying rest possible today try make long run tomorrow see right going head couch little comedy central
"I've been having a difficult time lately. In addition to my mental state of disarray, I have a medical condition that can affect my mood. My medication has changed lately; my body hasn't caught up the difference yet. The last few days have been particularly bad, especially at night. The familiar sensation lurks again on my upper leg. Scissors. Half-dozen lines -- my usual, though in the past I would sometimes keep cutting until my self-hatred was momentarily spent. Pressure on the blade to force the skin to gape slightly and bleed more. I am not proud. I knew it wasn't the best way to cope. I did at least take the precautions of using a sharp blade, knowing that a jagged blade could leave a jagged wound, and of lavish aftercare. I washed it out with rubbing alcohol, which causes renewed bleeding but was necessary to keep everything clean and infection-free. Covered everything with a jumbo Band-Aid, the kind kids put on skinned knees, and haven't dared to look since. Afterward, I was afraid that I was back to my old ways. I told myself in near-hysterics that this was strictly a one-time backslide. The surprising part is that I believed myself. This does not make me a cutter again. This does not mean that I have lost everything that I've gained. All it means is that I have been having an extraordinarily bad time and resorted to extraordinary behavior in order to cope. My situation will improve. My body chemistry will even out. It's better not to cut, but I am not a bad person even if I do cut. The words are stupidly simple. I don't care. They are my magic that keeps me going.",1,having difficult time lately addition mental state disarray medical condition affect mood medication changed lately body not caught difference yet day particularly bad especially night familiar sensation lurks upper leg scissors halfdozen line usual past cutting selfhatred momentarily spent pressure blade force skin gape slightly bleed more not proud knew not best way cope did precaution using sharp blade knowing jagged blade leave jagged wound lavish aftercare washed rubbing alcohol cause renewed bleeding necessary clean infectionfree covered jumbo bandaid kind kid skinned knee not dared look since afterward afraid old way told nearhysterics strictly onetime backslide surprising believed myself doe not make cutter again doe not mean lost gained mean having extraordinarily bad time resorted extraordinary behavior order cope situation improve body chemistry out better not cut not bad person cut word stupidly simple not care magic keep going

"I'm going to the party Awhile back I was out drinking with my aunt. She decided to tell me a"" huge family secret""  that my father was murdered by the guy my mom dated after he died. And that my mom was complicit.   That my gramma and uncle , both dead now believed this too. That some doctor at the hospital said he looked as if he had been beaten to death.   This pissed me off and confused me greatly since  my mother can't speak up for herself. She died  7 yr's ago.   My aunt wasn't even there when my dad died in front if all us kids and my mom from an aneurysm when I was 2.   This explains a lot about how I always felt me and my mom were outcast by my dad's family over the years.   Yes my mom was a hippy and my dad's family didn't approve of her since she already had 4  kids when they married.   Yes after he died she dated one of their mutual friends, who was black which they also disapproved of.   That night riding my bike home from the bar I was crying and so confused praying to my mom and dad why would she say this to me?   So i called my big sister/ best friend who calmed me down saying no, she was there, he wasn't murdered, my aunt just talking shit.   My aunt  called me next day asking me not to tell my siblings what she said. She said she was afraid  the suspected murderer might come after her?!    Anyway by that time it was too late , but i didn't tell her that. I promised not to tell. I shouldn't have lied but the whole thing was just so bizarre I couldn't keep it to myself.   My brother messaged her on FB that she was wrong, that he was there and saw everything , my dad was not murdered.   The fact she would say that about my mom really upset all of us.   Well since my brother messaged her, my aunt and my cousins completely ghosted me and my kids over the holidays and everything.   Before then we were close travelling together and going to events and parties all the time. My kids don't get it. Where is auntie they say , can we go visit? I just say she's busy.  So yesterday my cousins ex posted about a birthday party for her 3 yo son. I msgs her me and my 4 and 7 yo would like to go. She said sure sorry she forgot to invite us.   So now I'm about to go and see all of them for the first time since all the bs. Im nervous but I know it's the right thing to do.

"Unrequited Love Crept Back Up to Haunt Me First off, I felt the need to create this fake reddit account so that my posts could not be linked to my actual reddit account, and I could vent to reddit without worrying that any of my family or friends will read this.  Unrequited love is the worst. It consumes your mind almost every second of every day.   I'm usually a positive person (at least I try to be). Grew up with this girl in the church. We were the best of friends. In high school, we went to homecoming and senior ball together. I asked her out 3 times, once in middle school, once in freshman year, and once in senior year, all three times given the response ""I'm sorry, I don't like you in that way.""  It messed me up. Even affected my first two relationships. I got with my first girlfriend solely because she liked me. Part of me hoped my best friend would get jealous. I genuinely liked my second girlfriend and she liked me. This girl gave me the butterflies, but because neither of us made a real effort to be boyfriend and girlfriend, we didn't last. Before, after, and sometimes during each of these relationships, I would wish it was my best friend (I know, a dick move).   Then I messed up. I was influenced by a terrible person to say some things I shouldn't have. We went to the same community college like we planned but three years passed without ever seeing each other because we were fighting.  The time that we spent apart allowed me to clear my head. Before, I used to think about her all the time. Now, days, even weeks would pass without her crossing my mind. I met plenty of people in college and made tons of good friends, focused on my hobbies, it was the happiest I've been.   Eventually, we got tired of fighting and I realized what it was that I fucked up: an extremely good friendship. After I made an effort to show how sorry I was, she made an effort to let me back into her life. Then I thought, ""Don't fuck this up. She doesn't need you to like her. She needs you to be a good friend."" I said some harsh things, and because of it, we weren't friends for 2 to 3 years. So naturally, we tried making up for the time we had lost.   She invited me to hang with her friends. I invited her to hang with mine. We would do things together, play music together, video games together, and just genuinely hang out. We talked things over and settled our fight by blaming that terrible person that we both dislike from before.  We eventually went to the same university together and some of her closest friends became great friends of mine. We took a class together. Would exercise together. And we've gotten to the level of ""No judgment"" as she calls it, where I've told her some of my deepest, darkest secrets, and she did the same with me.   Problem is, as we spend each week almost always hanging out 3 or 4 days out of the week. I find it harder to come to terms with us never being together. She's never dated, but she tells me about guys she's liked, little things that happened to her like small romantic contact like ""holding hands"". She has A LOT of guy friends that she's close with, and a few girl friends that she's really close with. And though it only bothered a little back then, it's something I'm jealous of now. Each time I see her, I first think to myself ""be normal, be funny, don't show any signs that you may still have feelings"" and it works.  I'm happy with the way things are, us spending lots of time together, hanging out at each other's houses for hours, trying different foods, and just having someone like her I can talk to.   But thinking about the guy she who will eventually be her first boyfriend, or her husband whom she may have kids with, that future where another guy becomes the guy she sings with, dances with, goes to church with, does romantic stuff with just pains me to think about.   Well, it's late (like 3 in the morning) and this is the time when I'm usually in my feelings. If you've invested time to reading my story this far, I thank you and would like to know what you think about my situation. I'm a bit dramatic, and I overthink like a muthafucka, but I'm an honest fellow, and this is first time venting to reddit. And it's a bit ironic, cuz I should get some sleep since she's coming over tomorrow.   P.S. I thought about solutions like slowly drifting apart from her, but I've come to the realization that I would rather have her in my life as a friend than not at all. But it still hurts.

"Nightmares and dreams HI, I don't know about you, but when I was a kid I used to have this weird nightmares (not the teeth fell out usual nightmares) Like getting lost in a winter forest in pijamas just to be eaten up by wolves, being totally awake at my bed while insects ate me alive ( like sleep paralysis but dreaming?) or just watching my mother being eaten by feral dogs as she protected me.  Anyway, as I grew older and my depression grew with me, I stopped having nightmares, I can barely recall when the last one was. Instead I have pretty vivid dreams (not lucid ones) and in most of them, I'm at some kind of weird scenery where I feel like I've always been there, and weird shit happens that I can remember, and it's like a full story, a lot of different things happen in the same dream. The problem is, in most of them, I meet someone, normally a girl, with which I start a mutual relationship after overcoming some hardship, like, my biggest desire. These dreams, as good as they sound, are worst than the nightmares because when I wake up, it takes some time to realize that I did not live that shit, that I'm still in bed, and I'm still alone.",1,nightmare dream hi not know you kid used weird nightmare not teeth fell usual nightmare like getting lost winter forest pijamas just eaten wolf totally awake bed insect ate alive like sleep paralysis dreaming just watching mother eaten feral dog protected me anyway grew older depression grew me stopped having nightmare barely recall wa instead pretty vivid dream not lucid one them kind weird scenery feel like there weird shit happens remember like story lot different thing happen dream problem is them meet someone normally girl start mutual relationship overcoming hardship like biggest desire dream good sound worst nightmare wake up take time realize did not live shit bed alone

Dealing with a narcissistic mother Ok. I live at home after graduating from college with my mom because I'm in the process of planning my career and finding a job to move out eventually. The thing is its like being in hell when you have a mother with clear mental problems bullying you all the time. She constantly needs attention and if she doesn't get it she changes the locks or threatens me with an eviction notice or tries to remove all the food from the house knowing I don't have anywhere to go and I'm doing all I can as fast as I possibly can to move out. I don't eat much because even if I consume a dollar to 4 dollars worth of food a week she still says I'm eating her out of house and home. I work on my portfolio from sunrise to sunset daily so I'm in my room 90 percent of the time but she accuses me of being secretive because she can't know every little thing I do. She doesn't believe in boundaries and my mental health has suffered greatly because of it. It is now to the point where I've become severely suicidal at times because I feel as if every step I take to start my life away from here she pulls me back 5. What should I do?  I have no where else to live or go.,0,dealing narcissistic mother ok live home graduating college mom process planning career finding job eventually thing like hell mother clear mental problem bullying time constantly need attention doe not change lock threatens eviction notice try remove food house knowing not doing fast possibly out not eat consume dollar dollar worth food week say eating house home work portfolio sunrise sunset daily room percent time accuses secretive know little thing do doe not believe boundary mental health suffered greatly it point severely suicidal time feel step start life away pull do live go
"Am I Depressed? While I've been distraught and suicidal on and off since age fifteen, I've never been formally diagnosed with anything because I don't trust the mental-health establishment. I've only visited a shrink twice: once when forced by parents, a second time when pressured by a partner.  Because of this, I'm reluctant to claim I'm depressed except in the loose, colloquial sense. Instead, I feel my rage and despair flow quite appropriately from my failure to fulfill my desires, achieve my dreams, and so on. I hate being alive and would adore a sudden death, sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm depressed, right?  I don't experience many of the symptoms of formal depression: I sleep pretty well most of the time, I eat okay, and I'm socially active. (I feel abjectly isolated, but empirically I spend a fair amount of time with friendly acquaintances at events and so on.)  I resist the medical model of my mental state because it assumes the problem's with me rather than with the world. I figure I'd be okay if I had the basic level of social success normal folks have: a number of close friends and a healthy romantic/sexual relationship with one or more partners.  I'm becoming increasingly confident my genetics and values combine to make forming meaningful connections with other humans effectively impossible. Because I yearn for such connections intensely, it's only rational that this dynamic would make my life unlivable.  I'm not depressed. My brain ain't malfunctioning; it's as valid a pattern as any. The uncaring universe approves of my mind as much as anyone's. I'm just not biologically equipped to thrive in the environments I find myself in.",1,depressed distraught suicidal age fifteen formally diagnosed not trust mentalhealth establishment visited shrink twice forced parent second time pressured partner this reluctant claim depressed loose colloquial sense instead feel rage despair flow quite appropriately failure fulfill desire achieve dream on hate alive adore sudden death sure doe not necessarily mean depressed right not experience symptom formal depression sleep pretty time eat okay socially active i feel abjectly isolated empirically spend fair time friendly acquaintance event on resist medical model mental state assumes problem world figure okay basic level social success normal folk have number close friend healthy romanticsexual relationship partner increasingly confident genetics value combine make forming meaningful connection human effectively impossible yearn connection intensely rational dynamic make life unlivable not depressed brain ai not malfunctioning valid pattern any uncaring universe approves mind is just not biologically equipped thrive environment in

It's alternate reality I go to escape my loneliness.

For me the last time in my life when I felt like I was truly happy was 2013 and 2014 (mostly the summers) Ever since then life has changed so much. My depression got worse than ever. I spend so much time reminiscing on the good times because life is so crappy now. Does it ever get better again or what?

"Falling back into it I'm 16, and this weekend, I got into a big argument with my girlfriend of 7 months. We hadn't seen each other in 2 weeks, and our plans to see each other fell through. I tried to save our plans, but she seemed disinterested. I was so distraught and caught up in sadness and self-hatred that I, wanting to distance myself from the situation, not just leaving it alone, told her I wanted to break up with her out of sheer emotional irrationality. It turns out I was sadder without her, and she reached out to me to talk soon later. We got back together, and she said she was okay. The way she described the whole situation let me know she understood my plight completely, but I ruined her that day and she's been off ever since. She painted her nails black, screamed at her parents, texted all her friends to tell them how much of a terrible person I was, wrote ""Anon is a piece of shit cunt"" in her bathroom mirror in sharpie, and cried all day from the story she told.  I've fallen into a depression of guilt to a magnitude that I haven't experienced since I was a self-loathing near-friendless 7th grader with pent up emotions drowning it all out with video games while tanking his grades, watching the few distant friends get reward after reward, trophy after trophy.  I feel like I'm a piece of shit that doesn't deserve to breathe the air on this earth, and I don't know what to do. My parents are very unsympathetic and judgmental and my brother is borderline abusive. My girlfriend is the only one left who understands me. At this point, it's just me who has the problem, as she's gotten over the whole debacle, or so she says. Her mom even said ""ehh, you two were just stressed out teenagers"", but I'm still not convinced. I feel like there's something deeply wrong with me.

"Why is it so difficult to preserve wealth within a family for longer than one hundred years? Some family members can make fortune during their lifetime. Because they were lucky, or because they worked hard, or smart. It doesn’t matter. It is almost inevitable that after two generations passing the lucky one the third generation returns to the poverty with very poor financial background. There are always and always will be more failures than successful stories.  Why is it happening?  Because of mismanagement. There are no other reasons! Not because they are too old, too young, too tall, or too stupid… But, because they failed to create a system which can monitor, rule, manage, predict future successes and failures. Most families have no idea that such systems have been existing and successfully helping some families to do this job efficiently.  Do those families share this knowledge with humanity? No way. Why would they do that? They literally rule the world, they have all the power and all the money. I’m fortunate to collaborate with some of those families. What if I ask you: Would it be interesting for you to uncover their secrets and to know how they do it? Would it be interesting for you to see a blueprint of their success?  Many families are struggling in our society.  They have no idea where they are going to and what goals they have.  It leads to frustration, procrastination, apathy and depression.  Because they have been caught in a daily routine. Day after day, month after month… No time to think, no time to plan, no time to review or set goals. In my opinion, this is the reality for 99,99% of the human population of the Earth. Is there a solution?  Yes!  But, you have to implement some strategies.

"today is my birthday :) Today is my birthday. 8th alone. 22 today, a number that i never would've thought i would reach. I bought some of my favorite snacks and got my old blanket, just going to watch some of my favorite movies today. I also bought a card for myself ( which i do every year) , written on it was ""Happy Birthday, Love mum and dad""... they were the last people to ever tell that to me and i know that even tho its been over a decade since they're gone, they were the last people to celebrate and be happy because of me, the last people to love me. i miss them so much. I get so lonely, its hard to cope sometimes, i wish i could spend more time with them. I love you mum and dad :)   EDIT 1: Thank you all so much for the wishes, it really means a lot. this is the most i've gotten in years. Really made my day, been struggling to cope especially in the last few months, everything is just hitting like a train so thank you to all! Wish you all a good day :)   EDIT 2: THANK YOU SO MUCH TO EVERYONE! You are all such awesome people.

"I find the word ""crippling depression"" very true. But I think it's also a vicious cycle. Anyone have ever done this? It's like you stay in bed or sit around because you feel depressed.

" ok so today has been a pretty good day considering.... The other nanny is going to be gone for the whole day and the baby nanny really doesn't help me all that much... none of the kids were in bed before 9:30 (not my fault) and the mom is home. This morning was fine the kids and I were joking around all the way to school so the day started off with laughs and smiles. Then I took the 3 year old to pre-school and we had no problems... I picked him up we had a good lunch and afternoon he fell asleep right away for his nap and the mom is picking the kids up from school..    I found out yesterday that I passed the praxis which is huge for me cuase now I am a certified teacher in the state of Ohio. Whew!! I also got a call on my way to play practice (more about that later) about a job at a school really close to my home town. I am so excited. The principal isn't even asking me to apply just send her a resume and plan on going in for an interview. I had done an experience there and she wants to hire me.. I am almost about to burst!!  I leave for Fl in like 5 days and I am so ready for it!!   so I have been going to this church here and there are these 3 great fun guys my age there. Well the pastors wife, youth pastors wife and the church secretary have all decided that they want me to stick around here.

"the message i wasnt able to send him. Dear ex, today I found out all the truth. I saw you with her. Why have you been lying to me? Why do you tell me you'd love me forever when you don't. Why did you lie to me that you aren't talking to your ex when I know you have been.. when I saw a message that you sent her that said ""When I'm with her I think about you"" that hurt me so much..I still forgave you. Why did you lie to me about her ""suddenly"" coming to see you when you already knew she was coming to see you? Why didn't you tell me you were going to see her when you told me you were out with your friends? Why do I still forgive you even when you keep fucking up? Why do I love you so much that I didn't mind if you don't love me as long as you were by my side? Why did you even tell me you would make it up to me and gain back my trust when you don't prove anything? Why do you keep telling me so much lies? When were you ever sincere to me? Was I a rebound? Are you happier with her now when you used to tell me she never made you happy? Did you get what you wanted now? Is that why you left me? Am I the only one dying here? While you enjoy yourself when we only broke up yesterday? Did I really meant nothing to you? When I thought you could love someone like me because I can't even love myself. I depended on you and you destroyed me. I gave up everything for you. My dreams, my friends, my family, my time, my efforts, blood, sweat and tears for you. Maybe it's just my fault for not being good enough. Maybe I wasn't pretty enough for you? Maybe I was right.. she was irreplaceable after all. I knew it.. no one can love me. I am not mean't to be loved. I am so capable of loving someone so much but that person is always not capable to give the same love. My heart has been torn apart again. When I trusted you so much with my fragile heart. When I prayed to god you weren't like my previous ex. You became like him.. except you were even worse. Why promise me things that you couldn't keep? Why tell me that you love me when you never did.. I just hope that all the memories we had together, at least just one tiny part of it was sincere. Where you actually loved me and was genuinely happy. I'm sorry again that I was good enough to beat her. I hope you and her will stay happy and be together forever.

"I don’t want to continue like this For the past few years, I’ve found it extremely difficult to talk to my mom. Some family drama happened a while back and ever since then she’s been really tense and on edge. Almost every time we have a conversation it turns into a debate, usually ending in me sobbing and her yelling (I’m not trying to paint myself as the victim; I’ve said some nasty things to her as well).  I’m afraid to bring up my anxiety/depression, because whenever I have in the past she rants about how therapy and medication doesn’t work, there are plenty of natural remedies, yada yada yada. I just want to not start panicking every time I’m in public!  She’ll often blow things way out of preportion to what they actually are. If my tone changes during a conversation, or I let out a heavier breath, she thinks I’m “talking back” or scoffing at something she said and start yelling and threatening me. I feel like it might be paranoia, and it’s getting worse.  I basically dread every interaction I have to have with her, but I would really like to have normal mother/daughter conversations, go shopping, have her help me with homework, whatever. Instead of arguing nonstop from morning till night. I just fucking hate it.  Am I being dramatic? If not, what can I do to remedy the situation?

"Hello all. My name is Daniel I'm 23 and going to school in Bowling Green, Ohio. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, ADD, and depression. I've tried various medicines for my ADD and the last one I was on was Effexor XR, usually used to treat depression but can be used for adult ADD, I was on it for a year or two and kept increasing the dosage b/c I wasn't seeing enough results. The medicine dosage got too high and I had a break down during the summer of 05. To vent I would cut myself and eventually attempted suicide in a Kroger parking lot. I went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed medicines, but I've grown tired of using medicines; I had a seizure while on a drug for acne. I refused to take the medicines and have been struggling with killing myself every day. I don't really like going into public due to my social anxiety and tend to turn to computer games to escape reality. I drink more caffeine than is healthy, don't sleep at night, and have fluctuations in eating. I never think I am good at anything, I built a computer last night which kind of made me feel good about myself, but that's not enough. I've stopped going to class because I don't think I'm good enough and haven't told anyone. I'm pretty much a wreck right now and am in the process of going to the counseling center that my school offers. I don't know how much longer I can hold out before I try something else. I am struggling to even be happy around my friends, family and girl friend. They all know I think about it every day, but never say anything. It's probably because I hide my feelings and lie to them about it. I don't want to even keep going to school it feels so pointless. My girl friend wants to get married I don't even want to think about it. I don't want to get married and am too gutless to tell her. I have feelings of breaking up with her but once again I'm to scared and gutless to say anything.

"I'm 19 and I go to school full - time (or try to) and work part - time. I usually end up having a breakdown sometime during the middle of the semester and have to drop either all or most of my classes. In two years I've only completed 27 credits and I feel like a total failure. I struggle through the semester even when the classes are not that difficult. I just have a hard time focusing, concentrating and simply maintaining an interest in my classes. I just feel like an idiot and a failure sometimes because others my age are so much further along than me and I feel if I could just make myself focus more, I would be too. When I am able to concentrate, I do well but it's so rare that I am able to concentrate. On top of all that, I hate my job. It fills me with dread anytime I even think about having to go. I just feel overwhelmed sometimes and I feel like I'm not going to amount to anything in life. I started medications at the end of May but so far they haven't kicked in yet.

"Hi everyone, I am a 39 year old complete mess up. I have suffered from depression most of my life. About 18 years ago my world crashed around my head. I went into blackness like no other. Attempted suicide several time, went through a period of self mutilation, went on every depression drug known to mankind, through years of therapy. This lasted 10 years. I took a massive overdose and was on life support for 5 days. When I finally regained consciousness my doctor told me it was a miracle I was alive. After that I seemed to put my life back on track. I still suffered periods of depression but nothing extreme. Until now that is. Now I feel myself slipping into that hole again and I am terrified.",1,hi everyone year old complete mess up suffered depression life year ago world crashed head went blackness like other attempted suicide time went period self mutilation went depression drug known mankind year therapy lasted year took massive overdose life support day finally regained consciousness doctor told miracle alive life track suffered period depression extreme is feel slipping hole terrified
" Tonight was a momentous night. Apologies to Kelly Holmes, but while she was achieving her dream of olympic gold my mind was elsewhere. At just about the same time my daughter Ellie took three teetering first steps and our house errupted in a state ot total euphoria. In the seconds following the great event Ellie lost her focus and tumbled towards the ground, only to be swept up in a bear hug and given another chance. We weren't disappointed that Ellie only managed three steps, or even that she fell. Her triumphant grin and clapping hands were enough to melt the coldest of hearts. I can't help but wonder if God ever feels the same way about me. Maybe sometimes I focus too much on the end result and not enough on the joy of having a God who is there when I throw myself on Him in an attempt to do something I could never do without Him. I think next time something doesn't go my way I might try to take a leaf out of Ellie's book. Perhaps I'll clap my hands, grin triumphantly and try again, realising that a little progress can be a pretty big deal. And to Kelly Holmes mother..... I think I know how you feel!!!

"Best friend of 12 years seems to be drifting When we were in middle/high school we were inseparable. I thought she was the most amazing person to ever walk the planet. She made me feel so smart, beautiful, special, etc...I loved her so much. We went through everything together during those times and when college came around, we went to different schools. I had to work 2 jobs to keep my head above water and couldn't always make the 4-hour drive to see her as often as I wanted. She also got into drugs, which was no issue with me, but since I was never into it, I stopped getting invites to places with her (probably due to the fact I always was ALWAYS working.) We both drifted a bit in college, but then afterward we (and our SO's) moved to the same city. I was so excited to finally have a better schedule and see her as often as I could. I told her how I found God after struggling with depression and anxiety and she immediately accused me of being homophobic because I said I was Christian (born again I guess, we both grew up Catholic). Which was severely not the case. She also accused me of being so different that it's like she doesn't even know who I am anymore. I let her vent about the drifting and the differences we both grew into since middle/ high school, without even mentioning to her that she was different too, it's called growing and changing as you age, but I still loved her just the same...then I expressed how I don't want to lose her over this and we eventually squashed the beef. I know she doesn't like my boyfriend of 5 years all that much, mainly because she thinks he changed me, not taking into account that I can make my own decisions and have my own thoughts that that nothing to do with my boyfriend's. 2 years go by and during those two years, her father passes away unexpectedly. He was the light in her life and it was so painful to see everything she went through during that time. I was there for her as often as she needed me and then some. Eventually, things started to feel really one-sided. I kept ignoring it because I knew she was grieving, but after almost 2 years, it was starting to get to me. My calls and texts were hardly received, she always seemed to be in a rush to talk to me, it felt like walking on eggshells. I guess now, what really bothers me is that a friend of hers is going through a hard time with her SO and my best friend has been extremely supportive and just going above and beyond with this other girl, while all I feel like I've received from her is criticism of my relationship, my values, my political views (which she really knows almost nothing about but assumes my position). As I write this, I'm actually getting angry at how much I've been there for her, but how little she has been there for me. I'm extremely scared to bring all this up to her because she is so critical and everything she says cuts deep. It's not a good feeling, but neither is this. I don't really know what to do, and I can't imagine losing her. I would hope I can work up the confidence to tell her how I'm feeling and we can have a rational conversation about it.

" It is weekends like this, that make Seattle a great place to be.  Spending alot of time out on my back deck (temps in the 80's).  Spent yesterday afternoon organizing the neighborhood water gun fight.  It seems that over the last few summers I have aquired a small arsenal of super soakers, and squirt guns, so am able to arm most all of the neighborhood kids.  Really have to get a digital camera in the budget so I can post pic's.  It was not all play yesterday, as I was doing some side work (home networking).  This is the part of the post that could actually be useful for someone reading it.  Although most everyone I know that would read this is a techie.  Here it is, the three simple things to do, to keep your computer and/or computers and home network running smooth.  1.  KEEP those Anti-virus definitions updated and current.  You can actually schedule it to do it without any user intervention.  We would also like to ask all virus writers to please not spoof the email address of the dumbass who opened the virus in the first place.  We would really like to know who this person is.  2.  Run those Microsoft Critical updates, or get a MAC.  3.  Spyware is slowing down alot of the computers that I work on.  Download and run Adaware, its free.  I personnally recommend SpySweeper it tends to be a little more proactive.  There it is my feeble attempt to help people and computer relations.

"Just ranting. It fucking annoys me when I tell someone I’m depressed and they say “why.” Like, when someone tells you they have the fucking flu do you ask why? How are people so dumb about mental illness?  I have people who say “yeah, I was depressed before,” and I’m like “what did you do” and they say it just went away. Seriously? You just woke up and it was fucking gone? Poof?   Everyone always has their golden fix for me too. My mom tells me to drink lemon water. My dad says “stop worrying so much.” My coworker says “meditate.” Exercise. Volunteer. Quit your job and go do what you love (which is what, exactly?).   I try so, so, so hard to not be depressed. But if I’m not pushing myself 120% to stop it, it comes back, and I’m back to square one. And I can’t, I just can’t keep doing it. It’s just like pushing a rock up a mountain with no peak.   My favorite are the people who say “you need to let go. Just let go of the past.” These are the people that post dumbass quotes on Facebook and Instagram who haven’t experienced a day of depression in their lives. Let go of WHAT? What does that even fucking mean? I ask these people to go into detail, and they don’t. They act like a fucking monk, and just say, “You just have to let go.”   All of those people can go fuck themselves.",1,just ranting fucking annoys tell depressed say why like tell fucking flu ask why people dumb mental illness people say yeah depressed before like did say just went away seriously just woke fucking gone poof golden fix too mom tell drink lemon water dad say stop worrying much coworker say meditate exercise volunteer quit job love which what exactly try so so hard not depressed not pushing stop it come back square one cannot just doing it just like pushing rock mountain peak favorite people say need let go just let past people post dumbass quote facebook instagram not experienced day depression life let what doe fucking mean ask people detail not act like fucking monk just say just let go people fuck themselves

" Some days I feel so bloody old. It's the way I remenisce over old times and experiences I had when I was younger. And I think it's the fact that I do this so oftern is what makes me feel like a bit of a dinosaur. Maybe I'm being overly aware of the changes that have occurred over the last few years. I'm 26 and that's really nothing in the scheme of things. But I had such a crazy time from 16-22, 23 that I can't help but sometimes feel in awe of the times I've had.  I imagine alot of us go through it but I seem to be the only who keeps talking about it.  I think I'm a narcissist. I think I think about what I think about way too much. Am I overly concerned with the way I perceive myself? Why do I always have to feel ""good"" about every situation. Even when I'm with a person, when we part I always feel the need to make the parting ""smooth and clean"".  No awkward goodbyes and whatnot. But then I think that because I'm already anticipating the situation that makes it awkward. Anybody else ever feel like that?  Why do I always have to find the things that I think are wrong with me and then make a strategy of how I""m going to combat and resolve those inequities? How good it would feel to say: I'm selfish, I smoke too much pot, I'm cheap, I always need things to be 'even'  AND THAT'S HOW I AM. DONE. No plan, no outline to correct my traits gone awry. I bet people live like that. It must be fucking great! And very freeing....  We took grandma out for lunch today to celebrate her 78th birthday. I wrote on her card: P.S. You don't look a day over 50!!  I thought it was rather clever and tongue in cheek for a variety of reasons. In fact I thought it funner to say 50 as opposed to 20 seeing as 20 is such a stretch it's not conceivable. Either way i don't think grandma got it. ""oh, we better not let anyone see this"" was her response. Shit, then I felt like an asshole and even when were at lunch I kept thinking about how uncool it was, and I couldn't shake the feeling that everything wasn't perfect and smooth. Aya.

"I am starting to feel really frustrated with life because there are things I don't understand about the world. My problem is I think too much and I wish I was off in space thinking about a night out in the city but I'm not. Instead I focus on every negative thing I can. I would never kill myself and because I wouldn't do that I really want to know how I can get over all this shit and be happy with what I got. I don't know if it's my mind playing the victim but I feel like everyone close to me is out to hurt me. For example I am 20 and I don't have a car. I can understand I should already have it like two years ago but this a prime point for my parents to pick on me. For some reason my mom got herself into a bit of a mood and started having a go at me which caused me to end up in tears because she told me I am hopeless and so are all my brothers and that I am an embarrassment. This is all because I don't have a car! She's usually really caring but she came out with all this stuff. Am I going crazy or is it really a huge deal to not yet have a car? Is it worth hurting your daughter over?? Then there is my supposed ""boyfriend"" who picks on me about my weight. I am not as thin as I once was. I've put on about 10 kilos in 3 years. I know it's not a good thing but for ages everything was about my weight. I used to weigh 54 kg which is tiny and now I am 64kg. My boyfriend is at university and thinks that my life holds no meaning because I apparently have no hobbies and I just turn up to my ""little job"".  I have friends that are completely selfish and I always end up paying for everything and they can't even do me a simple favor. I don't want to play the victim because I've been a punching bag for so many people who themselves have played the victim so it's nothing I would aspire to be.     I could write pages and pages and pages of how annoyed I am but I thought I'd just give an idea. I'm sick of people being the way they are to me and making me out to be a energy drain. Does anyone know what to do to not feel bad about who you are?

"I don't know how to go about this. Hey. Im Tomm.  Ive had a fucking miserable time in the last 21 years. I havent been happy for the last 11 years and when i finally am happy and get into the swing of it, it fucks off and leaves me to suffer. Rant; for the last 10 years my dad has had cancer, hes not well at all. It seems im the only one who gives enough of a shit to help him. I wouldve moved away and had a life by now, but ive stayed purely for him. Last week i realised hes manipulating me to get anything he fucking wants. The girl ive been chasing for 6 months that i fell in love with has just fucked me off. Long story short about 3 months ago she had a 2 year anniversary with a guy but admitted she has a thing for me. So i waited it out and about 3 weeks ago they broke up so i thought 'hey, ill see if i can hang out with her and see what happens' nope. Told her i still feel how i did and she just says 'i see you as a friend and nothing more'. Maybe im just not cut out to be here, or to deal with people?

"Would you still be friends? Are we unreasonable? Hello dear people of Reddit  I have a small major problem in my little group of friends. My problem is rather selfish but I feel betrayed and I don't know if she is still our friend. So let's start all over. There are 5 people involved BF (My Boyfriend) Snorly (My female friend and the 'victim') Berta (My other female friend that gave me the feel of beeing betrayed) Root (Because of him kinda started everything) And my humble self.  So it all begun wenn Root sexually assaulted Snorly, she was at his home, learning with him and afterwards they watched something together, she started to feel tired and was half asleep. He touched her during that period she was shocked and pretended to wake up, when he noticed he pretended to be also asleep. She told him at the beginning, we all go together to school, that she had a Boyfriend and that she doesn't want any romantic relationshio with him.  He didn't stop. At a slumber party we all were together, he touched her again, and suddendly lied directly next to her.  She still hadn't told us any of this.  Then came the point where he told someone some really private storys of us, which we told him in secret. We ignored him for a while but gave him a 2 chance.  He messed up, again. My friends had to go to a further education, I wasn't with them because I work in another company, but well there he was awfull to BF when someone asked him why their team was so slow he answered because of 'BF'.  This was the limit. We wanted to have nothing to do with him anymore.  Snorly told us sometimes earlier what he had done to her. He told her to not tell anyone. But she told us that anyway and his boss.  Now he gives her the fault, that everyone hates him.  Just to mention, Root has depressions, and has already attempted suicide. So there are also moral and ethical views on everything. We don't bully him or anything like that, we ignore him.  Well, Berta still hangs out with him, she even ditches us to eat lunch with him. And no she doesn't have any romantic intrest in him but in one of his best friends.  We expected her to side with us. It is selfish but I can not forgive Root for what he has done, when doesn't even apologized for his actions or stands justice.  Berta doesn't care. She laughs with him, she hangs out with him af if he has never hurt us. And this, this feels like betrayl.  How do you see it guys? Are we wrong? Are we to harsh? Would you want to be still befriended with a person who sides with another person who hurt you? Or are we unreasonable?  Tl:Dr My friend sexually assaulted another friend multiple times and was a mayor dick to us but our other friend still hangs out with him, would you still be friends with that person?

"Thoughest time of my life, and honestly i cant show it So i meet this girl for nearly 2 years ago.  I'd say we are probably more then best friends, we are soul friends.  For over a year we talked about me moving to their town, so i can get closer to her, her husband and her kids.  We have literally been talking for nearly  2 years straight.  I understand that she is getting abit tired of me now,  but i just moved 1 week ago  and she has bearly talked to me once.  She is so busy playing video games right now, the only one that really has helped me this past week is  her husband.  I feel i moved so far for nothing, and now its KILLING me.  and since i wont have internet for a while,  im getting bored out of my mind, and my depression is hitting me so hard..  I did confront her about this though, but she keeps saying she is depressed and the only way for her is to play games.  Even tho when i play games, she keeps going to private worlds with friends, and whenever i as for an invite, she ignores it, even tho it pops up a big icon on her face.  My life has been so hard lately, my mom lost her kids in court, other then that, my stepdad made an false accusation of me doing stuff to a child becasuse he is a fucking moron and wanted to ruin my life for fun. (And no, i didnt do anything to a kid just FYI). I won the case but it was ever lasting 3 years..  Other thatn that ive been bullied for 15 years, i've lived alone for since i was 16.   Aswell im a very VERY jelous guy, so im not gonna deny that, and here is one of the issues with this:  MY EX fucked my life up with cheating on me, and since then i have big trust issues, aswell i tend to get very jelous now when my best friend is getting new friends and seems to have more fun with them then me.  Tho, i know my best friend would never leave me since she wanted me up here anyway, but the jelousy that she is having such a good time with others are ripping my life apart.  The past 5 Months has been depression only, and Honestly if people has gone through as much as me these past 5 months with suicidal thought every day, they would of gone mental.  I have a very strong mind, so it takes alot to take me down mentally, but for some reason, im lost and i dont know what to do. Half of the time i just wanna sit and cry.  Before i was friend with her, i had a depression but it wasnt that bad. I didnt have friends then so i didnt have to go through what i have now,  For some reason i feel like im not designed to have friends, that my life should keep going on the PC without real ""friends""",1,thoughest time life honestly meet girl nearly year ago say probably best friend soul friend year talked moving town closer her husband kid literally talking nearly year straight understand getting abit tired now just moved week ago bearly talked once busy playing video game right now really helped past week husband feel moved far nothing killing me wont internet while im getting bored mind depression hitting hard did confront though keep saying depressed way play game tho play game keep going private world friend invite ignores it tho pop big icon face life hard lately mom lost kid court that stepdad false accusation doing stuff child becasuse fucking moron wanted ruin life fun and no didnt kid just fyi won case lasting year thatn ive bullied year lived aswell im jelous guy im not gonna deny that issue this ex fucked life cheating me big trust issue aswell tend jelous best friend getting new friend fun me tho know best friend leave wanted anyway jelousy having good time ripping life apart past month depression only honestly people gone past month suicidal thought day gone mental strong mind take alot mentally reason im lost dont know do half time just wanna sit cry friend her depression wasnt bad didnt friend didnt now reason feel like im not designed friend life going pc real friend
"I'm a 24 year old female and I am extremely ugly.  Despite having tried a slew of products recommended by dermatologists, and washing religiously, I nonetheless I have the most disgusting skin ever (EVER.  You know Freddy Kreuger?  He suddenly starts to look quite appealing next to me).  And I have ... unfortunate features.  I have a nose that would shame Pinocchio, small eyes, and a manly jaw.  This never used to bother me too much, because I've lived with being Unfortunate Looking my whole life, heard all the insults in school, and I figured that anyone who didn't want to know me because of my appearance wasn't worth my time.  I try to make the best of what I've got - I'm not especially clever or talented in anything, but at least I dress nicely, get my hair done, wear makeup and all that, and I try to enjoy myself.  I knew I was unattractive, but I hoped that people enjoyed my company, and that one day I might even charm someone with my lovely personality enough that he might want to date me despite my appearance (it hasn't happened yet, but you've got to tell yourself SOMETHING, right?).  I have lots of friends, and even though I'm forever boyfriend -less, I'm the one that people seem to depend on for everything but sex, and that has always been a comfort to me.  But yesterday, I overheard a friend - a friend! - saying that my skin is ""disgusting"" and I ought to ""do something"" about it.  He said that it was no wonder I was single.  He said it was a ""shame I wanted children so much, since no one would ever want to get close enough to impregnate me"".  The person he was talking to suggested IVF.   I don't think I will ever be happy again.  I want to cut my face off.  I want to cut my face off and stick a grenade in my mouth. I don't want anyone to ever, ever look at me again.   I can't believe how utterly worthless I feel.  It's not just that they think I'm ugly - that's hurtful, but I knew I was hardly God's Gift to Men.  But that they would speak about me like that behind my back ... use THAT word in connection with ME?! ... I can't believe how much I've been kidding myself!!  The message is loud and clear: if you're ugly, you're not worth respect or friendship or love.

"I want to tell her, but... Im the kind of girl who doesnt keep secrets from my mom. Recently Ive been keeping a little more.   First of all, I’m in seventh grade. Just saying.   The first secret I’m keeping is Snapchat. I’m not really supposed to have it but all my friends did so I made an account maybe last month and I use it regularly.   I don’t see the need to tell my mom about this :/  But what I want to tell her but am afraid to is that I am dating someone. Last year I dated a boy and she wasn’t mad, she just wanted to know everything. I mean everything. She’d go through all my messages with him, she’d stalk him on Instagram (from my account!), she’d see if he texted me and sit next to me on the bed and watch me text him and tell me what I can and can’t say.   I’m not an inappropriate girl. I get straight A’s, I shame on premarital sex and all that. It’s not like I’m a underage whore (trust me, we have those) and I won’t send nudes!  I really like this guy and he likes me back. He told his mom we were dating literally the day he asked me out. My best friend and her crush (who likes her back) already told their moms about each other.   My mom won’t let me date anymore because it’s a “distraction” and I don’t need to be “messing with hormonal boys” WHICH I’M NOT !   (Also I text this guy on SnapChat, that’s another reason I can’t tell her I have it because then she would demand my password for it and then look through all my messages on there.)  I just wish it would be as easy for me as it is easy for them to tell my mom. Its making me feel super guilty because just yesterday she told me “I love you. You’re such a good daughter.” Which she’s NEVER told me before and she hugged me which she never does unless she wants something.   I’m literally just trying to have some fun in middle school like everyone else.   :(  Please help.

"What kind of things do you want people to tell you? Whenever I reach out to someone about my depression, it seems like they never tell me the things that I want to hear. I usually want someone to protect me, to hug me and tell me they’ll help me every step of the way. I’ve never gotten that though. What do you guys want to hear?

" Okay.. a little about me. I'm married, with 3 lovely kids and an adorable husband. I have just taken a leave of absence from my job at The Home Depot. HD is a pretty good company, but all of the jobs are very demanding and most of my coworkers feel VERY overworked and consumed by their jobs. Before I worked at the store in my town, I worked at the Store Support Center (aka headquarters) in Atlanta, Georgia. I was involved in arranging travel for associates with the company, and also for assisting with employee/family relocations due to promotions/tranfers, etc. I really enjoyed my job in ATL, and miss my coworkers. Working at a store is a completely different world. I'm glad that HD hires people from all walks of life, different ages, colors, etc. But there is such a HUGE variety of experience in our store - it is very strange. We have 18 year old cashiers that came fresh out of the Kwiky Mart that wear their hip hugging bluejeans with the g-string underwear showing at the top and their boyfriends waiting on them out in the parking lot. We've got 55 year old experienced professionals that could build a house from the ground up with a crew of 3. We've got weekend warriors, firemen, schoolteachers, students, homemakers, who just want a part time job for a few extra bucks, and high school students working on the lot, pushing carts, and dreaming of making their way in to management one day.

"Ok I have a couple of questions...I guess. 1st is I finally managed to make myself an appointment with a psychiatrist (it's not till May). Now I'm having second thoughts about it. I just pretty much want to go in for an evaluation (to see if there is a problem) and see if maybe there is a short term solution for the suicidal thoughts I've been having. I've got a summer job I'm leaving for in June and than I'm moving to another city after that. (So basically something till I'm stable with where I'm living and job). I assume I'm only going to be able to see 1 doctor, 1 time before than. So 2nd thoughts have been should I just wait to see someone when I actually get settled. Also if a psychiatrist is who I want to see (I've never been to anyone before for my mental health)...that's what the intake coordinator suggested. Also I was wondering if they could hospitalize you for suicidal thoughts without your permission? Ok now on to the suicidal thoughts questions (and just so people know I do not feel myself to be in any immediate or near immediate danger to myself). One main thing is does depression have to be present for suicidal thoughts/actions? I often find my mind turns more to thoughts of suicide and death when I feel relatively normal mood wise. And that when I have feel really depressed the thought of suicide rarely crosses my mind (but the pain is more severe). I guess that's really all I have. Sorry if the topic is inappropriate for this forum. I just wanted to ask...and maybe discuss with someone...but don't really feel that it's a problem for me right now. If someone wants to talk in PMs I wouldn't mind either.",1,ok couple questionsi guess st finally managed make appointment psychiatrist it not till may having second thought it just pretty want evaluation to problem maybe short term solution suicidal thought having got summer job leaving june moving city that so basically till stable living job assume going able doctor time than nd thought just wait actually settled psychiatrist want i mental healththat intake coordinator suggested wondering hospitalize suicidal thought permission ok suicidal thought question and just people know not feel immediate near immediate danger myself main thing doe depression present suicidal thoughtsactions mind turn thought suicide death feel relatively normal mood wise feel really depressed thought suicide rarely cross mind but pain severe guess really have sorry topic inappropriate forum just wanted askand maybe discus someonebut not really feel problem right now want talk pm not mind either
"I've had a rough time of things lately, which is partly what made me search for this site. I've had recurrent unipolar depression since my mid teens with an associated anxiety disorder and a panic disorder that took root 5 years ago after I beat a drink problem I had at the time (between the age of 22 and 25 I used alcohol as a bit of a crutch which was a huge mistake). Anyway these days I am teetotal, on anti depressants and only really get a bad time with my depression A during the winter months or B if something triggers an episode (circumstantial). Usually it lifts up in the summer months (I think I might get a bit of SAD) but last year my mother passed away on the 23rd of March and it caused a huge crash in my mood which never lifted in time before the winter episode took hold. I dealt with it by comfort eating (I do comfort eat at times, but I also get bad food cravings in the winter for foods such as chocolate, cheese and carbohydrates, so pizza and chocolate ice-cream became my regular fodder for a while). Anyway that lead to weight gain which is besides the point but which I was planning on correcting (as I have done before) this summer when the food cravings wear off and my mood lifted. Unfortunately it's not lifted as of yet due to recent circumstances. Not only did I have the first anniversary of my mother's death to deal with, but my partner whom I loved very much decided that this would be the best time to dump me and completely rip me to shreds in the process. He basically emailed (he lives in another city) a few days before the anniversary of her death saying he wanted to end it. I tried to contact him but he wouldn't talk on the telephone or by voice, and would not respond to any emails I sent him. He then contacted me by IM on the day of her anniversary (23rd March) to rip me to shreds and tell me that he couldn't love someone like me before posting publicly on his journal running me down before posting disturbing replies to some of the posts on my journal anonymously (but I recognized his ISP number so I know it was him even though he denied it) making it sound as though the whole thing was deliberate. I wouldn't mind but it came out of the blue, the night before all this started he was discussing a work transfer to move to where I am and signed off with 'I love you'. Next day, wham. I'm social phobic so don't really have many friends I cant talk to about this, my mother was usually the one id turn to but she isn't here anymore, so my mood, although it usually lifts at this time of year, has taken a nose dive and I'm having trouble getting myself motivated again. The emotional pain I felt on that Thursday was like nothing I had felt for years, I just literally felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest. I couldn't sleep and I couldn't eat for the best part of that week, although I'm eating and sleeping again now. Am I over reacting to what he did, because I'm hurt as hell and completely and utterly infuriated with him at the same time? I know I can be slightly prone to being a bit of a drama queen at times (over reacting to stuff) and I can sometimes be a little paranoid. But the whole thing felt deliberate as though he intentionally intended to hurt me, and even now when I try to contact him to get answers he is being spiteful and running me down. Of course after this I spat a whole load of vitriol at him and now I'm being painted as the one that was in the wrong, and he is saying he did nothing that warranted the vitriol and is the innocent party in all of this. Of course he also interprets home truths as vitriol, and I tend to be very open and say things as I see them, to the point of lacking tact now and again. But whilst I'm willing to stand up and say I made a few mistakes and apologize, he is acting as though the blame is all mine and he did nothing wrong. I just can't seem to make him understand that the way he went about ending the relationship was one of the most hurtful ways anyone could have done it. I know he claims to suffer from bipolar disorder which he wont get treatment for, and I know that can make him highly moody, but I cant understand why he doesn't understand the hurt he caused me, or if he does, how someone who professed to love me, doesn't even seem to care. He seems totally and utterly cold, so cold it's chilling. I know he gets periods of emotional flatness because he told me, and he also told me he hears voices as well. Could he be suffering from some kind of depression related psychosis? One post he made to my journal was: Wisdom comes only to those who seek it, and sometimes to those who deserve it regardless of perfection, intent or even understanding. The common denominator though, seems to be deed. For one must do, or be done to, in order for wisdom to take root. Am I misreading that? Or reading into it? So am I over reacting? Was I wrong to argue back with him?

" I have started a Mel Brooks guild on gaia. So far it only has three members(including me) but what should I expect? Overall, so far so good.  The only prior experiance I've had with guilds(or any sort of online roleplay thing) is Neopets.  I remember starting out at Neopets....it was one of the last days of school during 6th grade...my friend Heather introduced it to me. I became instantly hooked to it(and so did anyone else I convinced to join, lol)  I wasted more than three years of my life there....and I've had at least six seperate accounts, on two diffrent e-mail adresses.(if you want one, PM me on gaia and we'll work out some sort of deal, I'm on a quest and I don't feel like giving anything away for free, lol)  Over time, things got a bit tedious and dull. For those of you reading this and are on Neopets, you know what I mean. You have to play their stupid flash games in order to gain neopoints(their currency) and I just don't have the patience for that anymore. Inflation, one of the negitive aspects of most economies, had gotten extremely high, so items became difficult to afford. So eventually, I just gave up. That, and I outgrew their whole 'kiddie' image.  Now about the guilds....I had created at least 10 or more guilds on that site, and the members almost always consisted of the friends in my seventh grade classes. Boy, I was glad they were around.

"I posted here sometime in December I think. I was having tons of digestive problems, well it's been about 4 months now and I'm still having them, but now I also feel extremely fatigued all the time too, I've had test after test and seen doctor after doctor, everything comes back negative. I was actually put on Zoloft for about a month but taken off of it to try other things b/c that wasn't doing the trick either. I'm back to thinking that it's all in my head, I'm now on b12 shots but those aren't doing anything either. I feel like a zombie, I have zero energy and zero motivation to do anything. Even the simplest task like styling my hair seems like a huge chore that I just want to put off. All I want to do is sleep all day. One thing I've noticed is that man do I ever waste time, I mean I literally do nothing but waste time most of the day. I only have about two hours of class per day and no job so I have tons of free time to waste away. I analyzed what I did in the past hour and it basically went like this: The entire time I was talking to myself non-stop, analyzing things, analyzing my situation, thinking of motivational quotes etc.... I tend to do that all day. For about 15 minutes I stood around leaning against a wall, the next 15 minutes i leaned against the television, then I went and lied down for a while all while still thinking and analyzing things in my head, then I came on the computer to just look at random, pointless things. And that is pretty much how most of my time is spent, I might spend an hour or so just standing around or sitting doing nothing but thinking or daydreaming, that can't possibly be healthy and I obviously have way too much free time, I'm just not sure if this is what is in turn causing all my fatigue and sickness. Have I become so addicted to this lifestyle that my mind will purposely make me feel sick so I have an excuse to live like this?",1,posted december think having ton digestive problem month having them feel extremely fatigued time too test test seen doctor doctor come negative actually zoloft month taken try thing bc not doing trick either thinking head b shot not doing either feel like zombie zero energy zero motivation anything simplest task like styling hair like huge chore just want off want sleep day thing noticed man waste time mean literally waste time day hour class day job ton free time waste away analyzed did past hour basically went like this entire time talking nonstop analyzing thing analyzing situation thinking motivational quote etc tend day minute stood leaning wall minute leaned television went lied thinking analyzing thing head came computer just look random pointless thing pretty time spent spend hour just standing sitting doing thinking daydreaming possibly healthy obviously way free time just not sure turn causing fatigue sickness addicted lifestyle mind purposely make feel sick excuse live like this

"She stopped texting back Hi, i'm 19 and for as long as I remember I have always struggled with self-confidence and my depression. I rarely use tinder because I don't match with many people, I'm below average looking like but it doesn't help swiping for ages and rarely getting a match.   I know it's just a glorified hook up app for the most part but the other night I matched with a really cute girl who was way out of my league and we started talking, one thing leads to another and next thing I know we're up to after 2am talking about Pokémon of all things. I feel like there's a connection there so i ask her out and she says yes. It took alot to do this and it honestly made my month as the last few have been pretty meh.   We kept talking the next day and that evening she didn't reply to one my texts, I tried to think nothing of it because it wasn't really a question or anything and tried to restart the conversation but nothing again.   This morning I said Hi and she replied Hey back and then I asked her what she was up to and she just didn't reply again. I don't blame her if she isn't interested, that's fair enough it happens. She was sending x's up until she stopped texting back though and its not something i thought i was being naive about thinking she was interested in me but maybe i was wrong.   I kinda just wish i knew where i went wrong. I just feel so unattractive and like there's something wrong with me.

"Advice for making it through school In my second year of college my mental health went down drastically and I lost all of my motivation and basically most of my ability to function. I couldn’t do any schoolwork without panicking and crying because I didn’t think I could do it. I was scared of everything. During finals, my cat died and I just sorta gave up. I failed everything and took a year off. My family was so disappointed and treated me so differently for the year that I was out. About a month and a half before the fall semester of 2017, I got on a new medication and decided to felt good enough to go back to school. I knew I had no other option anyway. I did surprisingly well that semester but now that break is over, I’m finding myself just as terrified as I was that semester I failed. I don’t know what happened and I don’t know how to get back to functioning again. I can’t drop out again. Why do I feel so low after having such a strong start?

"Ready to just say ""fuck it"" I can't take it anymore. I'm an atheist democrat living in a family of hardcore christian conservatives. Ive made it clear that Im a democrat, to which they just call me a snowflake all the time, which just makes me resent them even more. I dont dare tell them Im am atheist, but Im thinking about it. I dont have anything to live for anymore.   I dont have any idea what to do with my life. I dont have any special talent or skills. The only hobby I really have is video games, but Im horrible at those. I've raged so hard at Battlefield that I broke down in tears and drooled everywhere, and anytime I play an RPG I restart so many times that it makes me not want to play anymore.   All my friends have at least an idea of what they want to do, but I dont even have the beginnings of a clue as to what I want to do with the rest of my life. And to be honest, Im scared of becoming an adult. Managing a budget, doing taxes, paying bills, and shit like that. Im not fucking prepared for it. If I cant deal with the stress of a fucking video game, then I sure as hell cant deal with a job.   My parents are also hounding me to get a girlfriend. I dont even have a friend who is a girl. All my close friends are male. Hell, the closest Ive came to having a full conversation with a girl is helping her with spanish homework. I aint gay, I just cant talk to girls. The social anxiety makes me want to vomit if I even think about approaching a girl.   So Im ready to fuck it all and just tell my parents Im an atheist.

"What's the deal with my husband's future best friends wife? Hi everyone, I am having a problem and I'm not sure what to do about it. I am led to believe that my future husband's (married next month) best friend's wife dislikes me, but I'm getting mixed signals. I have always (I thought) been nice to her.   When we hang out as couples, everything is fine and we get along great. We have a similar education level and both come from a science background, so it's easy for us to talk. We have spent hours hanging out in these situations. We even all took a road trip together this past summer a few states away to attend a very lovely (albeit very strange) wedding of another of their mutual friends, and we went out to dinner and shopping while the boys were at the bachelor party.   It seems like whenever I try to plan anything though, she isn't available, even if her husband is. I planned a surprise party for my fiances 30th birthday that I had been talking about for months--her husband was there, and at the last minute, she couldn't attend. He didn't even tell me she wasn't coming until he showed up without her. We visited their home on 4th of July weekend and there invited them to my parents house (they have a pool) for the holiday. He showed up, she didn't because she was ""sick"" (read: hungover.) Her husband showed up for an hour or so and she was continually calling him asking when he was going to come home and take care of her.   The thing that makes me think this isnt a string of coincidences is my bridal shower. It is tomorrow, and I have found out she will not be attending. She Rsvpd to my mom with just a generic ""I can't make it, we're busy"" but then a few days later, her husband messaged my fiance asking if he wanted to hang out on the day of my shower.  I have always been nice to her, and I'm not sure whats going on. Anyone in Reddit land have any advice? Her husband and my future husband have been best friends since high school and this is bugging both of us.

"What to do with my life. I just turned 21 in June and I’m really understanding that life is moving at a very fast pace. I was never good in school only because I hated it and never realized how bad it would effect my future the way it is now. I moved away for college at 19 for a whole year and only passed a few classes because I didn’t care that much. I came home and decided to take the year off. In that year off I didn’t grow as a person and I feel empty all I do is sleep and play video games and go out once every two months to hangout. My parents are complaining that I have no girl friend , no life and I’m anti social. I’m not anti social I just feel so empty and lost that I don’t feel like doing anything anymore. I don’t even know if I can go back to school because of my grades were and I was lucky enough to get into school. I don’t want to move out I just want to go to school and come home as quickly as I can no friends nothing. This lack of growth in the last year has made me thinking to the point. Do I kill myself? What’s the point of living if I don’t finish school and get a job, why live if I’m just gunna work min wage my whole life? Lately I’ve been asking myself this everyday. What do I do with my life? Is there really a point in living if I don’t become a engineer, doctor, lawyer, etc ? All my friends are doing great but I’m just at the bottom and I don’t understand why they would hangout with a loser like me that isn’t even at school In my early 20s and I’m living at home. I’ve already missed out of going away for university.

"Ending a friendship (This post is insanely long FYI) I have a mate [17M, nearly 18] whose currently in a relationship with a girl [just turned 16] that he is completely infatuated by. He buys her stuff constantly, despite his financial situation (more on that later) and does lots of other things (also more on that later).  This friend of mine completely revolves his life around this one girl. He once told me he would do anything for her and that he would kill himself if they broke up (he's also depressed, which I think he should fix before even being in a relationship but it's too late now) he also said he would feel 100% responsible if she were to kill herself (she's not depressed. It was hypothetical. When I told him it wouldn't be his fault as everyone is responsible for their own actions, I simply received a ""shut up"". There have been many incident like this where I've truth bombed him and he's stuck his head in the sand and might as well be saying ""lalala I can't hear you!""  Unfortunately for my mate, these feelings don't appear to be reciprocated. He buys her gifts all the time, even though his mum can barely afford fuel due to her unemployment and the fact she's a single mum. He bought her a bath bomb and perfume and other stuff for her birthday (would be upwards of $50 (Australian dollars btw if that's even a concern) from a family that sometimes has $0 in their bank account when he didn't even get anyone else (including me) a gift for our birthdays. The girl doesn't even seem phased by his financial situation or his depression. If she cared, wouldn't she ask to not have gifts to help him out?. Not to mention that she hasn't bought A THING for my mate. In real life they seem like a stable couple but it's much worse.   The mate also purposely neglects invites from his mates (including me) for her. We invited him to see Star Wars: The Last Jedi and he messaged her about how he didn't really want to go (me and a mate broke into his Snapchat account. His iPad charger is broken and he can't afford another one so he gave us username and password to Snapchat so we could do his streaks which apparently matter. Also this is another testiment to his financial situation. Can't afford a cheapo third party cord for his iPad)  We looked through his messages and pretty much he's sending ""almost nudes"" thankfully with consent and a thotty dog filter picture (even though he would call anyone else that did it a thot to fit in) he also constantly asked to call on discord to which she replied only with ""sorry"" or ""can't"". No explanation whatsoever. Her friends are also incredibly irresponsible (thankfully he sees through that)  When my mate is talking to me or anyone else. All we get is a bombardment  ""what if she doesn't like me"" and other relationship jargon. I don't care but I have to pretend to. He cannot talk about anything else ever. It's just relationship this relationship that. I'm sick of it.  When he was at a very dark time in his life, me and 3 of my mates (2 girls including the girlfriend and one guy) made a group chat to talk about how we help him. We all talked very in depth except for the girlfriend. My mate asked her ""what do you think of all this were talking about (we went very in depth into his situation) to which her response was ""I don't know"" after saying NOTHING.   I'm sick of his ignorance. I'm sick of him neglecting me and the other lads. I'm sick of it all. He even tried to seize control from his girlfriend. She went to hi five me and he said ""why are you bringing him over here"" in an incredibly annoyed tone""   I know I'm only the ""when Chloe isn't present talk to him isntead"" guy. He doesn't care.   How do I cut him out of my life whilst causing the least ruccus possible?

"Accidentally kissing my friend after a party, what did i fuck up So there's this situation that happened once a week or two ago that kind of made my pretty-close-but-not-best friend dude friend feel...distant? I'm not sure but it coincides with the event and theres this subtle awkward ""accidentally"" distant attitude i feel coming from him, though I apologized for the kiss the very same day by text, that happened the morning after i slept in his bed at his party (we were 5 friends chatting in his bedroom until 6 am and the others left but we fell asleep spooning. madeout when we woke up. He has a girlfriend whos super jelly and absolutely doesnt want him to mess around, even tho he cheated on her a few weeks ago without telling. I have a boyfriend of 2 years that i love as well but we have a history of cheating on eachother and not knowing how to end this.  POINT IS, i really wanna have sex with my friend right here. Once or whatever, i don't really care, but i want my hots to go away and while hes only generically attractive, with very bland taste in women (im bisexual af and i don't understand most straight men tastes alright) , hes really more than that and has some kinks i share. Plus, everyone has had some sort of relationship or hookup with eachother in the past in our friend group, and him and I are the only pair that hasn't, so thats kind of anpther thing that makes the idea awkward. Not bright. I don't know what to feel about this. I slept in his bed again last night after an intimate party with our friends because the guest room was busy. At some point I was pretty sleepy and felt his hand on my panties (i didnt have pants on because its uncomfortable), but he was well asleep. I gradually felt a tingling growing round there and it slightly woke me up, and after some time he was starting to give me hand stuff, leaned in to kiss me, and then - maybe it was because i didnt bring my toothbrush and had bad breath, i hope not for the love of god, a few seconds after that he removed his hand from what i literally had been dreaming -fuck my life for making me that horny, grabbed my boob a little and then got his hand back to him and fell asleep. I dont know why he stopped, and thats the most awlward thing : what could that mean? If we had full on sex we could both agree it was wanted but a mistake, and reveal sexual tension between us. But right now it looks like i dont really attract him at all, but he still likes some intimacy, just not with me. Is that your analysis as well? What do you guys read in this?  Im well known for liking girls and have  short jaw length cherry red hair. A very cute face but Basically not your typical bombshell. Maybe that's what differences me from other girls he would dig having sex with?  Otherwise...im just lost. I have no way of finding out if hes attracted to me in the slighest at the moment , and if we're not meant to bang, i really feel like we lost this kinda vibe in the past months where he would randomly text me every few days and have long, intimate convos about feelings and things happening in our lives, even if were not best friends, we got along well. (We dont really hang out alone together though, that might have happened once or twice only) I really hope i wont lose this definitely from those two awkward, unwanted situations(?) , it would really suck cause I really like him as a friend.

"Hi, I'm pretty sure I'm suffering from depression, and probably have been for the last 18 months or so. It's only been lately that I feel like the rug has really been jerked out from under me, though. I think it started in mid-2004 when I became seriously ill. Between June and September 2004, I spent three weeks in the hospital, umpteen visits to the E/R, and finally, major surgery to correct the problem. Physically, I'm fine now. But we had no health insurance (long story), and when the hospital bills started rolling in, we tried our best to pay the bills, but there was just no way. We ended up filing bankruptcy, I lost my home business, and we very nearly lost our home. Ever since then, I've felt like I'm falling down a dark tunnel, even though the bankruptcy is over with. I was drinking part of this time, but have stopped, thinking that may have been causing the problem. But it's actually become worse since I've stopped.  Here's my ""symptoms"": I don't usually have trouble falling asleep, but I can't seem to stay asleep for more than a couple of hours. It's hard to go back to sleep, so I usually just get up. Weight gain because I find myself eating even when I'm not hungry. The ""comfort food"" thing, I guess. I tend to be a ""stress"" eater, and goodness knows I've had a lot of that lately! I used to enjoy camping and reading books (etc.), but I don't care about any of that anymore. I couldn't sit down now and read a book no matter how much I wanted to. I get through 5 or 6 pages, and totally lose interest. That's depressing in itself, because I used to love reading so much. I have no desire to get out and do anything. I literally close myself up in my spare bedroom every waking hour, only coming out to use the bathroom and to fix supper for my husband. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I'm not happy, but I can't pinpoint exactly what would make me happy. I honestly can't think of anything. I have no energy whatsoever.  I've been dealing with a TON of guilt over the bankruptcy. After all, the bankruptcy wouldn't have happened if I hadn't gotten sick, you know? I feel horrible for dragging my husband's credit down along with mine, but the way things were, I couldn't file bankruptcy by myself. Our credit was PERFECT until I got sick. My husband sold a bunch of his personal belongings to help pay bills, as did I, but it was so unfair for him to have lost his stuff on account of me. He's never once complained, but I still feel terrible. I've also been kicking myself for the loss of my home business. I can't help but feel like if it hadn't failed (I couldn't keep up with it during my illness), that we wouldn't have had to file bankruptcy. I've never been a crier, but I sure feel like it sometimes. I can't seem to do anything ""right"" these days. Irritable!!! Throwing stuff, being unreasonable, getting mad about petty things. The one thing I haven't experienced (thankfully) is suicidal thoughts. A few random ""morbid"" thoughts here and there, but nothing I'd ever act on. Last night I took several online self-tests, and all of them said I had mild to moderate depression. One even said severe. I guess the next step would be to go to the doctor, but I don't have a doctor. My sister is taking Zoloft for panic attacks and a PMS disorder, so I guess I'll ask her who she's seeing. What do they do ... just ask questions similar to the online questionnaires? Or? I've been reading about all the different kids of medicines, and found the information about Wellbutrin to be the most interesting. Obviously the doctor would know what I need better than I would, but I sure don't want to take something that's going to make me gain even more weight or feel like a zombie. At least one good thing, though. We do, thankfully, have insurance now. Another issue is my husband and family. To them, depression is something that people should be able to ""just shake off"". They don't understand that I CAN'T seem to ""shake it off"", otherwise, I gladly would. My husband is supportive in other ways, but he scoffed when my sister started taking Zoloft. To them, if they can't ""see"" the problem, it doesn't exist. I'm sure they don't mean to be ""mean"", but they just don't understand. Sorry for rambling.

"Only friend who consistently wants to hang out with me--I've started liking him less and less! help? No names or genders here, and I'm not getting into specifics on events just in case...   I have one friend who consistently wants to hang out, unlike my other friends, but the problem is that over the last few years I've started liking them less and less. They're fun to talk to and hang out with -usually- but their personality grates on me and there have been a few times when they have made me quite angry in ways that are difficult to reconcile. They can also end up being a downer though they have been working on it. An unknown quantity of my other friends also dislike them (I know a few for sure, but who knows how many they've pissed off in the meantime) so I either have to plan events without them (and they get upset) or not invite my other friends who dislike them.   We've known each other for years, and they consider myself and a few others very close friends but I have gotten the distinct impression it's one-sided. But they haven't done anything wrong (to ME) that would really merit breaking up a friendship so I've kept begrudgingly hanging out with them and chatting with them even though I'd rather not and just forget they exist. At one point I was one of very, very few friends they had, but I know they have a good consistent friend group now so...   I don't know! Advice, please?

"Opened up to a ""friend"" about my depression. It could've gone better. Hello, Reddit.  I've never posted here before. I'm a bit nervous about sharing this story (I'm very shy, even anonymously), so I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read it. I'm hoping that just getting it off my chest will help, even if only a little. Also, I'm sorry if this post rambles on a bit or is incoherent at all, I'm not in the best state of mind at the moment.  Earlier today, during our school's lunch break, I opened up to somebody I trusted about my depression and anxiety. I've been on a steep downward spiral recently, and this person had taken notice that something was wrong. She sat me down, grabbed us a couple of sodas, and told me to spill my guts. Normally, I would have simply told her that everything was fine, and made some lame excuse like ""I didn't sleep well last night"" or ""I'm just worried about my exam scores"". But this was the first time that anybody had ever reached out to try and help, so I decided to be truthful. I thanked her for offering to listen, and explained that I had never shared this with anybody else, so I might struggle to fully express myself. She was understanding, and told me to take as much time as I needed.   I was very careful not to unload everything on her, I basically told her exactly what I said at the start of this post: that I struggle with depression and anxiety, and that it's been getting a lot worse recently. Initially, it seemed like it was going well. She had several follow-up questions, some of which I wasn't entirely comfortable answering. However, for the first time in years I felt a genuine sense of hope, and felt like someone actually cared about me, so I answered them anyway. Eventually, she asked me what was causing all of this. I explained that while there are certainly things that contribute to my depression on a day-to-day basis, at the root of it, there isn't really a reason. It's just who I am, almost as if it's hardwired into my brain. It's hard to explain. Do any of you understand what I'm talking about?  Anyway, this is where things took a turn. While I was trying to explain that, she stopped me and said: ""I'm sorry, I can't do this. I offered to help cause I thought you were just having girl problems, or school problems, or something. I didn't realize you were totally emo. We're not in high school anymore. Besides, you're a guy, just toughen up"". That last part stung. I knew that was a common sentiment in our society, but to hear it coming from her, someone I've been friends with since high school, really took me by surprise. I didn't know what to say, so I didn't say anything. I just kind of looked down at my lap. We sat quietly for a moment, until she got up and started gathering her things. As she started to walk away I said: ""I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I wasn't trying to do that."" She looked back at me and said: ""Look, a big reason I'm friends with you is because of your positive attitude. It's infectious, and I love that about you. But if that's really just a mask, then you should probably just keep the mask on if we're going to continue being friends."", and then she left.   She texted me a few hours later and said: ""I hope you're able to move past your issues so our friendship can move forward"". I haven't responded, and don't plan to. I cry myself to sleep at night enough as it is without also worrying about maintaining a fake personality for her. I probably won't be opening up to anyone like that again anytime soon (except, of course, to all of you wonderful people on the internet). Deep down, I know that most of the people in my life wouldn't react the way she did. But I just don't think I can build up the motivation to try it, not when I struggle just to get up in the morning.  I want to thank you all again. Not just for reading my story, but for being a part of this community. Depression and anxiety really suck, and nobody should have to suffer through them alone.  ...I'm gonna go hug my pillow now.

" My first blog.. Man I used to wonder what a blog really is and now am blogging  ;o)  ... I am techie from india (I know nowadays being a techie from India is very dangerous) slogging out ... enjoying myself...But have some serious doubts about certain new things that I am discovering...  Quality  is a wonderful sounding word and my initiation into Project Management exposed me to a world of  jargons, metrics, templates and of course complete non-sense . I know that I may be chided for writing that, but let me clarify. On the set I am a devotee (right word) of the world of mathematics which never ceases to amaze me and Statistics, cos its just wonderful. During one of the great training days, it was conveyed, Statistics shouldn't be employed to misrepresent the data and now I wonder if it is the whole process is to do so. Information is available very abundantly and I guess we have surplus than we can consume. I wonder if generation of information is the basis of quality. Which comes to my first question ? Does adhering to quality standards mean ""keep your common sense @ home and come"". I wonder if the purists of statistics are the ones to satisfy. Cmon.. I wonder what possible information can be derived out of one's coffee breaks, one's mails and definitely the winner, How many lines of code I can dish out ? wonder if they know that I can eternally keep on putting braces, new lines, comments, star, hashes etc and they all contribute to code. Yeah Yeah I know, we have tools that can take care of these, but is this an indicator of a person's ability... Wonder what good is the information for... Begs the second question.. I get the common answer.. information may be useful down the line.. Yes it may be and may not be.. Going by the theory of probability it is equi-probable... I guess quality is used to ensure that the product being manufactured is in accordance with the best-practices in the industry (for starters) and more importantly, you learn from your current process to refine the same.. I think refinement is the catch and I guess it can be done in more than one way than generate some junk metrics..Wonder how the process can be refined from measuring no. of lines dished out in a day...

"I feel so lost Hi. I'm 15 year old girl from India and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. Everybody is passionate about something right? I'm not. I don't ever remember the last time in my life I was genuinely excited about anything. What makes everything worse is that in 1 month, I have to decide what I'm going to do with my life. Here in India, we don't get to pick our classes individually. In junior and senior year, you pick what stream you want (Commerce, Humanities, Medical or Engineering). The first two bore the hell out of me. I'd like to do Medical but I don't think I can study for another ~10 years after high school. I'm good at the Engineering subjects (Physics, Chemistry and Math) and I like CS but I've never really enjoyed doing it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bad at studying. I'm among the top kids at my school. Everybody thinks I have my life figured out and somehow that just makes it worse. I'm fucking terrified of what the future holds. I stay up whole nights crying just going over what is going to happen and trying to achieve some sort of clarity about what I'm going to do. I have tons of friends at school but I've never connected with anyone. There was this one guy I was really good friends with and had a crush on since 6th grade but he changed schools last year and we lost touch.

" I saw Leif yesterday.  For those of you who don't know he used to be my old roommate and a good friend of mine until he tried to rip me off anyway he could with rent and bills.  He also lied to me every opportunity he got, and then he had the audacity to tell Ryan that I lie all the time about everything.  I really could care less if I ever see him again.        Anyway, I was walking through the mall with Ryan and her mom yesterday and he and his daughter were looking at purses.  I saw him and I tried to get away from him without him noticing me.  It didn't work.  ""Yeah, that's right, Adam.  You just keep on walking,"" he said.  ""Okay,"" I responded and I kept on walking.  He responded with, ""Shmuck!""  And then he saw Ryan and said, ""Hey, baby.  How are you?""  I guess he still likes her.  I have no idea.  I really hope that's the last time I see him but I doubt it is.  A few weeks ago Ryan and I were driving back to her house and when we got to her street he was driving past us.  We turned around to see if that was him, and he turned around and drove past us again.  We turned down another street to get back to her house.  He passed us again.  Each time he covered his face, and Jennifer (another former roommate of ours who is now dating Leif) covered her face so I guess we wouldn't recognize her.  We never saw him again that day, but is he stalking me now?  Was he just bored so he got his two kids and girlfriend in the car and set out to find me?  Will I ever be rid of this guy?    Last night, I got home and Belinda (my roommate for another month) was in the kitchen.  She was leaving to go stay at a friend's house for the night, but before she left she told me that my room smelled bad.  She blamed it on my shoes or trash in my trash can.  She told me I needed to get some candles or an air freshener.  This caused a fight.  It was our first fight since moving into the place last August.  The only thing that I smell in my room is the air freshener that she put into my room a month ago that smells horrible.  My shoes are brand new and therefore do not stink.  The only trash I have in my room is paper.  My room is the only room in the house that actually smells good.  The rest of the house smells like her sausage and Slim Jims.  Anyway, I cleaned my room last night and hopefully she'll be happy now.  I only have three more weeks left in this place and after that I won't have to deal with this anymore.

"Why is it that I forget information about certain people?  Today, I've asked one of my female coworkers about what degree is she going for even though I keep asking that question when I forgot. She told me she's going for a dental bachelor. I've brought up that I've brought this up a bunch of times and she nodded.  I felt pretty embarrassed for asking that question and forgetting the answer a lot of times. (She isn't the only one though)  I think the reason why I forget is because the front end has a tendency to have its employees to have erratic working schedules thus it doesn't help when some of the employees go to college on their days off.  I'm twenty five year old woman who doesn't go to college because I'm not too wild about school.   I know a little bit about some of my coworkers, but I don't hang out with them outside the workplace because of many reasons.   1.) I don't always to make the effort to build a relationship with them because I don't have a lot to say except for questions such how's your day, what time are you working til, and anything new.  I will speak when I'm spoken to.  2.) I'm usually inside my head thinking a lot.   3.) I look for people with similar interests. (video games, animation, internet, vaporwave, and so forth on)  4.) I usually wait until someone talks to me.  5.) I don't open up to people easily.  6.) My social life is spent more online.  7.) The interests I have aren't mainstream (video games seem to be somewhat mainstream these days)  8.) I have autism while most of the employees don't have autism.   9.) I don't drive due to my fear of disability limiting my ability to drive safety.  10.) I don't talk a lot about my interests because I'm afraid I may obsess over them over and over again due to the point it may annoy co workers.  11.) I don't usually get involved with conversations with co workers because I need to focus on my job.  12.) When the time gets busy, I normally don't talk a lot. Again, I need focus on the job.   13.) I come from a solitary family from my mother's side. (introversion)  14.) I have a fear that I may say something that may offend them.  15.) I don't always have the motivation to socialize.  16.) I don't talk about my social life with family for reasons.  17.) I come across as serious, thus it doesn't help that I take a lot of things seriously   I'm currently looking for free volunteer drivers in my area so I could get to places and make and keep friends.  Thankfully, I have someone at home to take me to work, but not always available to take me. Thus I can get to work by walking. (My town is somewhat walk-able)  Back to retaining some information about co workers, I remember them I like some of the facts about them. I will put the first letter of my names of the co workers for privacy.  Example: B is  big on cats, she has an eighteen year old daughter who used to have a pet bunny long time ago.  She also love chinese as much as I do.   C loves to play video games just like I do.  He doesn't like the customer is always right policy.   I have a fifteen minute break for every five hours I work. The breakroom tends to vary with there's no people to there's lots of people.  Some of the co workers I know use their phone to browse on the internet while eating, and I don't want to bother them while they browse on their phone. Let's face it, it's getting tougher to socialize in real life when internet's taking over everyday life.   TL;DR I'd like to know why I lose track of facts of particular co workers and what could I do about it.",0,forget information certain people today asked female coworkers degree going asking question forgot told going dental bachelor brought brought bunch time nodded felt pretty embarrassed asking question forgetting answer lot time she not though think reason forget end tendency employee erratic working schedule doe not help employee college day off year old woman doe not college not wild school know little bit coworkers not hang outside workplace reason not make effort build relationship not lot say question day time working til new speak spoken to usually inside head thinking lot look people similar interest video game animation internet vaporwave forth on usually wait talk me not open people easily social life spent online interest not mainstream video game somewhat mainstream day autism employee not autism not drive fear disability limiting ability drive safety not talk lot interest afraid ob point annoy worker not usually involved conversation worker need focus job time get busy normally not talk lot again need focus job come solitary family mother side introversion fear say offend them not motivation socialize not talk social life family reason come serious doe not help lot thing seriously currently looking free volunteer driver area place make friend thankfully home work not available me work walking my town somewhat walkable retaining information worker remember like fact them letter name worker privacy example b big cat eighteen year old daughter used pet bunny long time ago love chinese do c love play video game just like do doe not like customer right policy minute break hour work breakroom tends vary people lot people worker know use phone browse internet eating not want bother browse phone let face it getting tougher socialize real life internet taking everyday life tlr like know lose track fact particular worker it
"girl So in the past 2-3 months i been talking to this one girl. I love everything about her and we really clicked together, seeing as we're both socially retarded. Literally everything's been looking up, i started working out, being generally happier and more carefree even in social environments.  I'm not exactly depressed, just don't really feel much emotion and I don't relate to people around me. Never been a fan of going out and I've had major problems getting to know anyone (I only have 1 very close friend, besides her). I've always had the feeling that I'm tolerated but not wanted whenever I'm around others, but this chick changed that completely. I actually started to look forward to waking up in the morning and meeting her at uni. On a side note we also like pretty much the same things - similiar music taste, similiar views, similiar feeling of being a reject and ofc vidya games, books and other shit.  I knew I was steadily falling in love with her (something I honestly thought impossible before) and just recently I found out she's got a boyfriend. I proceeded to spend the next 2 hours crying like a little bitch for the first time in over a decade. After that I couldn't even hit any fucking awp shots in cs cause I still had tears streaming from my eyes. My question is, have I reached the point of being pathetic enough that I should call it quits and neck myself?",1,girl past month talking girl love really clicked together seeing socially retarded literally looking up started working out generally happier carefree social environment not exactly depressed just not really feel emotion not relate people me fan going major problem getting know i close friend her feeling tolerated not wanted others chick changed completely actually started look forward waking morning meeting uni note like pretty thing similiar music taste similiar view similiar feeling reject ofc vidya game book shit knew steadily falling love something honestly thought impossible before just recently got boyfriend proceeded spend hour cry like little bitch time decade not hit fucking awp shot c cause tear streaming eye question is reached point pathetic quits neck myself

"Money and power are your friend, not human beings! I am cynical about friendship from my recent experience.

"Well, I have to admit that as a male I've always viewed my own depression as personal weakness. I still do, I can't help it ...it's a notion, feeling or philosophy or whatever that's been instilled from an early age. I know this is not a popular or realistic way to feel about depression. I mean, it's an illness, right. I've never been to a doctor to have my condition properly diagnosed or treated. At the moment, I really can't face my doctor with that sort of issue (btw, I'm in my mid-40s and I've suffered from depression since as long as i can remember) - I've learned to cope, in a fashion, but probably at the expense of a reasonable sense of social 'normality'- i.e. divorced, emotionally empty relationships, enormous amounts of time spent alone, dissatisfied working life, etc. One covers up & disguises the depression at work, at home, and wherever/whenever necessary...and then, when you're all alone, the demons can come out to play(or even before you're alone) - but at least you maintain the expected external masculine dignity, most of the time. For example, today my son wanted to come over to visit me but because I've been feeling so miserable and morbid and soaked in ennui this week, I made an excuse to put off his visit because I didn't want him to see me feeling low & depressed(and weak) and thus ruining his day/week. Instead, I went out on a freezing 10 mile walk alone to try to physically squash the depression. This is a regular occurrence - I get depressed, I hate myself for being weak, so I do something physical to try to alleviate the symptoms(and also to punish myself for feeling depressed)... it works...temporarily. In my mind, this sort of masochism is (or has been)preferable to taking alcohol, drugs (even prescribed medicines), fags, therapy or inflicting real self-harm and so forth because, at least, it keeps me feeling physically fit-physically balanced(and I guess that's important to me) even if it's not always an effective cure for one's depression. And I can keep up the public pretence that all is well. Sorry, back to the point - yes, it seems a lot of men do tend to suffer depression in silence (one wonders what the real percentage could be!).When I joined this group yesterday it was the first time I'd openly voiced the notion that I DO suffer from depression. Not so macho. Perhaps my condition is getting worse... or maybe I'm just feeling a little more realistic about what it is to be a male suffering from depression. Are there MANY women (or even men) out there who are truly sympathetic to males who suffer from depression? Unfortunately, I haven't seen much evidence out there so far?",1,well admit male viewed depression personal weakness do help it notion feeling philosophy instilled early age know not popular realistic way feel depression mean illness right doctor condition properly diagnosed treated moment really face doctor sort issue btw mids suffered depression long remember learned cope fashion probably expense reasonable sense social normality ie divorced emotionally relationship enormous amount time spent alone dissatisfied working life etc cover disguise depression work home whereverwhenever necessaryand then alone demon come playor alone maintain expected external masculine dignity time example today son wanted come visit feeling miserable morbid soaked ennui week excuse visit did not want feeling low depressedand weak ruining dayweek instead went freezing mile walk try physically squash depression regular occurrence depressed hate weak physical try alleviate symptomsand punish feeling depressed workstemporarily mind sort masochism or beenpreferable taking alcohol drug even prescribed medicine fag therapy inflicting real selfharm forth because least keep feeling physically fitphysically balancedand guess important me not effective cure depression public pretence well sorry point yes lot men tend suffer depression silence one wonder real percentage bewhen joined group yesterday time openly voiced notion suffer depression not macho condition getting worse maybe just feeling little realistic male suffering depression woman or men truly sympathetic male suffer depression unfortunately not seen evidence far
" Living in California I discovered a wonderful sport - Rugby. I know, I know what you must be thinking. Extreme pain. Trust me, the way girls play, it's not painful. It's like tackle football with the guys back in the South. If you don't want to land on the ground, just find somebody and land on them.  I can run pretty fast, so I'm a center (in a full squad of Rugby I play outside Center). Summer 7's (that's 7 minute halves, with 7 players on a full field) is geared for the backs and I absolutely love it! It's the closest I'll come to playing contact football, without the protection (mouth guard is it baby).  I play with some of the girls on the San Jose State team. They are a bit whacked (yes, Virg, I'm talking about you, and you Kelly). Last year on Thursday nights we'd practice on the beach then head over to the Beach Boardwalk and ride the roller coaster (and while most people hung on to the safety bar, Virg hung onto her breast, to each their own, I guess, Virg you little freak).

" I used to eat strawberry chapstick when I was a kid. When I say eat, I'm talking roll up the tube and take bites of it. I also used to have tragically chapped lips. I would always ask my dad for a new tube when we were in the checkout line of the grocery store and he kept buying them until he realized that no human can go through chapstick that quickly if you use it in the conventional way. Perhaps the fact that my lips could have been used as an alternative to sand paper gave it away and he soon found out about my snacking habits and refused to buy me anymore chapstick.  Now many years later, I have a slight obsession with chapstick and other lip products and if I may say so myself, I also have wonderfully soft lips. But, I have recently concluded that the ingestion of strawberry chapstick has lead to my many neuroses (we'll get into them a little later). I suppose they could have come from my parents divorce, my mom's abusive remarriage, the teasing I endured at school, some chemical imbalance or maybe even the time I crashed my tricycle and whacked my head on the concrete, but I've decided I like blaming it on chapstick instead.  It wasnt until a few years ago that I realized I really did have some strange neuroses and that most other people have very few or even none. In the last few months, I've noticed that they effect me more that I ever thought. I used to think ""oh thats just a quirk about me"" or ""hey, everyone is a little crazy about some things"".  I am not a lunatic by any means and most of my ""quirks"" are internal and really only effect me, but because I know I was not ALWAYS this way, it has really lead me to wonder *When does a person become who they are going to be and when is it too late to go back?*  Of course you can get some therapy or take some medication to rid you of many issues you may have, but after you have grown and matured enough to even realize you have issues then wouldnt any kind of ""intervention"" change WHO YOU are or force you to go through live pretending that you are someone else after you have been ""cured""? Is a ""cure"" really just self-denial about who you really are? Do you really want to do that?

"I've dealt with panic / anxiety / depression / ptsd for some time now.   I was in a 14 year abusive marriage and it has been two years since I left that marriage.  This past August was one year since my divorce was final.  I have two children, both boys, 6 and 10.  My ten year old has ADHD and depression.  I worry constantly for my kids because of what they saw during our marriage.   There are so many times I get so overwhelmed and just need to be around people who just ""get it.""  When I left, I brought my kids and myself home to my parents.  I have been with them since.  My mother, doesn't ""get it.""  She thinks that just because I left the marriage, I should be okay by now.  Well I guess 14 years may take a little longer than 2 years to fix.   I used to come here a long time ago.  I'm glad I came back.  I have seen so many familiar faces already and met new ones as well.  I just want a place where I feel I belong.  A place where I can go when I just need someone to be there.  It's been a long road, with many twists and turns ... I guess it's like that poem, the road less traveled.  I guess that means learning the hard way.

"Mom always trying to ask me uncomfortable questions and gets mad when I express my feelings about them I'm 20 years old and I've been with my boyfriend a little over 2 years. I know I'm young. Will my relationship last forever? There's a good chance it won't because both of us are very young. However, that doesn't mean I don't know how to be in a relationship or know if I love someone or not.  My mom has a bad habit of asking really odd, seemingly disrespectful questions to me and my brother about our relationships. A popular one she gives me is ""I don't think you love him, he's more like you friend."" She asked me this tonight over a phone call and I got upset with her and expressed how I feel uncomfortable and disrespected when she tells me things like that. Like she know's everything about my relationship, somehow, when I hardly tell her anything about it because her and my dad are quite old fashioned and very religious. She's told me things like this many times before, and usually I try to just try to brush it off, but I'm trying to get her to understand and communicate better with me and my brother.  She went on to say say ""but i'm your mom, I can ask things like that."" I understand she has a much different point of view, especially because she's older, but I just personally feel it's disrespectful to say that I don't love my boyfriend and that ""he's just a friend."" She kind of rolled her eyes at me, flatly said goodnight, and hung up.  Am I overreacting? i feel like I shouldn't be guilty for expressing my feelings of being uncomfortable with the questions she asks me. My parents have both lacked communication skills my whole life, and it's put us in a rocky relationship. I love my mom, but I'm just trying to get her to understand modern day relationships and me as pretty much a grown adult.

I am new here.  Decided to look up some info on the withdrawal effect of Effexor and decided that it was time to check out support as well.  I have suffered from depression since I was very young but was not diagnosed until my early twenties (I am 33 now)  I was not medicated until my husband decided he didn't want to be married anymore and the bottom fell out of my life.  At the time I needed something to help balance me out a bit.  I should have been medicated a long time ago :)  I still have times where it hits me but not nearly as severe as it used to.  I describe it as my black cloud coming over me.  I tell people when it's there as I am very open about my depression as I feel it may help someone else.,1,new here decided look info withdrawal effect effexor decided time check support well suffered depression young not diagnosed early twenty i now not medicated husband decided did not want married anymore fell life time needed help balance bit medicated long time ago time hit not nearly severe used to black cloud coming me tell people open depression feel help else

"Everything has changed...  About four years ago I was the typical loner. I was in the middle school. Nobody took me seriously, because my hobbies were not shared by anyone else. I'm from a small town, so it was difficult for me to find someone who actually liked the things I did. At the time I liked things like anime, video games and MLP. I am a 19 year old lass now and I only like video games now.     In the final grade of my middle school I met a girl. She was about two years younger but liked the same things I did. I was so happy to finally meet someone like me. We have bonded a lot and she was the first person I truly loved, except for my family, of course.    About two years ago we started to get distant. She kept talking to me about things I was uncomfortable with, but whenever I tried to talk about something that bothered me, she told me she was busy and didn't hear me out. It escalated in June of 2016.     I started talking to her friends, because they seemed like such wonderful people to me. Then we met up, all of us. She kept crying and making scenes. Few weeks before that, she accused me of liking HER friends more than I liked her. But when we all met, it seemed alright, save for her crying etc...      When I got home the next day, she told me off. Really badly. She told me to go to hell, called me all sorts of names and I feared... I feared I would never be able to find someone like her again.     I tried to end it. Swallowed sleeping pills and drank alcohol. I woke up the next day in a hospital. I woke up to a text from her. One that said she wishes my mother was torn apart by the girl's dogs...   It's been two years. I've gotten better, met friends that helped me out a lot and I will probably never be able to repay it. But this past of mine, it still haunts me. I don't think I'll ever be able to trust someone like this again. I have gotten so cynical and careless about everything... It still hurts.",1,changed year ago typical loner middle school took seriously hobby not shared else small town difficult actually liked thing did time liked thing like anime video game mlp year old lass like video game now final grade middle school met girl year younger liked thing did happy finally meet like me bonded lot person truly loved family course year ago started distant kept talking thing uncomfortable with tried talk bothered me told busy did not hear out escalated june started talking friend like wonderful people me met up u kept cry making scene week that accused liking friend liked her met alright save cry etc got home day told off really badly told hell called sort name feared feared able like again tried end it swallowed sleeping pill drank alcohol woke day hospital woke text her said wish mother torn apart girl dog year gotten better met friend helped lot probably able repay it past mine haunt me not think able trust like again gotten cynical careless everything hurt

" Well hello there... I know I'm being stupid to switch blogging sites, but I stumbled across this in my journey through the good ol' informsation superhighway today, and it looked pretty cool. (Don't bother pointing out that it doesn't have any more features that livejournal.com :-P I like the way this one *looks*, so nerrr). Still at TAFE... procrastinating...

"I'm getting annoyed constantly by one of my closest friends We've been friends since 8th grade, and she's a great friend, outgoing, funny, smart, the usual. We're pretty close, not absolute besties, but at the level where we can share memes with each other at 3am and not think it weird. But this year she's the only one of my friends from last year that has the same lunch as me, so I sit with her everyday. The problem is her bestest friend in the whole world also has the same lunch, so I'm always the awkward third wheel. I always try to help her when she needs it because a, she's my friend, and b, she doesn't have an easy home life. She never has enough to eat at lunch so I always bring something extra, and she also always needs rides everywhere. She says it's because her guardian is at work, or is visiting other family, is babysitting, but I think her family just doesn't want to give her rides places. I don't mind most of the time, but it's gotten to the point where she almost assumes we'll give her a ride when she needs it, and we can't always do that. She also stopped coming to lunch last week to go practice in the orchestra room, and I never even see her until orchestra class. I know something's not right, but every attempt to figure it out has gone unrewarded. I've made new friends this year through cross country and orchestra, and they have the same lunch I do. I went and sat with them one day, but my other friend looked almost mad when I told her I was sitting with them just for that day. It's okay for you to ignore me most of lunch and then not even show up and not answering me when I ask where you've been, but I can't make new friends and sit with them every now and then? I'm just not sure where to go from here, because I don't want to stop being friends, I really don't, but I just feel like my new friends can be better friends, and friends I can relate to better. I just don't want to do or say something I'll regret, especially because I know her life at home isn't great and she needs friends, but she shouldn't be pushing her problems onto me either ",0,getting annoyed constantly closest friend friend th grade great friend outgoing funny smart usual pretty close not absolute besties level share meme am not think weird year friend year lunch me sit everyday problem bestest friend world lunch awkward wheel try help need a friend b doe not easy home life eat lunch bring extra need ride everywhere say guardian work visiting family babysitting think family just doe not want ride place not mind time gotten point assumes ride need it that stopped coming lunch week practice orchestra room orchestra class know not right attempt figure gone unrewarded new friend year cross country orchestra lunch do went sat day friend looked mad told sitting just day okay ignore lunch not not answering ask been make new friend sit then just not sure here not want stop friend really not just feel like new friend better friend friend relate better just not want say regret especially know life home not great need friend not pushing problem
"So dramatic 😪 My best friend and I were in the same school ever since we were 4 years old. But then, I had to leave for a different high school while she stayed with most of our friends. We didn’t grow apart, but we spent most of our time with different people, which can change a person. I’d like to think that I did not change a whole lot (probably true :’) ) but my best friend has been hanging out with some of our friends and they’ve been affecting her attitude in a way, and she’s starting to become the same people we would always laugh at for being stupid and ignorant and petty. We talked about it and she agrees that’s she’s changed, but doesn’t want her change to affect our friendship. What do you think we should do?",0,dramatic best friend school year old then leave different high school stayed friend did not grow apart spent time different people change person like think did not change lot probably true best friend hanging friend affecting attitude way starting people laugh stupid ignorant petty talked agrees changed doe not want change affect friendship think do
"Ever Feel FB ""Friends"" Are Lying Out Their Asses? For real. How the fuck can people post about life being great, life is so good, and being blessed? It's like they want to rub your nose in it how wonderful their life is. While you're wallowing in alcohol/drugs, in a room by yourself, contemplating suicide.   Sometimes, I just want to call people out on this bullshit but I don't post on FB anymore. No possible way these people are that happy and enjoy life so much. Is it just narcissists? Or are people really this happy and get all the luck in the world?",1,feel fb friend lying ass real fuck people post life great life good blessed like want rub nose wonderful life is wallowing alcoholdrugs room yourself contemplating suicide sometimes just want people bullshit not post fb anymore possible way people happy enjoy life much just narcissist people really happy luck world
"I can't handle this anymore I have no perspective in life. I am 19 but I feel like a 50 year old alcoholic. When I drink, I can't stop. Just for your information: I am ""only"" a social drinker. But the thing is, I am done. I don't know how I could get old. I can't handle life now even though I get everything spoonfed by my parents. I don't know how I could handle it later. I'm at that point where I don't even care if a car hits me. The thought of death is just so relieving. Btw I'm incredibly drunk (again) right now and I just wanted to share this.",1,handle anymore perspective life feel like year old alcoholic drink stop just information only social drinker thing is done not know old handle life spoonfed parent not know handle later point not care car hit me thought death just relieving btw incredibly drunk again right just wanted share this
"The days are manageable; it's the years that get me Day to day, aside from the struggle with getting out of bed, I can do OK. Put the mask on, survive the day, go home, go back to sleep (I guess I'm what they call high-functioning). The idea that I'm going to have to do this forever until I die makes me want to move that date up a bit.",1,day manageable year day day aside struggle getting bed ok mask on survive day home sleep i guess highfunctioning idea going forever die make want date bit
