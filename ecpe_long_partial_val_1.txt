 (1, 5),(1, 8),
1,depressed,depression,Hi  I am pretty sure I am suffering from depression  and 
2,null,null,probably have been for the last 18 months or so
3,null,null,It is only been lately that I feel like the rug has really been jerked out from under me  though 
4,null,null,I think it started in mid2004 when I became seriously ill 
5,null,null,Between June and September 2004  I spent three weeks in the hospital  umpteen visits to the E  R  and finally  major surgery to correct the problem 
6,null,null,Physically  I am fine now 
7,null,null,But we had no health insurance  long story   and
8,null,null,when the hospital bills started rolling in  we tried our best to pay the bills  but there was just no way 
9,null,null,We ended up filing bankruptcy  I lost my home business  and
10,null,null,we very nearly lost our home 
11,null,null,Ever since then  I have felt like I am falling down a dark tunnel  even though the bankruptcy is over with 
12,null,null,I was drinking part of this time  but 
13,null,null,have stopped  thinking that may have been causing the problem
14,null,null,But it is actually become worse since I have stopped 
15,null,null,Here is my  symptoms  
16,null,null,I do not usually have trouble falling asleep  but
17,null,null,I can not seem to stay asleep for more than a couple of hours 
18,null,null,It is hard to go back to sleep  so
19,null,null,I usually just get up 
20,null,null,Weight gain because I find myself eating even when I am not hungry 
21,null,null,The  comfort food  thing  I guess 
22,null,null,I tend to be a  stress  eater  and
23,null,null,goodness knows I have had a lot of that lately 
24,null,null,I used to enjoy camping and reading books  etc    but
25,null,null,I do not care about any of that anymore 
26,null,null,I could not sit down now and 
27,null,null,read a book no matter I wanted how much to
28,null,null,I get through 5 or 6 pages  and 
29,null,null,totally lose interest
30,null,null,That is depressing in itself  because I used to love reading so much 
31,null,null,I have no desire to get out and do anything 
32,null,null,I literally close myself up in my spare bedroom every waking hour  only coming out to use the bathroom and to fix supper for my husband 
33,null,null,I feel like I have nothing to look forward to 
34,null,null,I am not happy  but
35,null,null,I can not pinpoint exactly what would make me happy 
36,null,null,I honestly can not think of anything 
37,null,null,I have no energy whatsoever 
38,null,null,I have been dealing with a TON of guilt over the bankruptcy 
39,null,null,After all  the bankruptcy would not have happened if I had not gotten sick  you know 
40,null,null,I feel horrible for dragging my husband is credit down along with mine  but
41,null,null,the way things were  I could not file bankruptcy by myself 
42,null,null,Our credit was PERFECT until I got sick 
43,null,null,My husband sold a bunch of his personal belongings to help pay bills  as did I  but
44,null,null,it was so unfair for him to have lost his stuff on account of me 
45,null,null,He is never once complained  but
46,null,null,I still feel terrible 
47,null,null,I have also been kicking myself for the loss of my home business 
48,null,null,I can not help but 
49,null,null,feel like if it had not failed  I could not keep up with it during my illness   that we would not have had to file bankruptcy
50,null,null,I have never been a crier  but
51,null,null,I sure feel like it sometimes 
52,null,null,I can not seem to do anything
53,null,null, right  these days 
54,null,null,Irritable  
55,null,null,Throwing stuff  
56,null,null,being unreasonable  getting mad about petty things
57,null,null,The one thing I have not experienced  thankfully  is suicidal thoughts 
58,null,null,A few random  morbid  thoughts here and  but 
59,null,null,there
60,null,null,nothing I would ever act on
61,null,null,Last night I took several online self  tests  and
62,null,null,all of them said I had mild to moderate depression 
63,null,null,One even said severe 
64,null,null,I guess the next step would be to go to the doctor  but
65,null,null,I do not have a doctor 
66,null,null,My sister is taking Zoloft for panic attacks and a PMS disorder  so
67,null,null,I guess I will ask her who she is seeing 
68,null,null,What do they do 
69,null,null,just ask questions similar to the online questionnaires 
70,null,null,Or 
71,null,null,I have been reading about all the different kids of medicines  and 
72,null,null,found the information about Wellbutrin to be the most interesting
73,null,null,Obviously the doctor would know what I need better than I would  but
74,null,null,I sure do not want to take something that is going to make me gain even more weight or feel like a zombie 
75,null,null,At least one good thing  though 
76,null,null,We do  thankfully
77,null,null, have insurance now 
78,null,null,Another issue is my husband and family 
79,null,null,To them  depression is something that people should be able to  just shake off  
80,null,null,They do not understand that I CANT seem to  shake it off   otherwise  I gladly would 
81,null,null,My husband is supportive in other ways  but
82,null,null,he scoffed when my sister started taking Zoloft 
83,null,null,To them  if they can not  see  the problem  it does not exist 
84,null,null,I am sure they do not mean to be  mean   but
85,null,null,they just do not understand 
86,null,null,Sorry for rambling 
87,null,null,Any suggestions or 
88,null,null,thoughts

 (13, 4),
1,null,null,I feel alone
2,null,null,Hi I am writing this here because I feel as if I have no one to talk to
3,null,null,but it is occurred to me that I am never truly happy with my life 
4,null,null,I am 19 a male at that I have seem to never be happy as hard as try to be
5,null,null,it never goes as planned 
6,null,null,I have no idea
7,null,null,the root of my problem or problems
8,null,null,I have tried a number of things plenty of options were given
9,null,null,and I am just getting deeper and deeper in a hole 
10,null,null,I am in a house with my mother and my sister
11,null,null,but I feel like I am in everything I am in alone 
12,null,null,That is what I hate the most 
13,depressed,loneliness,The loneliness

 (13, 17),
1,null,null,How is it going  all who read 
2,null,null,My name is Greg
3,null,null, I am 19 and 
4,null,null,have had depression for basically as long as I remember
5,null,null,Here is a brief history of my journey through depression and the treatments I have endeavored 
6,null,null,I began on lexapro 
7,null,null,It seemed to be helping
8,null,null,and then it quit on me  or perhaps vice versa  
9,null,null,After that I tried zoloft  and wellbutrin  but 
10,null,null,to the same effect
11,null,null,Then I turned my world to narcotics  mainly  marijuana and DXM  
12,null,null,They helped ALOT  but
13,depressed,stigma and guilt,because they are illegal  I felt a constant public stigma and guilt 
14,null,null,I could not take it  despite the amazing effects of both drugs 
15,null,null,I am now taking Paxil CR  but
16,null,null,I am going to quit it because it is not working 
17,null,null,I am beginning to lose hope altogether 
18,null,null,It seems apparent to me that SSRIs just are not for me  or maybe I just have not found the right one 
19,null,null,The real problem with depression is that you have to wait a month on each drug just to see it
20,null,null,it is going to work 
21,null,null,Those months can feel like years 
22,null,null,Anyways  that is who I am 
23,null,null,I hope to make a few friends here  and 
24,null,null,a lot of advice as well
25,null,null,Does anyone one else share these symptoms  if so  and 
26,null,null,if you think you can help contact me please 
27,null,null,Chronic fatigue  lack of motivation  desire  inability to enjoy life  insomnia  including the other obvious and supplementing symptoms 
28,null,null,The real killer is
29,null,null,I know I have the potential to be someone great  but
30,null,null,I have to become happy first 
31,null,null,Greg

3,null,null,i have done everything under the sun to try and help myself 
4,null,null,counseling  confiding in anyone who will listen  taken all different types of medication  and
5,null,null,the only thing that has ever made me feel okay is not being sober 
6,null,null,idc what it is i will do it 
7,depressed,hate being sober,i fucking hate being sober 
8,null,null,i just want to get fucked up and lay in bed and watch shit on my laptop
9,null,null,and i literally have no reason to be so depressed
10,null,null,but the only thing that helps is drugs 
11,null,null,not looking for moral support or anything i just need to vent without being looked down on and judged 
12,null,null,thx

 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Has anyone been depression free for 5  years 
2,null,null,I get better
3,null,null,then I get much worse  it is a cycle that will not stop 
4,null,null,I am wondering if there any older redditors that had severe depression as a young adult  and are now completely free from it 
5,depressed,kill me,Depression is almost certainly going to kill me  whether it is the harmful way I cope to stay alive day to day  or more directly if I by some miracle can get my hands on a gun 
6,null,null,Is there anyone that has been cured and not worries about depression creeping back 
7,null,null,How did you do it 
80 14
 (6, 11),
1,null,null,I do not think I was cut out to survive in the world 
2,null,null,I can not make phone calls 
3,null,null,I can not drive 
4,null,null,I can not get a job and 
5,null,null,work like everyone else

9,null,null,I am graduating and 
10,null,null,leaving college behind soon
11,null,null,I know I will not be able to make it in the working world like everyone else 
12,null,null,I do not think I was supposed to live past high school 
13,null,null,I add nothing to the world 
14,null,null,I am a leech on society 
82 17
 (3, 7),
1,null,null,Nice to see you too  
2,null,null,How are you today 
3,depressed,negativity and darkness,I think you really have hit the mark on what I was trying to express with this question  all the negativity and darkness that is contained in almost every media outlet you can name 
4,null,null,The disasters you mention  such real human tragedy but the way the media went after it was appalling and seemed to be muddled in politics and ratings 
5,null,null,As for those forensic shows  ugh 
6,null,null,I used to be able to watch them but way before this recent  episode  of mine I stopped 
7,null,null,I could not stand the heartache of knowing what evil lurks out there 
8,null,null,Where I work now one of the first friends I made was a gentleman who has since retired 
9,null,null,He told me that he did not read the news  watch TV or listen to the radio  except for light jazz  because he found that to do so was just too much pain  it did not  serve  him to subject himself to that kind of pain 
10,null,null,He seemed to be generally very happy and upbeat to me so there must be something to it 
11,null,null,As for your friend  that is a tough one
12,null,null,but maybe since she is your friend she might understand if you explain to her how incredibly painful her TV choices are on you 
13,null,null,Does she ever read or 
14,null,null,post here
15,null,null,Anyway  it is GREAT talking with you again
16,null,null,and I look forward to the next chat 
17,null,null,I hope you have a wonderful day and weekend

 (30, 15),
1,null,null,Get myself to be more active  alive 
2,null,null,So  my depression is getting worse and worse since a few years 
3,null,null,I am in law school and
4,null,null,I am in the last year of preparation 
5,null,null,in our country  this is THE BUSIEST TIME ever for those students 
6,null,null,like  they start studying at 7 in the morning at stay until 11 in the night at the library 
7,null,null,nonstop studying for 1  15 years in preparation for the big exams 
8,null,null,I started last october 
9,null,null,it is july 
10,null,null,I have maybe studied on two or three days  seriously 
11,null,null,the other time  I just sit at home  in a kind of weird freeze 
12,null,null,I am BORED out of my mind  my brain is longing for some activity  and
13,null,null,I actually really want to be all busy and studying and feel like I have a purpose 
14,null,null,It is like I know exactly how important it is now  and
15,null,null,my brain is screaming at me to get my books out and start doing I want what to do 
16,null,null,But I just sit here 
17,null,null,Heck  if I am procrastinating so bad  at least I could have fun  party  travel  meet people 
18,null,null, see the world
19,null,null, at least not waste my time or waste it in a way that is at least fun
20,null,null,But I am still sitting here 
21,null,null,Like in a shock 
22,null,null,It feels like it is too late for the studying thing
23,null,null, exams are in spring
24,null,null,and I have no idea about the subjects and skip all classes I am paying for 
25,null,null,and I have no idea what else to do with my time 
26,null,null,It does not help that over the last two years  I kinda developed an eating disorder with anorexic  bulimic and binge  eating  tendencies that also made my health decline 
27,null,null,I am constantly thinking about numbers  looking up nutritional infos  reading medical studies  looking at food online  it is taking so much space in my head although I am quite  close to my goal   and
28,null,null,I should not even worry because if I keep doing what I planned  restrict for another 4  5 weeks  then slowly up my calories until I no longer lose weight  stay at maintenance and start to slowly incorporate exercise to finally be healthy  eating healthy  and exercising to maintain good health   there is no reason to be so occupied with this topic 
29,null,null,Any idea how to get myself to get up and DO SOMETHING 
30,depressed,burn down,The sitting around is what is probably making me most depressed  because I watch my life burn down and kind of can not do anything about 
31,null,null,PLEASE do not suggest to get professional help 
32,null,null,I know  it is the most rational thing  especially for the eating thing  but right now  I just can not  I really can not
84 16
 (4, 13),
1,null,null,When people ask you what you did for the weekend  or 
2,null,null,for your birthday  etc
3,null,null,I have no idea how to respond 
4,depressed,numb,My emotions have become so numb that I can not feel anything
5,null,null,so therefore I can not enjoy anything I used to like doing 
6,null,null,I literally just go to work everyday for 8 hours  
7,null,null,come home and browse the news and reddit and listen to music  trying to entertain myself but never really succeeding
8,null,null,There is nothing I can enjoy 
9,null,null,So when someone asks me what I did I just say some crap like I just relaxed at home or something  I do not know what else to say 
10,null,null,It is the worst part about depression for me 
11,null,null,Not being able to enjoy anything 
12,null,null,I do not even look forward to coming home from work because it is not like I have anything to enjoy at home 
13,null,null,It is all the same dullness 
14,null,null,I would probably work 12  14 hours a day seven days a week if I could because it would not bother me at all 
15,null,null, I am not missing out on anything
16,null,null,Too bad they do not because they do not want to pay overtime for me of course 
85 7
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,Existing hurts
2,depressed,distract myself from life,I always feel like I am just trying to distract myself from life with anything I can games  drugs  moving around because sitting down and not being able to do anything 
3,null,null,often something I do
4,null,null,just hurts 
5,null,null,I hate how slow and irrevelent
6,null,null,I am 
7,null,null,I am so held up by anxiety and indecision that it is hard to even type

 (6, 6),
1,null,null,When luck does not work in your favor  and
2,null,null,neither does bad luck
3,null,null,So many people die of accidents everyday 
4,null,null,Those who do not deserve it  
5,null,null,those who have happy nice lives they want that to live
6,depressed,wanting to get hit,Yet here I am  wanting to get hit by a bus everytime I cross the road but never do

2,depressed,depressed,I have been depressed  both clinically recognized or otherwise  for around 15 years
3,null,null, I am 20 for the record  
4,null,null,After 3  4 months of a  good  period I am finding that I am slipping back into that  black hole  
5,null,null,I am looking for support and very happy to offer everyone all I have to help  even if it is little 
6,null,null,I have not been to a therapist in 2 years and
7,null,null,I have not been on medication steadily for an even longer while  although I think I needed both in the meantime save for the past few  happy  months  
8,null,null,Anyway  take care everyone 
9,null,null,I know I am new here
10,null,null,but if anyone feels like they are cracking up  feel free to PM me

 (1, 2),
1,depressed,lonely,I am so fucking unbearably lonely
2,null,null,I have no job  no friends 
3,null,null,and nothing even close to an SO 
4,null,null,I have never even been on a date 
5,null,null,That is a pipe dream of course
6,null,null,I would not date someone as disgusting as me
7,null,null,so why should anyone else in the first place 
8,null,null,But I can not stop desperately wanting to be loved  to be touched 
9,null,null,not even sexually necessarily tho that too  but 
10,null,null,just be held  kissed
11,null,null,Anyone  I do not give a fuck anymore boy or girl just someone
12,null,null,anyone please
13,null,null,It is never happened and
14,null,null,it feels like it never will 
15,null,null,I feel like I am starving to death 
16,null,null,I can not shake this need
17,null,null,I have never really felt before and
18,null,null,it is every damn minute 
19,null,null,it is so damn funny though I shrink away from even the slightest of contact with another human 
20,null,null,in the rare occasion I am in public
21,null,null,I bury myself in my phone and 
22,null,null,hope desperately no one acknowledges me
23,null,null,no one ever does
24,null,null,but I am always still afraid they will 
25,null,null,how fucking pathetic  is not it 
26,null,null,add this to the list of things that make me wanna rip my skin open

1,null,null,For those on antidepressants  is it working 
2,null,null,Alternatives to antidepressants 
3,null,null,Okay so I am going back to a psychiatrist next week for my depression 
4,null,null,I have been going since high school and
5,depressed,suicidal ideation,over the years have had depressive thoughts  suicidal ideation  lack of motivation and interest  high anxiety  numbness  hopelessness  etc etc 
6,null,null,recently it is been coming back 
7,null,null,I have been on Zoloft which made me feel like a numb zombie and bupropion which I did not feel was working

9,null,null,a mood stabilizer that did not really help
10,null,null,I have since gotten off medication by my own choice but
11,null,null,the problems are coming back 
12,null,null,Generally I do not like rx drugs and
13,null,null,would rather do it naturally
14,null,null,but it is not going away 
15,null,null,My question to people is what antidepressants have worked  how long have u been using them  and 
16,null,null,has ur depression improved
17,null,null,Should I take it for the long term 
18,null,null,And what alternative methods have worked for you guys 
91 10
 (5, 2),
1,null,null,I wish I was 15 again  when nothing really mattered I am 21 now
2,null,null,and all I want is to be 15 again  when I did not have any worries  when I did not know what depression was  when I had interests  when I did not have existential crisis  when I did not question every little thing about myself
3,null,null, I was just able to BE 
4,null,null,Not to say everything was perfect back then  but
5,depressed,feeling emptier and emptier,every year it starts feeling emptier and emptier 
6,null,null,Even though my life has technically better  I feel so empty and dead 
7,null,null,I do not even want to know what my brain will be like in 10 years 
8,null,null,Even though realistically my life is better off now 
9,null,null,I still want to die

5,null,null,This is my worst episode ever 
6,null,null,I have had depression for 8 years  and 
7,null,null,have been ashamed and embarrassed by it
8,null,null,As my life seems to be ebbing away  I have come out with it and 
9,null,null,seeking psychiatric help
10,null,null,My problem has been that I work in psychiatry and have feared loosing my job  career 
11,null,null,It means everything to me 
12,null,null,It is the only thing I have and could not bare seeing it go down the toilet 
13,null,null,Friends do not understand and 
14,null,null,know how to discuss the topic with me
15,null,null,My family does not know as it would devastate an already broken family 
16,null,null,For 8 years I have suffered in silence 
17,null,null,cried silent screams
18,depressed,tormented, been tormented by my own brain 
19,null,null,I hate imagining living a life like this especially when the long term effects I am reminded of every day  my patients  
20,null,null,The only person I had was my ex girlfriend  we split last year 
21,null,null,CAUSE 
22,null,null,me 
23,null,null,Stress got the better of me 
24,null,null, my thinking became screwed and I have lost her  for life
25,null,null,She was the only one I could talk to  some one I had known for  12 odd years 
26,null,null,Depression has ruined my life 
27,null,null,This episode has been an eye opener 
28,null,null,This is the first time planet earth is hearing about my struggle 
29,null,null,Something  which may have otherwise been lost 
30,null,null,My secrets buried with me 
31,null,null,Do not confuse this as a suicide note 
32,null,null,It is not 
33,null,null,It is me talking about things in this way for the first time 
34,null,null,I am over the crisis point but nowhere near my usual self and 
35,null,null,need to sort my medicines out with my doctor as soon as possible
36,null,null,I have had a brave chat with my boss who is going to sort out a psychiatrist in the next 10 days  all being well 
37,null,null,I have only taken one OD in 1998 with a serious intent to kill myself 
38,null,null,Doctors said I survived as I woke up 
39,null,null,For years I have avoided talking about it 
40,null,null, never wanted to see a psychiatrist but realize now  well for now  that there is 2 people inside me
41,null,null,One is me  the other is depression and
42,null,null,to stand the best chance of staying well and keeping
43,null,null,well then I need to face I have a problem 
44,null,null,Around 3 weeks ago I was so actively suicidal  I was thinking of jumping off a bridge into the river  i searched the internet for ways to kill myself

1,null,null,10 years I have been managing depression and
2,null,null,I was doing well  until last Monday 
3,null,null,Quick back story  38  m  Ireland 
4,null,null,I was a competitive Powerlifter and 
5,null,null,represented my country on 2 occasions with great success
6,null,null,My life was lifting  setting goals  reaching targets  smashing PBs  all helped with creating a future for myself 
7,null,null,I started to feel unwell around December 2016 and developed a persistent  non  productive cough 
8,null,null,Series of tests led me to an echocardiograph where it was discovered I was suffering Heart Failure 
9,null,null,Dilated Cardio Myopathy caused by a viral infection  left my hearts function at 20EF 
10,null,null,Apparently I had a few months to live if I had not caught it 
11,null,null,Ironically  now  I wish they had not discovered it 
12,null,null,My world flipped upside down 
13,null,null,No Powerlifting  no excessive exercise  restricted fluid intake  no over exertion  meds for the rest of my life  when my heart goes irregular 
14,null,null,regular reviews in my heart clinic  multiple ambulance emergency rides to AampE
15,null,null,Hospital  pharmacy  hospital  pharmacy 
16,null,null,Seems to be my life for the past year 
17,null,null,Last Monday I snapped 
18,null,null,It hit me 
19,depressed,crashing,Everything I lost came crashing in on me 
20,null,null,I got in my car  
21,null,null,picked a place I knew well to ram my car into at 120 mph
22,null,null,I was screaming at myself to do it 
23,null,null,My left hand steering towards the end 
24,null,null,my right hand steering me to survive 
25,null,null,An image of my dog in my mind kept me on the road 
26,null,null,I knew she would miss me too much 
27,null,null,I am still very low now despite all my meds 
28,null,null,I still wish I had gone through with it 
29,null,null,I still think of going to the Cliffs of Moher and jumping 
30,null,null,What a beautiful place to end it 
31,null,null,I am dreading the road ahead because I know how Rocky it is going to be 
32,null,null,Help me please

1,null,null,I am Weakest At Night 
2,null,null,I do not understand the reason for this  but
3,null,null,for as long as I can remember I have always been weakest during the night time 
4,depressed,weak mentally,I feel weak mentally  emotionally  physically  internally 
5,null,null,I feel like I can not go on  like I can not keep fighting 
6,null,null,like I have had enough 
7,null,null,I freeze over  my body locks up  my fear paralyzes me  and
8,null,null,my mind becomes my enemy 
9,null,null,Night seems endless because I can not see much of anything no matter where I try to look 
10,null,null,From minor fears to worst nightmares stalk me like I am nothing but an insignificant prey who is time has come 
11,null,null,I am exhausted and need sleep  but
12,null,null,only nightmares haunt me or the fear of being attacked while I am immobile by unconsciousness 
13,null,null,And yet  though a part of me yearns for light  for the warm comfort of the sun  it only depresses me 
14,null,null,In the light I can see what I truly am  I can see a reflection of something I have grown to hate 
15,null,null,When I look at my reflection I want to smash the mirror
16,null,null,so I can no longer see the truth of my insignificant existence 
17,null,null,In the light I can see everyone else  either continuing on with their lives without a thought of me or a second glance 
18,null,null,Or I see other people like me suffering and
19,null,null,it both hurts and gives me a strange  and possibly  a cruel comfort 
20,null,null,I hate seeing other is suffer  but
21,null,null,I am so insignificant I am helpless that I might as well be dead 
22,null,null,I need the light and
23,null,null,yet it hurts me
