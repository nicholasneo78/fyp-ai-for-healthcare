Just another night. Another night of feeling lonely and just wondering what I did wrong in life to deserve this unhappiness. I have never felt a pain stronger than being rejected by the love of your life. The person who gives you a purpose. The person who is supposed to make everything better. You would give your life for this person and they just do not love you anywhere near the same.,You would give your life for this person and they just do not love you anywhere near the same.
"Is it possible to fake depression? I have been feeling bad for about 7 months now. There are periods where I cry on a daily basis, I never feel like talking, I struggle concentrating and collecting thoughts, I feel such an extreme sadness inside of me also in happy situations, I am exhausted all the time even if I sleep 10 hours straight, I often have headaches, I am completely alone and I find it difficult to do anything. There are nights where it is unbearable. I think about my situation: I am completely alone, I am failing at anything because I am so weak I cannot handle my feelings, I feel guilt for everything that happens around me, I cannot carry on anymore, I am always here in this dark place and I feel that I have no right to be like this. I used to self harm and I still have many scars on my skin, but I think to be disrespectful to those who truly struggle then I promised to cut never again. I should not have the right to do so. My life is void, I am void, and I cannot get the energy to do anything ever. I do not get pleasure from what I used to love, nothing seems to make me feel something good. I can enjoy no series, no book, no videogame like I used to. I think I do not even deserve to eat. I am just trying to pity myself giving myself depression, but I do not have it. Is it possible to fake depression? Could it actually be an excuse for me to not take responsibility of the failure that I am?","Is it possible to fake depression?

"Imagine being attractive Imagine what it would be like to be desired, to have someone look at you not in disgust or ambivalence. It is all just a roll of the dice, It is too bad if you roll poorly you will be treated objectively worse. I wish I was born attractive.. fuck",-
"Best moment to have anxiety It is 3:30am, I am tired, want to get up early, and guess what ? My brain decided this : Instead of sleeping, why do not you become half crazy, thinking about your future (should I say the ""lack"" of future ?). Here, have some cravings for cigarettes, my pleasure, and of course i know you do not have cigarettes, do you think I am stupid ? The middle of the night is the best moment for thinking of smoking when you cannot smoke. Think of your loneliness. Think of you inexistant social life. You are 25 and you have no job. You are living with your boring mother, with whom you literally quarel with every day. She probably think you are a piece of shit. You never had any girlfriend, and you probably will not. Almost 26, do not count on me to congratulate you.. Your only sunbeam will be at New year is Eve, when you will travel to see your best friends. But guess what, since you have no money at all, you probably will have to work to sell fu**ng pastries, and because of that you will not be able to see your friends. Then you will continue to argue with your mother. Living on the couch. Selling pastries. In entire loneliness. God only knows how long. The funny thing (say my brain) is this : ""you are a loser, you lived and worked on your own not so long ago. But you are a child, you have the power to do what you want, where you want. You are 25, for God is sake, so why do not you move your ass ?"" Leave me alone brain, I already know all that. I would be a king if I could. But I will not. Funny how despair can suck the marrow of your life, how even when you are ready to fall in the deepest pit, you have absolutely no will to catch the rope. TL ; DR : FML. Have a good day/night everyone !","The middle of the night is the best moment for thinking of smoking when you cannot smoke.

"hi, I am a 21 year-old male from the uk, over the past few months I have become increasingly depressed. I am always acting the joker and appear to be happy at university and work but every night I go to bed and hope that I will not wake up in the morning. For the past 3 or 4 years I have had an overwhelming feeling that I will not live very long and over the past few months I have the sensation that I will die very soon. my depression also leads me to get very angered. I have never spoken to anyone about this.","hi, I am a 21 year-old male from the uk, over the past few months I have become increasingly depressed."

I have never had manual play (handjob) I have never had oral on me (blowjob) I have never been lustfully fucked, only starfish. I do everything and anything to make her feel wanted.

"I was just curious what your feelings are on long-term outcomes for depression. A little background for me: I have been on and off medicines for several years. I was always depressed as a child, but did not really seek professional help until maybe 10 years ago. I originally went on medicines. for severe pms prescribed to me by my ob-gyn. I just kind of continued on with it because it made me feel ""leveled out"". Then I had issues with sleep apnea, joint pains etc. My neurologist put me on Effexor. Every time I tried to go off that drug I was dizzy and had bad side effects. Finally, I reduced the dose myself and weaned myself off the Effexor. I had gained a tremendous amount of weight. I was off all medicines for 8 months and then I really feel into a dark depression. It was then that I sought a therapist, etc. I have been on medicines ever since..since June of 2004. I had lost 40 pounds by going off the medicines, but then became depressed again. following several deaths and major life events. I was put on Lexapro and gained weight. Not wanting to gain weight again, I hated being on the medicines. He kept saying it will stabilize. I told him that the weight gain was making me more depressed. Finally, he changed my medicines to Wellbutrin. We talked about trying to go off medicines when life events settled down..my main reason to go off was the weight gain. Immediately the weight came back off. That was a year ago. Now a year later, I am still losing about a pound or two a month. The last time I went in, he did not say anything about going off the medicines. How long do people take medicines? Is it just better to stay on them and not fall back into the hole? Are there any long-term use side effects to be concerned with? Is this something I will probably be on forever? It just seems like I will always be like this. It just seems like depression is always just standing back in the shadows. I go for a very long time and feel fine and then I have a week where I get very down and know that if I was not on medicines. it would be very bad. I have not gone to talk to my therapist in a long while. When I am having these bouts of depression, should I call and say I need to go in for a ""check-up"". I do not really have any specific issues to discuss. The big thing right now is I just feel down because I have lost my closest friends and do not feel like I have any friends to do anything with. I feel so isolated. Would it be good to just call and go in? I just feel stupid saying I feel sad because I do not have any friends. Are there any good books that you can recommend on self-help--esp. negative thinking, understanding why I think the way I do, etc. I found Dr. Phil is book on Life Strategies to be very helpful in discovering that there are reasons why I do things and think.","I was just curious what your feelings are on long-term outcomes for depression.

"My hearing, attentiveness and social awareness has been completely off since dropping into a very low depressive period as of late. Normal? Walking through a busy shopping center today and I feel heavy and zoned out. I ordered food at a bakery and could barely hear my voice as I spoke. I did not hear the employee very well and unknown to me like 8 high school kids entered as I was browsing and I did not even notice until I visually saw them. The sunlight drains me quick. And when crossing a street I often triple take even when absolutely nothing is coming. Fuck this.",I ordered food at a bakery and could barely hear my voice as I spoke.
"Hello out there.. Ugh. I battle with depression, anxiety, bulimia, OCPD, BPD, and some physical health issues. Not so sure about battle right now. Maybe more like grudgingly coexist with? I am 42. I have never held a job with the same company for longer than 3 years, and that was just once. A few times (I think) I have made it to the 2 year mark with a company. 1 year is a bit easier. I had to quit my last job because it was too easy to use the job to fuel the eating disorder. (I lost 40% of my starting weight in about 7 months, before I switched phases and ended up with a pulmonary embolism from refeeding syndrome.) Right now I am in the initial hurry up and deny me so I can get an attorney phase of applying for disability. Thankfully I have a sister who is letting me live in her house, so at least I am not homeless. (TBH, most of the time she is out of the country, and when she is here, she is just as selectively social as I am.) Because of waiting to get on disability, I am off my medicine. I cannot even afford the cheapest ACA insurance, and even if I had that, I could not afford the copays for my medicine. I am not eligible for Medicaid in my state until I get approved for SSI/SSDI. I am not too worried about not having my antidepressants right now tho. This is probably the most pleasant major depressive episode I have ever had. It is not so much feeling horrible psychic pain as it is just been a gentle bleeding out of the vibrancy of life. I sleep as late as I can every day, (usually until around 1 or so), hang out in bed playing games, reading, or watching videos, and only really waking up and being willing to be awake around 7 in the evening. I do not feel like I am living anymore. I am just in a holding pattern. I think back to what my life was like, even 8 months ago, and I mourn for it. At least I am not suicidal. I think I just need a place where I can come every so often and unload my mind.

Currently waiting at the hospital to be seen If I do not get treatment I am going to kill myself. No one in my daily life cares. My sister and my mom did not give a shit.

I was pretty heavily involved in music and martial arts for years, but I am no longer motivated to do either. I am still going to school, though I have no real direction and I am afraid that my lack of motivation is going to cause me to screw that up too. I started having anxiety attacks about a year ago and they have increased in frequency the last few months. They are (not to sound melodramatic) the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with. If I am in panic-attack mode, any slight pain or discomfort quickly becomes a life-threatening illness that is surely going to kill me in the next few minutes. As ridiculous as that sounds, it is absolutely real when it is happening and I live in almost constant fear it is going to happen again. I have a hard time even driving anymore (especially on the freeway) and increasingly rely on my girlfriend for menial things like going to the store. She is very supportive and is aware that something is wrong, though I do not think she understands to what extent. I have started completely avoiding any situation in which I have to meet new people and have a hard time even talking to people I do not know on the phone. These symptoms have been increasing in intensity over the last 6 months or so and exponentially for the last 3 weeks (I just lost my job). It seems like quite a few of you have been dealing with these sorts of things for much longer and I am sorry if my posting here so soon seems insensitive, but its already getting to the point where I know I cannot handle living like this for years on end. I have suffered from depression for (relative to my age) a long time and the anxiety attacks are absolutely terrifying (a little redundant, I know). It feels like the last year is the beginning of everything completely falling apart. I guess my posting here is a way to get the ball rolling towards getting some help. I do not have health insurance anymore and I am not sure where to go from here. I have been medicated in the past, but I have not taken anything in a few years. Though, without insurance I am not even sure that is an option. That is enough for now. Thanks for providing a resource like this.

"An Open Letter Dear you, It is been three years since we decided to go our separate ways. We both had different goals, desires and aspirations. We were perfect together, but just at the wrong time.

I am sorry I did not have the experience or the know-how to react to certain situations. I am sorry that I made mountains out of molehills.

I went to Italy - twice. I have been to Times Square at midnight, and so have you. I did it all, but by myself. It is not what I wanted. It is not what I envisioned. You cannot just replace somebody special with another person, and that you were. Special. It is been three years. Despite some triumphs and successes, it still feels like I lost a war. An immense failure that did not personify my persona, it personified myself. On the surface, I am told I seem ambitious, fully ready to attack each day. On the inside, I feel defeated. In the end, you found somebody new, which is fine. I chose, whether consciously or unconsciously to stay on a different path. I have tried new women. Many beautiful on the outside, but they are not you. Oh no, no, no. They all do not have what you had. Not even close. Maybe one day I will end this crusade against myself, against the past. I cannot change it, I cannot alter the story, I cannot lie to myself. I wish I could tell you I am sorry. But it would not change anything. For you it is a battle that was fought long ago. For me, I relive it more times than I would care to admit. I am emotionally crippled, distraught, defeated. It is been a long three years. I am ready for it to be over. I am sorry. Yours truly, Me.","I am sorry things ended badly.

"I just really need to vent.. For a start, I understand everyone in life are at different levels and that depression and anxiety is different for everyone and I am in no way stating who has it worst or better. I have taken hours and hours of training in it and I am not here to speak or preach about how to help.. In a rare occasion in my life I am asking for help, guidance, I do not know the correct word but maybe if I explain myself a bit it may help. This maybe long and I do apologize but I just need to say all of this SOMEWHERE.. I am gay guy that recently moved from a conservative town in Montana to the amazing city of Portland, OR. I came out of the closet the summer going into my freshman year of high school, dealt with a (simply put) shitty childhood while growing up in the Bible Belt of northern Florida, with an abusive father and worrying, even at the age of 7/8 about how my future would play out in this. My mom divorced and remarried a man that does not accept my sexuality personally but supports my life decision and says he loves me. We moved to Montana (my mom, me and him) and I began to feel like I did have a purpose when I was introduced to acting onstage at a local theatre that I fell in love with. Life, for a few years, was amazing but my high school at the time was having a crisis. Unfortunately four students had committed suicide between my freshman and junior year and, with the help of many, started a suicide awareness program in the city and lead that for a year or so. My senior year, literally three days before it started, my military brother committed suicide on base, it was suspected it was also his sexuality. But also in my senior year, near the end of it, I met a man whom I fell in love with (which is what I am getting too, just bare with me). We were able to spend a lot of time together for a month or two before he had to leave to Portland (before I had gone) for a work internship where he would go back home to Brazil once completed. He treats me like gold, and I really mean that, he has been nothing but amazing to me. He flew me out to Portland so I could visit him for two weeks where we fell even more in love. Everything was shattered when he left for home and I also left for an adventure. After I graduated, I had the amazing opportunity to go to the BEAUTIFUL island of Taiwan, where I spent an amazing year learning Chinese (Mandarin), meeting people all around the world, experiencing a new culture for the first time, it was indeed a life changing time for me. But it was not easy for my boyfriend and I. We fought in occasion, texting makes it really hard to communicate emotions, and we only had about two hours out of our days to talk due to the harsh time zone differences. The year went by quite quickly and he surprised me with yet another plane ticket to Portland where he would also land only two hours after I did and we would be together again. It was only for two weeks again but I felt complete.. He even proposed on the Fourth of July. He was yanked away from me again soon after and it tore me down. My heart crumbled. My next chapter in life had started once I arrived back from Taiwan and had seen my boyfriend again. I had decided I wanted to move to a Portland permanently, found a decent student housing apartment, enrolled for school, I was excited.. now this is where things become a bit much for me and why I am here today. My, now fianc, was able to stay with me for a full month this time. Now at this point I am sure you wonder (if you are still reading), why does not he move here?, or why do not you move there? Here is why: He was on an exchange program when I met him that the Brazilian government paid for. The requirement for that visa is that he must stay in Brazil for two years before he can legally move back into the USA. In other words, he is stuck there while I am stuck here both separated and both in fear of him being rejected. We applied for the fianc visa and now we are waiting for the approval. I refuse to move where he lives because of how high the crime rate is and due to Brazil is economic status, we both agreed it would not be good for a white American target to live in a high crime area. I know I have talked a lot about my fianc but here is also what is going on on my hands as well that I just was not ready for. Before I moved to Portland, I had to go to urgent care because I had no primary doctor and no money, only Medicaid, which they took. I went three times for small bumps on my hands that turned out to be stressed induced and all three times I went the doctors said I have no idea! Try using lotions and see what happens! Nodded their heads and left. Very pointless but when I got the bill I was shocked and confused. I thought my Medicaid had covered it, which it did not because while I was out of country my Medicaid had expired and no one told me about it, therefore I was left with a $600 bill. I heard it off for a while because I had other things to deal with than the bullshit that the hospital was giving me about it. Around this time as well, I moved in with my best friend due to a dispute I had with my parents, which really crumbled me, but they still do not know how upset I am about it. I moved to Portland.. and now I believe I am regretting it.. I moved with that same best friend where we would also share the space with two others, a couple from Hawaii. We had Skyped then ahead of time in our excitement of moving and we were all excited to meet each other. I had a job lined up for me as a barista, I had a savings plan lined up for what I could and could not spend for money, school would be starting soon, things were looking pretty nice! Well.. it is not nice. Not nice at all. The Hawaiian couple does not like my friend and I. They stop our oven mittens and tried to say they were there is and hid them from us, refused to let us use the garbage can in the kitchen, and held little meetings about what it is we were doing wrong and how we could fix it.. I was so thrown back I ignore them at any chance and even had to take time out of my life to tell them how upsetting it is we had reached a level where they had to actually put sticky notes on things we could touch and could not touch. I find myself to be quite tidy and clean and fair but I guess there are two sides of the story always. That is the first thing. That job I had lined up as a barista? Big joke.. I met with the boss who said the store is not open yet and asked if I wanted to be a cashier for the university instead. I said why not, the pay was amazing at $12.75 an hour and had benefits. I did my on-boarding and was quite interested. First day on the job however they lied and put me in food service where I was demanded around by two chefs and four managers who did not know what the fuck they were doing. One of the chef is actually spilt boiling grease on my foot and did not even apologize. The other chef was racist and talked bad about the Indian workers so much I had to leave his presence. It was a toxic environment. Income tax in Oregon was so high I was not able to afford my apartment and realized I need to be working minimum wage to sincerely support myself here. I left after a month and am now struggling on finding a full time again. On a side note, because of costs and issues with finding a co-signed for a loan, I had to pull my enrollment for school as well. That is the second.. When my fianc came to visit me for a month, my best friend/roommate was very difficult.. it is a harsh word to use but she has a lot of learning to do. I have been on my own since I was 16 in doing things myself (with the exception of paying my phone bill and buying a car). Taxes, jobs, appointments, etc., were all me. She needs some help getting there and she has done and amazing job to get there but.. every opportunity I hand her to take one more step of becoming independent she rejects and shuts down completely. The whole month was very hard for my fianc and I over how jealous and upset she got and it was too much. Currently she is back home for Christmas and I am alone and quite frankly I needed it. I just do not know how to handle that situation. It was as if she was using her emotions against me and it was poisonous. It go so bad my fianc and Igor an Airbnb our last two nights together so it could just be me and him. That is the third.. I had to go to the emergency room as well when my fianc was here due to yet another kidney stone. I got one in the 7th grade, near the end of my exchange program and one in a restaurant where the pain was so bad I needed to call an ambulance.. more money on shit I cannot afford. I can go on and on with these stories but I need to get to this.. it is my anxiety. I was diagnosed with depression in high school but was taken off of medication. I was doing actually quite well! But most recently, with everything that is been going on, it is gotten really really bad. I am constantly anxed about everything.. when I walk down the street, I fear what people look at me as. Now I am not fat, I would say I am average but my cheeks are so puffy and it really embarrasses me to even look in a mirror. I am constantly wondering why my fianc wants to be with me, if he is cheating on me, lied to me, etc. I over stress about the smallest smallest things. Example: I cried and broke down because I failed my drivers test for the Oregon license. I physically felt like I was going to die or the end of the world was happening.. why? Why was that happening to me? Why is this ALL happening to me? I miss my fianc, I cannot get stable, I now starting out as an adult is not supposed to be easy but guys.. this is really hard. I spend any day I have off in bed and I have only had one meal within two days. I know I need help but I do not have the money for it or the time. I have never felt this insecure about my life, future, body, everything. I feel like I am climbing up an escalator that is going the wrong way, and no amount of running will get me to the top. I do not know where else to go or who to talk to. I feel like I have annoyed everyone already enough about me that I no longer want to talk to literally anyone. My fianc sometimes even. Well if you have made it this far I thank you sincerely.. I just really needed to vent.","In a rare occasion in my life I am asking for help, guidance, I do not know the correct word but maybe if I explain myself a bit it may help.
I am gay guy that recently moved from a conservative town in Montana to the amazing city of Portland, OR.
Life, for a few years, was amazing but my high school at the time was having a crisis.
We were able to spend a lot of time together for a month or two before he had to leave to Portland (before I had gone) for a work internship where he would go back home to Brazil once completed.
After I graduated, I had the amazing opportunity to go to the BEAUTIFUL island of Taiwan, where I spent an amazing year learning Chinese (Mandarin), meeting people all around the world, experiencing a new culture for the first time, it was indeed a life changing time for me.
We fought in occasion, texting makes it really hard to communicate emotions, and we only had about two hours out of our days to talk due to the harsh time zone differences.
My, now fianc, was able to stay with me for a full month this time.
I know I have talked a lot about my fianc but here is also what is going on on my hands as well that I just was not ready for.
Around this time as well, I moved in with my best friend due to a dispute I had with my parents, which really crumbled me, but they still do not know how upset I am about it.
I had a job lined up for me as a barista, I had a savings plan lined up for what I could and could not spend for money, school would be starting soon, things were looking pretty nice!
I was so thrown back I ignore them at any chance and even had to take time out of my life to tell them how upsetting it is we had reached a level where they had to actually put sticky notes on things we could touch and could not touch.
Income tax in Oregon was so high I was not able to afford my apartment and realized I need to be working minimum wage to sincerely support myself here.
I left after a month and am now struggling on finding a full time again.
When my fianc came to visit me for a month, my best friend/roommate was very difficult..
She needs some help getting there and she has done and amazing job to get there but..
The whole month was very hard for my fianc and I over how jealous and upset she got and it was too much.
I got one in the 7th grade, near the end of my exchange program and one in a restaurant where the pain was so bad I needed to call an ambulance..
I am constantly wondering why my fianc wants to be with me, if he is cheating on me, lied to me, etc.
I physically felt like I was going to die or the end of the world was happening..
I know I need help but I do not have the money for it or the time.
My fianc sometimes even."
"Mum is questions are relentless My mum is always asking me 'How is blahblah from high school?' 'Are you meeting up with blahblahblah this winter?' 'Have you spoken to blahblooh?' No mum. None of them want to know me. They ignore me, do not reply to my messages and do not want to meet up. It is embarrassing having to explain it all the time.",-
"Being an adult fucking blows, working a shit job that keeps me poor making me want to just jump in front of a bus Seriously struggling to see why I would want to engage in living when it is so menial and relatively pointless. Ca not see any friends as I live so far away and my family simply do not know how to support me. Working at a shit paying job with zero prospects and massive student debt, how can I possibly look forward to anything in the future when the present is always painful. Mental illness is just poisoning every aspect of my world and I cannot be fucked to fight it i just wish I could live more on my own terms but apparently that is selfish and naive",-
"My dad died today So I am 16, coming on 17 next month. Today my dad died at 42. He has not been doing so well for a few days. Yesterday his legs gave out and he was stuck on the bed with his lungs in pain if he lay on his back. For 24 hours, no sleep, food, or drink. Many more problems that I cannot remember, and he is been feeling like shit emotionally too due to family issues. My mom went to check in on him before going to the store. Since yesterday she is been trying to get him to go to the hospital but of course he is stubborn. When she came back from the store, she decided she would have the ambulance come and pick him up because he REALLY needed to go in. Slurring his words, despite actually being sober in the mornings. When she went back to get his consent over phone to get picked up for the ambulance, he was out cold already. Lips purple, cold, lifeless. It had been only 30-40 minutes since she last saw him, alive, or whatever was left of his life. I was there to see a fresh dead corpse. My dad. My *dad.* To say my world is crashing around me is an understatement. I am just a fucking kid, going through my own battles with myself and now my dad is just *gone.* I did not have the best relationship with him but he was a really, really good guy and this stings like a bitch. All of it feels unreal and at the same time scarily real. Everything is numb. I am lost.","My dad died today So I am 16, coming on 17 next month.

"""You do not have it bad enough""/""You only think about yourself"" Got into a discussion with my SO because of my depression/anxiety. They told me I do not have it bad enough and if I were worse off I would get my shit together. So something in me snaps and I admit I would actually rather be dead (whoops). This leads to them telling me I am only thinking about myself and asking me how I believe they feel when I tell them I want to die. Anyone else got to hear stuff like this?","""You do not have it bad enough""/""You only think about yourself"" Got into a discussion with my SO because of my depression/anxiety."
I am lost hahaha I do not even know why I posted this. I broke up with my gf today. I thought I was happy about it. I think is the right choice. A month of cutting and self hate is enough. But now I still feel it.. And I want to cut again.,A month of cutting and self hate is enough.
"I have no friends This is not an over dramatic statement. I truly have no friends. Throughout the years I have grown a part from people and I have distanced myself from people I felt were toxic. I have had my heart broken by a few friends. But right now I am sitting here looking at this funny meme I wanted to share and I realized I have no one to send it to. I hope all of this makes sense one day. Goodnight Edit: Wow, I did not expect this response! It is comforting to know I am not alone. We are all in this together &amp; I feel happy to know I am a part of a sub with so many caring, kind people. If any of you need a friend or just need someone to talk to, I am here.

"Constant battle between ambition and not wanting to live. Since I was about 12 I have had recurring suicidal thoughts. The thing is, I do not have low self esteem or anything of that sort, it is actually quite the opposite and I always joke about being a narcissist. I may not be an actual narcissist, but I have always had a slight superiority complex. I do not hate myself, but I just hate my life and the continuous chore known as living. On the outside, I have always been the life of the party, but deep down I do not ever remember being happy. As someone who is highly ambitious, it feels as if there is a never ending struggle between wanting to be successful enough to be well known or have an impact on the world, and wanting to stop existing. Yet with the prospect of the latter, comes the failure of the former. I know that if I lowered my expectations in life I would be mildly happier, yet the thought of settling for mediocrity gives me horrible anxiety and fills me with dread. Recently things have gotten worse due to my university workload. I have been having trouble completing assignment and functioning in general. I have considered getting help but I feel deeply uncomfortable at the thought of opening up to someone, since I am not a very emotional person. I have come to accept that I will probably never be happy. I have always wondered if I would be more likely to actually commit suicide if I ever attained the level of success I desire since I would have then achieved my goal in life, or if that would finally bring me the contentment I seek. I suppose it would be the former since I can never be content.","The thing is, I do not have low self esteem or anything of that sort, it is actually quite the opposite and I always joke about being a narcissist.

"I am not sad. I am not sad, but I am lost and have no motivation in doing anything. It is hurting my school work, and I am losing my grades. The only thing I want to do is play video games all day. I do not know where to go, I am just lost. I have asked my parents for help at extreme lows, but they think I am faking and their insurance is awful. I do not know anymore.","I am not sad, but I am lost and have no motivation in doing anything."
"Unstuck yourself I used to be stuck in negative mood and had suicide plan at one point. I did not see the point of doing anything nor meaning of life itself. One day a light bulb went off. I realize the world is much bigger than any of us could see or imagine from our corner at a given time. We should not refuse to do things just because we do not understand the point. Instead we should celebrate the gift we are given. Just go do things because we CAN! If you are lonely, go talk to a homeless person. You will be surprised how much you could learn. If someone did you wrong at one time, forgive them and live for the future. Life has so much for us to explore. The trick is to start on one thing. Put left foot before right foot, then next .. You will feel better soon once you stop feeling by start doing.","I realize the world is much bigger than any of us could see or imagine from our corner at a given time.

"I am so fucking lonely.. My husband is my best friend. Hes my dude. And when hes busy I have friends to fall back on as well. Recently the whole family got back to back sickness and we were basically quarantined for two weeks just bumming around trying to get better. So I let my kid watch too much tv, let my husband play all the video games, so i could do my stuff with out being bothered as well. Let me also say, I didnt plant my kid in front of the tv for hours on end, but I have to shower, and keep up with the house because man colds are much more sever (no..). Now that were better his behaviors have continued, even though i have spoke to him many times; things wont be like this when were not longer sick. My kid is not a tv kid and I plan to keep it that way as long as I can.. but he.. he does not want to spend time with me any more, just step away from electronics and just chill and talk and play with our kid together.. so I wanted to talk to my friends or even my mom.. and I realized I do not have very many friends.

"I feel like I am a terrible person for being sad My life is going fine: I have solid grades, I hardly have to study, and I am financially stable. However, even though everything is going great I am still sad every day, and spend a lot of time thinking about how to kill myself. No one notices that I am sad, and everyone thinks I must be really happy about how everything is going, and it just makes me feel worse that I cannot be happy even when I have everything: every victory is hollow and ever action feels pointless. I do not even know who to talk to about this because I do not want to bother anyone, people have enough to worry about without me involving them in my problems, especially small ones like my feelings.",-
"I am Ugly and it is killing me I am quite young, still a teen. But I am ugly as fuck. Even my best friends call me ugly. Even some people that I barely know have called me ugly in the past. And I am not fat/out of shape. It is all in my genes. I am aware that looks are not everything but lets be real here; they matter a lot more than we would like to admit. Not only when it comes to dating but also friendships as well as many other things. We prefer attractive people over unattractive ones no matter the context. My parents are not ugly, my sister is not ugly, I have no idea why I am as ugly as I am. It kills me to think about what others think about my looks.

"A letter to my sister, who has conquered her depression The letter you always wanted to write.. Family stuff happened and those wounds in you festered and festered. No one knew at the beginning. You hid it well under your sleeves and at the back of your eyes. Before it all happened, I sometimes looked at you and thought that this would happen to you. It is the way you used to hold your emotion. It is as if you were full to the brim with it, but you forced it down, shoved it into a box and hid it away. It was strange, but I was too young to understand. And then, slowly but surely, it took you over. You were so young. In my worst nightmares I imagined finding your lifeless body. I could not wake you up. You would not wake up. My darling sister, even now I still imagine your cold body. How can such a deathly and frightening disease exist? You wasted away. Your cheeks were concave, and you did not even have to bend over for every bone of your spine to be visible. Your sharp wit and intelligent mind dulled. Your eyes were dark holes in your face. They were so empty. You slept all afternoon and night. I would lay my cardigan over you so you would not get cold. But I do not think it made a difference. You were lost to us, floating in some different universe with no anchor or thread holding you to us. And then you tried to end it all. Multiple times. When I think about it, I blame you sometimes. But I know that the blame is not really towards you. It is towards me, of course. I am your sister. I should have been your protector. Is it OK if I say that I could not really do anything but stand there and watch it run its course? Or is that just an excuse? You are my best friend, even though I am not always yours. I wish I would be kinder to you, but I probably will always hold some of myself away. Maybe I am punishing myself. I do not know. No one can say it did not take a toll on all of us. You probably do not remember, but we were going to the corner shop together once. As we chatted, you were vehement that you were a failure. I asked you, what on earth were you a failure at? What life had you lived that you possibly could have failed? And you said: I failed at life. So what was the alternative, my dear? Death? I am telling you, I lived those few years in the fear that you would be taken away from us by your own hand. Even as I am writing this, I do not know where to start or end. In my mind, it is such a mess. It does not matter because you are well now. I have never seen someone work harder. You are radiant and beautiful and clever and sarcastic and so special I could not tell you how much if I tried. I hope you will always appreciate the battles you have fought and won. I hope you always believe you are a success. I wish you all the happiness you deserve. Love you, babe. Your sister","You hid it well under your sleeves and at the back of your eyes.

"How to avoid a relapse? I have been having a particularly rough year; I attempted suicide, the love of my life left me, I failed my year at university, I have been physically assaulted, I have been sexually assaulted and today my grandfather died. I feel like I am running on empty and doing the bare minimum to survive for myself while trying to be a rock to others. My emotional resilience has been wiped out.

"Falling back into it I am 16, and this weekend, I got into a big argument with my girlfriend of 7 months. We had not seen each other in 2 weeks, and our plans to see each other fell through. I tried to save our plans, but she seemed disinterested. I was so distraught and caught up in sadness and self-hatred that I, wanting to distance myself from the situation, not just leaving it alone, told her I wanted to break up with her out of sheer emotional irrationality. It turns out I was sadder without her, and she reached out to me to talk soon later. We got back together, and she said she was okay. The way she described the whole situation let me know she understood my plight completely, but I ruined her that day and she is been off ever since. She painted her nails black, screamed at her parents, texted all her friends to tell them how much of a terrible person I was, wrote ""Anon is a piece of shit cunt"" in her bathroom mirror in sharpie, and cried all day from the story she told. I have fallen into a depression of guilt to a magnitude that I have not experienced since I was a self-loathing near-friendless 7th grader with pent up emotions drowning it all out with video games while tanking his grades, watching the few distant friends get reward after reward, trophy after trophy. I feel like I am a piece of shit that does not deserve to breathe the air on this earth, and I do not know what to do. My parents are very unsympathetic and judgmental and my brother is borderline abusive. My girlfriend is the only one left who understands me. At this point, it is just me who has the problem, as she is gotten over the whole debacle, or so she says. Her mom even said ""ehh, you two were just stressed out teenagers"", but I am still not convinced. I feel like there is something deeply wrong with me. Is there any advice or words of wisdom that I need to hear? I want to get back to normal. I do not know how I will deal with feeling completely alone again and losing the people close to me emotionally.","Falling back into it I am 16, and this weekend, I got into a big argument with my girlfriend of 7 months.

do people ever find their jobs interesting? you have gone to school and studied and worked hard to get the job you have alway wanted.. is it as interesting as you hoped it would be before you got the job? or was it just a waste of time? cause all i see online are people complaining that your dream job is not really what it seems and i wanted to know if life is just gonna keep getting more depressing even if you get your dream job,do people ever find their jobs interesting?

There is a concert I want to go to so bad, but cant because of that. And I am really sad because all these years I tried being friends with people completely different, and all it did was make me more depressed and feel like I was a mistake. Clubs are 18+ too.

"I am losing the girl I have been with for 7 years and it is because of my drug use, really bummed I have been with this girl since 9th grade I am now 23 and I can honestly say I love her with my whole heart. I have been abusing drugs of all variety since I was 15, herion, meth, pills, uppers, downers, alcohol, marijuana, research chemicals, it does not matter, but I prefer if it fits into a syringe. I have been to rehab 9 times since I was 15 I would get sober then relapse sober then relapse sober etc.. I have had legal trouble and been in and out of jail she has been with me through it all, she has always been my better half. No words can explain how blessed I have been to have her. This past relapse I was clean for two years before hand and our relationship had never been better we were both happy we both trusted and we both loved no matter what. She helped me get my g.e.d. And she helped me through my grandfathers death (he raised me). I had subtle depression over it I felt like that was normal losing a loved one and all, but I eventually stopped doing the things I was susposed to to maintain my sobriety, I felt like I was cured and no longer needed all the recovery stuff. I was wrong. So one day I decided to take some benzodiazepines and that made me go straight to crystal meth in the time frame of a week I was back shooting meth spending all of my money on it and staying up for days. When on meth I have serious delusions I accused her of cheating on me I actually believed these delusions with my whole heart I felt so betrayed and hurt, I wanted to die. What I feel like really did it was I accused her of cheating on Facebook. Even after multiple people telling me I was wrong I could not believe it, I just KNEW everybody was out to get me especially her, I was very unfair and called her names and called her at all hours of the night, completely out of character of me. After being the good loving boyfriend she knows and loves for two years I suddenly became a monster. I totaled the vehicle I owned and went to jail for possession with intent (Benzodiazepines) possession of marijuana and dui. I sat there for two months (thank god) while I was in there she told me she just could not do this with me anymore and told me she has somebody else in her life, this crushed me. I contemplated suicide while I was in there fought anybody that even remotely rubbed me the wrong way and lost my appetite could not sleep. So I get out and I know that I should just stay away from her because I love her and I do not want to hinder her pursuing something else, I respected her decision to move on, after all I did publicly humiliate her. So right now I have been sober a month and I feel good in a clear minded healthy way, but I have this hole where she used to be I find myself riding around for hours thinking and crying. I am very upset that I let this happen, currently I just cannot keep my mind off of her I just want our love and friendship back. I am very depressed and lately I have thought about using again but I would rather kill myself before I do that, I cannot get high anymore I would honestly rather be dead. I am going to NA meetings, going to church, praying all day, but I cannot seem to ever feel better about losing her no matter what positive things I do. I would rather be dead then to live without her and I do not know what else to do.","I am losing the girl I have been with for 7 years and it is because of my drug use, really bummed I have been with this girl since 9th grade I am now 23 and I can honestly say I love her with my whole heart.

"I do not know what it is like to be not depressed. Hi my name is ahmulz and I am depressed. Been depressed arguably since I was 15 (25 now). Looking back on my childhood, I can definitely see some signs of childhood depression. The past year has been particularly bad in terms of my mental health. I am better than I was a year ago. I have joined a gym. I do pole dancing. I got a cat. I have a therapist. I am medicated. I volunteer more. I see occasional good things in myself. I am not actively suicidal anymore. Yet..

I still have more work to do to ""fix myself"" (fucking diet, fucking exercise, bullshit mindfulness) but it all just feels like so much goddamn work at the end of the day. I do not know what I am working towards. I cannot comprehend a world in which I do not wake up in an apartment that needs to be cleaned because I am too tired and too lazy to do it or that I do not spend my time in a numb, self-loathing void. I do not know how people get through their days liking themselves or liking their life. It is frustrating and lonely.

"I have dealt with panic / anxiety / depression / ptsd for some time now. I was in a 14 year abusive marriage and it has been two years since I left that marriage. This past August was one year since my divorce was final. I have two children, both boys, 6 and 10. My ten year old has ADHD and depression. I worry constantly for my kids because of what they saw during our marriage. There are so many times I get so overwhelmed and just need to be around people who just ""get it."" When I left, I brought my kids and myself home to my parents. I have been with them since. My mother, does not ""get it."" She thinks that just because I left the marriage, I should be okay by now. Well I guess 14 years may take a little longer than 2 years to fix. I used to come here a long time ago. I am glad I came back. I have seen so many familiar faces already and met new ones as well. I just want a place where I feel I belong. A place where I can go when I just need someone to be there. It is been a long road, with many twists and turns ..

"I have no idea what to do My husband and I got into an argument last night that has lasted until this morning. Through out the entire argument, he has called me horrible names and hurt me deep. I thought i was almost over my depression, I thought i was getting better, but the things he has said has taken me from where I thought I was all the way back down to extremely emotional and having suicidal thoughts. The argument started because I was talking too loudly to his son while trying to correct his behaviour. I am 38 weeks pregnant, and lately have been easily annoyed and upset by the boy not listening to me. My husband called me a bunch of hurtful things because I tried to explain why I was so upset. Later on in the night he told me my mom and oldest sister were no longer allowed to visit me for the birth of our child. Then he spent several more hours talking about how they were ""rot gut whores"" and how he does not want them around HIS son all because 2 years ago my sister invited me to a christmas dinner she knew I wasnt going to show up for and did not specifically include my husband in the invitation. Yet his mom is coming a few weeks after, and she had left him and his brother to fend for themselves in a trailer in the middle of a forest only showing up to bring them food when they called her and begged her for it. But because she ""has not done anything to offend"" me, he is totally ok with her showing up. Now he is talking about how if I want my mom to be here so bad, I can leave with her when she visits. And I have fully expressed how depressed I am to him and he is not even worried in the slightest. He just keeps refering to my past as a teen who would sleep with practically anyone to try to get some sort of pleasure out of life, saying he bets I want to go back to that, that i would treat his son better if he were black, and that i would try harder to not upset my husband if he were black. Part of me hopes something goes REALLY wrong in the birthing process and that I will die or be put in a coma from it. I have never felt so useless, stranded, and alone in my entire life.","My husband called me a bunch of hurtful things because I tried to explain why I was so upset.
Then he spent several more hours talking about how they were ""rot gut whores"" and how he does not want them around HIS son all because 2 years ago my sister invited me to a christmas dinner she knew I wasnt going to show up for and did not specifically include my husband in the invitation.

"My depression is so strong that I cannot even enjoy music! Music has been my favorite pass time for a year or so. It really helps with my depression and anxiety.

"I just need my spirit to settle In its totality it does not have to be about wins and loses, or what I failed to do. Neither does it have to be about my past years and the thoughts that come with immense feelings that appears to haunt me.

I am not living to grow or to become strong after a catastrophic situation. I am looking for my spirit to simply just settle. I am not seeking any advice nor trying to raise my fist towards challenges. I am not seeking any of that just a settling of the inner me. To me, that is important than anything else because I would gladly be able to live with that when I one day be out of this earth. I am not the goal oriented type. Its not about climbing this ladder of life. I am not here for any of what most people are striving for. I seek for my spirit to settle for all these years. That is what I am chasing. Most people are chasing dreams, families, success, marriages, money, respect, and fame, but not this human. More power to them and I am sure they will obtain all those things but I for one am not seeking to obtain. The human game is a serious thing filled with losses and wins. I do not wanna count anymore nor try to get to the next level of life. Cycling through the infinite regrets and regression. The only goal is for this spirit to settle some type of way. I am gunning for an internal calmness. Something that can penetrate and flood the mind of mine. Something that can provide some internal at ease like affect for myself. So I say to my spirit, I hope you settle.","I just need my spirit to settle In its totality it does not have to be about wins and loses, or what I failed to do.

"Torn. Need advice.. Hey Reddit. I am not sure how to start all this but im going to explain to my best ability. Here goes. So, i have i had depression and anxiety give or take 3 years. I recently opened up about it to my girlfriend and she encouraged me to open up about it to my mother. I told her about almost everything. The one thing i did not mention to her was the.. suicidal thoughts. Now, for our family feelings isnt our thing. We keep everything closed up and then repress it all. Thats what i have been doing for years not just with depression but everything. Now, these past three days have been brutal on me. I had no want to leave my bed or eat or even sleep. I just lay there and listen to music. I have been having suicial thoughts here and there these past three days. I will have happy moments here and there. But it doesnt last (shocker) and i just go back to feeling like pure awfulness. So, I am a 17 y/o male and I start senior year in August. We are a military family. My dream is the military. Thats all i have ever wanted. I want to follow my brothers footsteps because he is a total badass. All ive ever talked about to people, when they ask me what i want, to do is how badly i want to join the military. I do not think, with my current mental state, that i should go to the military. But i also fully believe that if i dont go i will disappoint everyone around me and they will be disgusted in me and i also believe that i will fall deeper into this dark hole i have been in. I have come to ask you guys, Any ideas on what to do? I am taking a cross country trip in 2 weeks with my brother and I will ask him some things about this and hopefully it will clear my head. Thank you for reading. I forgot to mention. I want to go get help. get put on medication. But the military doesnt accept people who are on anti depressants.

"I know this might not fall under ""depression"", but it strongly relates to my depression. Example: Today I ran into a kid Brendon from my school and he said hi and started to talk to me. I went on with the conversation, but felt so uncomfortable. I know him and all, but after the conversation, I find myself saying ""Wow..that was awful..I suck at life."" I hate myself and I always think that everyone is laughing at me. Even when two people are laughing I always think that they are laughing at me.

"Does anyone else get very angry at just stupid little things? It seems like over the last few months everyone around me is getting all they want out of life, and I am suffering with depression. Which, of course, makes me feel worse and then I feel guilty for not being happy for them. BUT, I also get angry when they ""flaunt"" their happiness around me. My roommate just started seeing someone she met off eharmony. We both signed up at the same time for fun, and while I was rejected time and time again, she was SO picky and then started seeing the first guy she went out with. I am happy that she found someone and she really deserves it, but I get so ANGRY that she is constantly doing things with him. It is like I have been replaced. I feel like a 5 year old for thinking that, but I just cannot help how I feel. Today, for example, I asked her if she wanted to watch a movie I had gotten off our digital cable. We have it until 9 tonight and she said she would like to. I was pretty excited seeing as how I had not been invited to a couple of events this weekend in lieu of ZACH going. Well, she just came down stairs and said that Zach is going to be coming over now. This ticks me off because she broke our plans, and I do not have a way to ""escape"" when they are here. I am sure she is going to want to watch that movie with Zach, and, I know I am being selfish, but I do not WANT him here tonight. I have not gotten to see Angela all weekend and the one night we have before going back to work HE is going to be here. So I have to put on my happy face and pretend that I am glad for her and happy that she has someone and engage him in conversation when all I will feel like doing is crying. It is unfair! Why does it seem like when you are depressed, everyone around you has these GREAT things happening in their life. Angela just got a promotion, a new car, and now a new boyfriend. I am stuck in the same job, same crushing car payment, and I have not dated anyone in over 6 years.","We have it until 9 tonight and she said she would like to.

"this is my first post. I am 27, 5 and a half months pregnant dealing with depression / anxiety. I have taken antidepressants off and on for a few years but stopped this summer because my husband and I were trying to conceive. My pregnancy has been pretty rough this time around .. (I have an 8 year old son). I have had joint problems, severe morning sickness .. and terrible depression / anxiety. My husband just does not understand what I am going through .. he thinks that I am being hateful or sad on purpose. He contributes to a lot of the way that I feel. He told me early in the pregnancy, that if something was to happen and I lose the baby or it was born with something wrong with it, he would have a hard time not blaming me for it even if the doctor said that nothing could have prevented it. This was said to me because I was not taking my prenatal vitamins at the time because of the morning sickness. I could see if I were using drugs or drinking but I do not do those things. I do not understand his thinking on that subject. My mother in law is another person getting on my nerves. She comes over uninvited and gives out unwanted advice. She also has a way of making me angry with her thoughtless comments which are hurtful and unnecessary. I cannot talk to my husband about this because he would see me as the ""bad guy"". Sometimes I just want to be alone .. away from people .. I feel like I do not have any privacy anymore. My husband always makes me feel worse when I talk to him about how I feel. I do not know why he aggravates me to talk to him then always says .. ""Well, you ought to be thankful .. rrblah rrblah rrblah"". It is not like I do not know that I could have it worse .. but he never cares what I feel at that moment. I guess I better shut up ..

I am not ungrateful and I really do appreciate everything that I have in my life, but it is very hard for me to get out of bed in the morning and live out my day. One of my main problems is my weight. I know this may seem vain to some of you, but it is a huge problem for me, someone who already struggles with low self esteem. I have gained about 15 lbs in a year, and I cannot control what I eat, nor can I motivate myself to work out. I do not recognize myself anymore, none of my old clothes fit, and I cannot seem to be able to do anything about it. Every day, I tell myself, I will eat healthy, I will make better decisions, I will not hate myself, I will not speak down to myself, etc.. Each and every day, I fail. This kills me. My second problem is that I have a well paying job but it is very stressful and demanding. It takes up the majority of my day and this stress feeds into my poor eating habits. I have considered quitting but I cannot justify saying no to the money. I am scared that if I quit to try to focus on myself, I will just eat more and more because I will be less busy.

Surly attitude because you cannot wear your pretty sandals (unless you like blue toes) and your boyfriend is been lying to you for months about the upcoming lekker warm weather?

"Hi everyone! I have been trying to find something or someone to help me out depression for ages, but I am not an open person and it is been very difficult for me. I was never happy with my life and been just running away from problems. I left home when I was 18 and went to London.

"I have had a rough time of things lately, which is partly what made me search for this site. I have had recurrent unipolar depression since my mid teens with an associated anxiety disorder and a panic disorder that took root 5 years ago after I beat a drink problem I had at the time (between the age of 22 and 25 I used alcohol as a bit of a crutch which was a huge mistake). Anyway these days I am teetotal, on anti depressants and only really get a bad time with my depression A during the winter months or B if something triggers an episode (circumstantial). Usually it lifts up in the summer months (I think I might get a bit of SAD) but last year my mother passed away on the 23rd of March and it caused a huge crash in my mood which never lifted in time before the winter episode took hold. I dealt with it by comfort eating (I do comfort eat at times, but I also get bad food cravings in the winter for foods such as chocolate, cheese and carbohydrates, so pizza and chocolate ice-cream became my regular fodder for a while). Anyway that lead to weight gain which is besides the point but which I was planning on correcting (as I have done before) this summer when the food cravings wear off and my mood lifted. Unfortunately it is not lifted as of yet due to recent circumstances. Not only did I have the first anniversary of my mother is death to deal with, but my partner whom I loved very much decided that this would be the best time to dump me and completely rip me to shreds in the process. He basically emailed (he lives in another city) a few days before the anniversary of her death saying he wanted to end it. I tried to contact him but he would not talk on the telephone or by voice, and would not respond to any emails I sent him. He then contacted me by IM on the day of her anniversary (23rd March) to rip me to shreds and tell me that he could not love someone like me before posting publicly on his journal running me down before posting disturbing replies to some of the posts on my journal anonymously (but I recognized his ISP number so I know it was him even though he denied it) making it sound as though the whole thing was deliberate. I would not mind but it came out of the blue, the night before all this started he was discussing a work transfer to move to where I am and signed off with 'I love you'. Next day, wham. I am social phobic so do not really have many friends I cant talk to about this, my mother was usually the one id turn to but she is not here anymore, so my mood, although it usually lifts at this time of year, has taken a nose dive and I am having trouble getting myself motivated again. The emotional pain I felt on that Thursday was like nothing I had felt for years, I just literally felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest. I could not sleep and I could not eat for the best part of that week, although I am eating and sleeping again now. Am I over reacting to what he did, because I am hurt as hell and completely and utterly infuriated with him at the same time? I know I can be slightly prone to being a bit of a drama queen at times (over reacting to stuff) and I can sometimes be a little paranoid. But the whole thing felt deliberate as though he intentionally intended to hurt me, and even now when I try to contact him to get answers he is being spiteful and running me down. Of course after this I spat a whole load of vitriol at him and now I am being painted as the one that was in the wrong, and he is saying he did nothing that warranted the vitriol and is the innocent party in all of this. Of course he also interprets home truths as vitriol, and I tend to be very open and say things as I see them, to the point of lacking tact now and again. But whilst I am willing to stand up and say I made a few mistakes and apologize, he is acting as though the blame is all mine and he did nothing wrong. I just cannot seem to make him understand that the way he went about ending the relationship was one of the most hurtful ways anyone could have done it. I know he claims to suffer from bipolar disorder which he wont get treatment for, and I know that can make him highly moody, but I cant understand why he does not understand the hurt he caused me, or if he does, how someone who professed to love me, does not even seem to care. He seems totally and utterly cold, so cold it is chilling. I know he gets periods of emotional flatness because he told me, and he also told me he hears voices as well. Could he be suffering from some kind of depression related psychosis? One post he made to my journal was: Wisdom comes only to those who seek it, and sometimes to those who deserve it regardless of perfection, intent or even understanding. The common denominator though, seems to be deed. For one must do, or be done to, in order for wisdom to take root. Am I misreading that? Or reading into it? So am I over reacting? Was I wrong to argue back with him? How can I move on and get my motivation back again?","I have had recurrent unipolar depression since my mid teens with an associated anxiety disorder and a panic disorder that took root 5 years ago after I beat a drink problem I had at the time (between the age of 22 and 25 I used alcohol as a bit of a crutch which was a huge mistake).

It started because I transferred to online school and I thought it would be fine to stay up until 3 am or so, but it is gradually gotten worse and worse and as I am typing this it is 9 am and I am just now getting ready to sleep. I am guessing I will wake up at about 3 pm and actually get out of bed at 4. It is really screwing with my coursework and making my mental and physical health worse. People keep giving me reasonable advice like turning off distractions and forcing myself to go to bed, or even staying up the whole day so I am very tired by nighttime, but I just cannot find the willpower to go to sleep or get up. I am not motivated to do anything anymore that I do not have to do. I am starting to feel like a complete failure. Has anyone else experienced this or is experiencing it? (Also I am taking a lot of melatonin but it still does not motivate me to actually get into bed.)","Going to bed in the morning, waking up at night.

"I am a 23 year old female who has suffered from depression for the last 3 years. I remember having bouts of it in high school, hating myself and thinking i was ugly and worthless, but it generally passed and things got better. Then all of a sudden when i was 20, i just started crying constantly, feeling out of control, wanting to dig a hole and bury myself, not knowing what to do with myself, feeling hysterical. I went on medication after a few months, and things improved, but it is something i still deal with every day. I am at university full time, as well as working part time, and just feel like i am constantly on the edge of going insane. I just moved to a new city, and feel so lonely, wanting attention but i feel like no one is interested. Worst of all, i miss so much university (because i cannot get out of bed in the morning) that my tutors regard me as a bad student, which makes me feel so bad, because i know i am smarter than most of the people in our class. I just want everyone to know i am not lazy and boring, i just feel like my body is made of lead and i have no energy and no drive to get up in the morning. I have just started seeing a psychologist and she is really great, but it is so expensive i have to work extra shifts at work just to manage, which makes me even more stressed out! I do not want to take time off university because i took last year off and it made me feel worse. I really love my course and it is pretty much the only thing that gives me joy .. if only i could get out of bed to go! i am so angry at myself, my life was not meant to be like this..","I just want everyone to know i am not lazy and boring, i just feel like my body is made of lead and i have no energy and no drive to get up in the morning.

"My life is so hollow Stupid self pitying rant, sorry. Nobody cares about my existence. I have never been and cannot get into a relationship. I am stuck in this isolated suburb for the next 3 years of my life, drifting between my school and home. Usually I can occupy my mind with focusing on my looks or dreaming of the beautiful life i am going to have once i am free, but recently i have been having to do more school work (i am used to just stumbling through school without really focusing and getting above average grades but recently i have been having to actually work to compete with my peers) and I either reject it to stay in my dream world or get 10 minutes in and break down because it gives me time to realise how hollow my life is. Nothing feels authentic when i am here. There have been beautiful times in my life and 90% of them are when i have been abroad. I just feel so genuinely empty whenever I give myself chance to look around and realise how isolated I am from people and the world. And as a person who truly appreciates the beauty of human beings and life, this really hurts me.","Usually I can occupy my mind with focusing on my looks or dreaming of the beautiful life i am going to have once i am free, but recently i have been having to do more school work (i am used to just stumbling through school without really focusing and getting above average grades but recently i have been having to actually work to compete with my peers) and I either reject it to stay in my dream world or get 10 minutes in and break down because it gives me time to realise how hollow my life is."

"Hi, I am pretty sure I am suffering from depression, and probably have been for the last 18 months or so. It is only been lately that I feel like the rug has really been jerked out from under me, though. I think it started in mid-2004 when I became seriously ill. Between June and September 2004, I spent three weeks in the hospital, umpteen visits to the E/R, and finally, major surgery to correct the problem. Physically, I am fine now. But we had no health insurance (long story), and when the hospital bills started rolling in, we tried our best to pay the bills, but there was just no way. We ended up filing bankruptcy, I lost my home business, and we very nearly lost our home. Ever since then, I have felt like I am falling down a dark tunnel, even though the bankruptcy is over with. I was drinking part of this time, but have stopped, thinking that may have been causing the problem. But it is actually become worse since I have stopped. Here is my ""symptoms"": I do not usually have trouble falling asleep, but I cannot seem to stay asleep for more than a couple of hours. It is hard to go back to sleep, so I usually just get up. Weight gain because I find myself eating even when I am not hungry. The ""comfort food"" thing, I guess. I tend to be a ""stress"" eater, and goodness knows I have had a lot of that lately! I used to enjoy camping and reading books (etc.), but I do not care about any of that anymore. I could not sit down now and read a book no matter how much I wanted to. I get through 5 or 6 pages, and totally lose interest. That is depressing in itself, because I used to love reading so much. I have no desire to get out and do anything. I literally close myself up in my spare bedroom every waking hour, only coming out to use the bathroom and to fix supper for my husband. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I am not happy, but I cannot pinpoint exactly what would make me happy. I honestly cannot think of anything. I have no energy whatsoever. I have been dealing with a TON of guilt over the bankruptcy. After all, the bankruptcy would not have happened if I had not gotten sick, you know? I feel horrible for dragging my husband is credit down along with mine, but the way things were, I could not file bankruptcy by myself. Our credit was PERFECT until I got sick. My husband sold a bunch of his personal belongings to help pay bills, as did I, but it was so unfair for him to have lost his stuff on account of me. He is never once complained, but I still feel terrible. I have also been kicking myself for the loss of my home business. I cannot help but feel like if it had not failed (I could not keep up with it during my illness), that we would not have had to file bankruptcy. I have never been a crier, but I sure feel like it sometimes. I cannot seem to do anything ""right"" these days. Irritable!! Throwing stuff, being unreasonable, getting mad about petty things. The one thing I have not experienced (thankfully) is suicidal thoughts. A few random ""morbid"" thoughts here and there, but nothing I would ever act on. Last night I took several online self-tests, and all of them said I had mild to moderate depression. One even said severe. I guess the next step would be to go to the doctor, but I do not have a doctor. My sister is taking Zoloft for panic attacks and a PMS disorder, so I guess I will ask her who she is seeing. What do they do .. just ask questions similar to the online questionnaires? Or? I have been reading about all the different kids of medicines, and found the information about Wellbutrin to be the most interesting. Obviously the doctor would know what I need better than I would, but I sure do not want to take something that is going to make me gain even more weight or feel like a zombie. At least one good thing, though. We do, thankfully, have insurance now. Another issue is my husband and family. To them, depression is something that people should be able to ""just shake off"". They do not understand that I CAN'T seem to ""shake it off"", otherwise, I gladly would. My husband is supportive in other ways, but he scoffed when my sister started taking Zoloft. To them, if they cannot ""see"" the problem, it does not exist. I am sure they do not mean to be ""mean"", but they just do not understand. Sorry for rambling. Any suggestions or thoughts?","It is only been lately that I feel like the rug has really been jerked out from under me, though.

"How is it going, all who read. My name is Greg, I am 19 and have had depression for basically as long as I remember. Here is a brief history of my journey through depression and the treatments I have endeavored. I began on lexapro. It seemed to be helping and then it quit on me (or perhaps vice versa). After that I tried zoloft, and wellbutrin, but to the same effect. Then I turned my world to narcotics (mainly, marijuana and DXM). They helped ALOT, but because they are illegal, I felt a constant public stigma and guilt. I could not take it, despite the amazing effects of both drugs. I am now taking Paxil CR, but I am going to quit it because it is not working. I am beginning to lose hope altogether. It seems apparent to me that SSRIs just are not for me, or maybe I just have not found the right one. The real problem with depression is that you have to wait a month on each drug just to see it it is going to work. Those months can feel like years. Anyways, that is who I am. I hope to make a few friends here, and a lot of advice as well. Does anyone one else share these symptoms (if so, and if you think you can help contact me please): Chronic fatigue, lack of motivation/desire, inability to enjoy life, insomnia (including the other obvious and supplementing symptoms) The real killer is I know I have the potential to be someone great, but I have to become happy first..Greg","It seemed to be helping and then it quit on me (or perhaps vice versa).

"Maybe They are Wrong About It All We are always told ""when you are depressed, your brain is lying to you about how bad everything is"". What if they are wrong? If someone is piss poor and starving, cannot pay their bills, replace their moth-eaten clothes or go out to do interesting things, surely their money situation really IS as bad as all that. If someone has no family, no friends and has been bullied/abused by everyone they have met in life, perhaps their social situation really IS as bad as all that. If someone has had lots of physical health issues like cancer, chronic pain, obesity etc, maybe their physical woes really ARE as bad as all that. Some people go through all of the above, all at once. So maybe life IS as bad as all that for them. The whole ""your brain is lying about how bad things are"" thing often just feels like ""you are just imagining your problems"". Like, I know depression etc make your brain incapable of dealing with them properly, but it does not mean legitimate problems do not exist and that some people is lives are not thoroughly worthless all the same.","Maybe They are Wrong About It All We are always told ""when you are depressed, your brain is lying to you about how bad everything is""."
"Nice to see you too!! How are you today? I think you really have hit the mark on what I was trying to express with this question - all the negativity and darkness that is contained in almost every media outlet you can name. The disasters you mention, such real human tragedy but the way the media went after it was appalling and seemed to be muddled in politics and ratings. As for those forensic shows - ugh! I used to be able to watch them but way before this recent ""episode"" of mine I stopped. I could not stand the heartache of knowing what evil lurks out there. Where I work now one of the first friends I made was a gentleman who has since retired. He told me that he did not read the news, watch TV or listen to the radio (except for light jazz) because he found that to do so was just too much pain, it did not ""serve"" him to subject himself to that kind of pain. He seemed to be generally very happy and upbeat to me so there must be something to it. As for your friend - that is a tough one but maybe since she is your friend she might understand if you explain to her how incredibly painful her TV choices are on you. Does she ever read or post here? Anyway, it is GREAT talking with you again and I look forward to the next chat. I hope you have a wonderful day and weekend.","He told me that he did not read the news, watch TV or listen to the radio (except for light jazz) because he found that to do so was just too much pain, it did not ""serve"" him to subject himself to that kind of pain.

"Get myself to be more active/alive? So, my depression is getting worse and worse since a few years. I am in law school and I am in the last year of preparation - in our country, this is THE BUSIEST TIME ever for those students - like, they start studying at 7 in the morning at stay until 11 in the night at the library. nonstop studying for 1-1,5 years in preparation for the big exams. I started last october. it is july. I have maybe studied on two or three days, seriously. the other time, I just sit at home, in a kind of weird freeze. I am BORED out of my mind, my brain is longing for some activity, and I actually really want to be all busy and studying and feel like I have a purpose. It is like I know exactly how important it is now, and my brain is screaming at me to get my books out and start doing what I want to do. But I just sit here. Heck, if I am procrastinating so bad, at least I could have fun, party, travel, meet people, see the world, at least not waste my time or waste it in a way that is at least fun! But I am still sitting here. Like in a shock. It feels like it is too late for the studying thing (exams are in spring and I have no idea about the subjects and skip all classes I am paying for) and I have no idea what else to do with my time. It does not help that over the last two years, I kinda developed an eating disorder with anorexic, bulimic and binge-eating-tendencies that also made my health decline. I am constantly thinking about numbers, looking up nutritional infos, reading medical studies, looking at food online - it is taking so much space in my head although I am quite 'close to my goal', and I should not even worry because if I keep doing what I planned (restrict for another 4-5 weeks, then slowly up my calories until I no longer lose weight, stay at maintenance and start to slowly incorporate exercise to finally be healthy, eating healthy, and exercising to maintain good health), there is no reason to be so occupied with this topic. Any idea how to get myself to get up and DO SOMETHING? The sitting around is what is probably making me most depressed, because I watch my life burn down and kind of cannot do anything about. PLEASE do not suggest to get professional help.

"When people ask you what you did for the weekend, or for your birthday, etc. I have no idea how to respond. My emotions have become so numb that I cannot feel anything so therefore I cannot enjoy anything I used to like doing. I literally just go to work everyday for 8 hours, come home and browse the news and reddit and listen to music, trying to entertain myself but never really succeeding. There is nothing I can enjoy. So when someone asks me what I did I just say some crap like I just relaxed at home or something, I do not know what else to say. It is the worst part about depression for me. Not being able to enjoy anything. I do not even look forward to coming home from work because it is not like I have anything to enjoy at home. It is all the same dullness. I would probably work 12-14 hours a day seven days a week if I could because it would not bother me at all, I am not missing out on anything.

SN, I hear what you are saying about not being able to weather another strike against your stability now. And I hope you do not have to go. I will pray with you that you are spared from the cuts this time, but while you are praying and hoping, consider the issue of your personal power. If you are feeling shaky in other areas of life, I doubt that you feel that you have any. I have been in that situation over many things.

It was an eye-opener for me. Perhaps it can help you at this juncture. In your own prayers, remember to ask God not just for the optimal decision to be made on your behalf, but for the power to see where you do and do not have control and for help taking charge of the areas that you actually can control. When you are in a phase of instability, it seems that more and more garbage gets thrown your way. But a turning point comes when the indignation of being tossed on everyone else is sea propels you into action. That turning point came for me about 9 years ago when a really awful roommate had to be ejected.

"For those on antidepressants, is it working? Alternatives to antidepressants? Okay so I am going back to a psychiatrist next week for my depression. I have been going since high school and over the years have had depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, lack of motivation and interest, high anxiety, numbness, hopelessness, etc etc. recently it is been coming back. I have been on Zoloft which made me feel like a numb zombie and bupropion which I did not feel was working.

"I have posted a few times on these forums and everyone has always been so helpful and supportive, so I am hoping I can get some help with this. For the last few weeks, my depression has been so horrendous, worse than it is ever been, that I have not been able to go to work. I keep calling in sick, and then when I can finally make myself go, I hide in the bathroom crying or go to an empty office (not in my cubicle) and call my mother and cry to her. I have been in touch with my pdoc, who is in the process of passing me off to another doctor. Granted, it is at my request, as he is not on my insurance. However, he is not willing to put me on any other types of medications since he will not be seeing me regularly. I have spoken to my long - time pdoc from Dallas, my hometown, and he knows me very well. I trust him more than any other doctor, which is not saying much, but he says that I am unipolar, aka major depressive disorder, and a mood stabilizer would be the next best thing to try since all the antidepressants are not working. (was taking 30mg celexa, just upped to 40mg when this all started.) I am seeing a new pdoc that is covered by my insurance on Monday, so maybe things will move forward. Ok, so back to the work thing. My supervisor is not sympathetic to my problem. In all fairness, I have not told her details. I find that most people do not consider mental disease a real medical problem. She suggested that I talk to Human Resources about taking some type of leave if I do not know when I will be better. I am working on that and hoping one of these doctors will sign for me. The biggest problem I have is the guilt over missing work. I never imagined that the depression could get so bad that I could not just suit up and show up. That is been my motto every time things get rough. I guess I am looking for validation here. If I really do have it in my to get to work, I certainly cannot find it. I am a very responsible person, so this is not like me. The only time I have ever called in sick is when I was having depression issues, but never more than one day. Everyone gets a sick day, and I never get the flu or anything, so I do not feel guilty about those days. What do I do? Am I looking at this the wrong way? It is so hard to be objective when you are so low. My saving grace is that my parents (who are far away in Dallas) are being the most supportive people in the world. They believe me when I say I just cannot get to work, since that is not like me, but that is not like them either, so I know they want me to get there if I can.

Granted it is still in the same agency as my last job down here, but different division. It is good though that I can just walk down the street during lunch and have lunch with the girls from my old office. I did miss them and their good gossip. By my birthday in September we will all be in the same building, we move in August and they do on my birthday, so that will be fun! While I was pregnant I was sure I would want to be a stay at home mom. After having Toby I thought I did then as well.. 6 months later and I was dying to get out of the house and back to work. I do miss him but I do not envy my husband is job of taking care of him and the house and our pacifier business while I get rest at work. I get to have lunch, take my time and go to the bathroom when I need to, and talk to real adults about non baby stuff in non baby speak. And the best part - I am getting out of the house! And I have a reason to not wear pajamas all day. I also really do appreciate my time with Toby more. I do not see it as a chore anymore. Phew.","Two weeks later and I am on day one of a higher paying, with benefits, permanent job with these people.

"Hi, after 2 posts on the DF I am finally beginning to work out the format. Excuse the typo is as going through Prozac withdrawals and kind of shaky! I am 27 years old, I live in the UK, Studied psychology, trained psychiatric nurse, behavior family therapist, and trainee CB therapist. Not sure if I can go back to my CBT course as I have missed so much time from university due to my current episode. This is my worst episode ever. I have had depression for 8 years, and have been ashamed and embarrassed by it. As my life seems to be ebbing away, I have come out with it and seeking psychiatric help. My problem has been that I work in psychiatry and have feared loosing my job/career. It means everything to me. It is the only thing I have and could not bare seeing it go down the toilet. Friends do not understand and know how to discuss the topic with me. My family does not know as it would devastate an already broken family. For 8 years I have suffered in silence, cried silent screams, been tormented by my own brain. I hate imagining living a life like this especially when the long term effects I am reminded of every day (my patients). The only person I had was my ex girlfriend, we split last year. CAUSE? me. Stress got the better of me, my thinking became screwed and I have lost her, for life. She was the only one I could talk to, some one I had known for, 12 odd years. Depression has ruined my life. This episode has been an eye opener. This is the first time planet earth is hearing about my struggle. Something, which may have otherwise been lost. My secrets buried with me. Do not confuse this as a suicide note. It is not. It is me talking about things in this way for the first time. I am over the crisis point but nowhere near my usual self and need to sort my medicines out with my doctor as soon as possible. I have had a brave chat with my boss who is going to sort out a psychiatrist in the next 10 days, all being well. I have only taken one OD in 1998 with a serious intent to kill myself. Doctors said I survived as I woke up. For years I have avoided talking about it, never wanted to see a psychiatrist but realize now (well for now) that there is 2 people inside me. One is me, the other is depression and to stand the best chance of staying well and keeping well then I need to face I have a problem. Around 3 weeks ago I was so actively suicidal, I was thinking of jumping off a bridge into the river, i searched the internet for ways to kill myself. I am out of that acute phase but do not trust myself. I have tried SSRIs but they just do not agree with me so it looks like I am going back on Mirtazapine. I stopped taking it sometime ago as I put on weight. Since last year I have lost 2 stone through diet and exercise. In the last 3 weeks I have lost 4 lbs as a result of depression. Right now my mind is blank. I have never chatted to anyone on this forum before but I know you guys know what I am going through. My life has never been the same since 1998. It never will be. My dad died in 2002 since then things have worsened. I have so much to say I could write on but going to leave it for now. You guys are the first to hear my full (well pretty full) story. I have never had the courage to speak like this before. Bye for now","I have had depression for 8 years, and have been ashamed and embarrassed by it.

"10 years I have been managing depression and I was doing well, until last Monday. Quick back story: 38/m/Ireland. I was a competitive Powerlifter and represented my country on 2 occasions with great success. My life was lifting; setting goals, reaching targets, smashing PBs..all helped with creating a future for myself. I started to feel unwell around December 2016 and developed a persistent, non-productive cough. Series of tests led me to an echocardiograph where it was discovered I was suffering Heart Failure. Dilated Cardio Myopathy caused by a viral infection, left my hearts function at 20%EF. Apparently I had a few months to live if I had not caught it. Ironically, now, I wish they had not discovered it. My world flipped upside down. No Powerlifting, no excessive exercise, restricted fluid intake, no over exertion, meds for the rest of my life, regular reviews in my heart clinic, multiple ambulance emergency rides to A&amp;E when my heart goes irregular. Hospital, pharmacy, hospital, pharmacy.. Seems to be my life for the past year. Last Monday I snapped. It hit me. Everything I lost came crashing in on me. I got in my car, picked a place I knew well to ram my car into at 120mph. I was screaming at myself to do it. My left hand steering towards the end, my right hand steering me to survive. An image of my dog in my mind kept me on the road. I knew she would miss me too much. I am still very low now despite all my meds. I still wish I had gone through with it. I still think of going to the Cliffs of Moher and jumping.. What a beautiful place to end it. I am dreading the road ahead because I know how Rocky it is going to be.. Help me please.","My life was lifting; setting goals, reaching targets, smashing PBs..all helped with creating a future for myself.

"I am Weakest At Night.. I do not understand the reason for this, but for as long as I can remember I have always been weakest during the night time. I feel weak mentally, emotionally, physically, internally.. I feel like I cannot go on, like I cannot keep fighting, like I have had enough.. I freeze over, my body locks up, my fear paralyzes me, and my mind becomes my enemy.. Night seems endless because I cannot see much of anything no matter where I try to look. From minor fears to worst nightmares stalk me like I am nothing but an insignificant prey who is time has come. I am exhausted and need sleep, but only nightmares haunt me or the fear of being attacked while I am immobile by unconsciousness.. And yet, though a part of me yearns for light, for the warm comfort of the sun, it only depresses me. In the light I can see what I truly am, I can see a reflection of something I have grown to hate. When I look at my reflection I want to smash the mirror so I can no longer see the truth of my insignificant existence. In the light I can see everyone else, either continuing on with their lives without a thought of me or a second glance. Or I see other people like me suffering and it both hurts and gives me a strange, and possibly, a cruel comfort. I hate seeing other is suffer, but I am so insignificant I am helpless that I might as well be dead.. I need the light and yet it hurts me..","From minor fears to worst nightmares stalk me like I am nothing but an insignificant prey who is time has come.

"I just told all 100 students I teach I have depression in an email about finals week I am an undergraduate TA at a university, in an interdisciplinary class about the brain. I absolutely love being a TA, but admittedly this quarter it has been a struggle mentally, I often feel anxious that I am doing a horrible job. I sent out this email to all 100 of my students about finals: Hi everyone, These next two weeks will be a really, really tough time for all of you. I know how incredibly hard you all have worked this quarter, and how hard you will push yourselves during this final stretch, but there are 2 other things I want you to know: 1) I, the other TAs, and our professor will not be disappointed if you do not perform as well you want, so you should not be either. Tests and grades are not always the best reflection of you as students/scientists, and they are most certainly are not a reflection of your worth as a person. All a test assesses is how much content you remember and how well you can take a test at a certain time on a certain day. It is simply one data point, and as you should all know by now, 1 data point is not representative of the population. For many of you, you have other finals/presentations/responsibilities going on, and it will be difficult to find time to study. For others, you may want so badly to study a lot, but cannot because you are so stressed and anxious. I personally deal with anxiety and depression, and I know how utterly frustrating it is when your mind does not work as well as you want it to. 2) Take care of yourself. Eat good food, get some sleep, spend time with people you love. So, while you prepare for finals these next weeks, keep these two things in mind. You are all incredibly curious, kind, intelligent and important people. I brag all the time that I get to work with the most amazing group of students who bring unique and valuable contributions to this class everyday, and inspire me to be the best TA I can possibly be. Cheering you on!! ~austen1996 (I cannot believe I just told all my students about my mental illness, but it honestly feels so liberating to do so. It also feels so hypocritical of me to send this, because I attribute much of my self-worth to academics and do not practice much self-care..but I felt like this needed to be said).","I just told all 100 students I teach I have depression in an email about finals week I am an undergraduate TA at a university, in an interdisciplinary class about the brain.

"I am a 42 year old woman who is single and has no one ""special"" in my life. I am becoming my disgusted with my life and where I am. I really want to make 2006 my year. Yes I have said that every year since I turned 18. I am at the lowest point that I did not want to reach. I am afraid to sink any lower. I am currently on effexor and linispril. Effexor is started to have a negative effect on my heath, but I am so afraid of returning night terrors that I am afraid to allow my doctor to change it. I am seeing a counselor but he is not working on my cognitive behavior. I need someone to tell me positive things and to help me believe that I am not bad. He just seems to repeat what I say. I had someone before who focused on my thought patterns and it helped greatly.","I am a 42 year old woman who is single and has no one ""special"" in my life.

"Hello Tommy! to DF! I am glad you joined! This board is a great place for information and support. Take your time browsing through the topics. I am sure there will be lots of things you can relate to. When you feel comfortable enough, feel free to share any of your thoughts, questions, concerns, experiences, etc..Congrats on taking your first steps towards recovery! I think it takes a lot of courage to start treatment. I know it took me quite a while to admit to myself I could not handle my situation on my own any longer. I think you did great starting on both talk therapy and medicines! I hope you find therapy useful and that you and your therapist can work towards better skills to cope with the stressors in your life. Concerning your medication. There is a room dedicated to your antidepressant Prozac. You will find lots of information there. Check it out sometime. One of the downsides of antidepressants is the fact that it takes a while for them to kick in. You only started about 10 days ago so you will have to give the Prozac some time to be able to fully benefit from it. Meanwhile I hope you are not having too many side effects! Tom, thanks for joining. Keep us posted on how you are doing! Take good care of yourself!","I am glad you joined!

"I have really hit a new low I cannot believe how depressed I am right now, I am just imploding. I got fired from yet another job for being incompetent as usual. Usually I am pretty good at bouncing back but this job just broke something inside me. I am a damn failure. Three attempts at college. Flunked out after the first year. That is ok, college is not for everyone. Try a bunch of min wage jobs. Get fired or quit with in the first month or two. I cannot do damn thing. I have no motivation to do anything at all anymore. I used to clock around 3-4 hours a day gaming because it was something I genuinely enjoyed. I have gotten 30 minutes in an entire damn week. I literally just cannot muster the strength to want to do it. I have been pulling away from people because it is just exhausting to talk to them. I literally just get tired after five minutes of conversation. It is insane. We will barely be through the how is your day been going before I already want to go somewhere else because it is so draining. I have hit a complete rock wall in therapy. I tell my therapist nearly all of this shit and she helps me as best she can but there is only so much she is able to do. She has no magic way of instilling me with motivation. Like.. to put it into perspective. I stared at a wall for 2 hours today. Because I just was to tired to anything else. 2 hours! I was not thinking about anything. I was not being bored. I just do not have motivation to do anything! But what is worse is the moment I start thinking again is the moment all the sadness washes over me. It is like I am in the middle of a vast, dark ocean and cannot find shore. I swim and I swim and I swim but salvation is just nowhere to be seen. And I am beginning to grow tired. I have no future ahead of me. Nothing to look forward too. I go through thousands of career tests and applications and all I see is that I am either not interested enough or not good enough for any career. And I cannot simply work for money. Money in and of itself just is not good enough for me to work at a job I hate or am completely uninterested in. That is the strain of these minimum wage jobs, some of them I have had to quit because they have literally made me suicidal. I am so lost right now. The world looks like a very dark place where I have to suffer in agony just to get by. I am so tired of fighting. I am so tired of trying. I am just. So. Tired. It has been a very long time since I have been this low. I feel like I am doomed. Like this is all the happiness I will ever be afforded. That even if I get the job of my dreams and all the money I could possibly want, I will always have a big, dark cloud hanging over my head. Everything hurts and I hate everything about life right now. I wish I could just fall asleep and stay in my dreams.","I have really hit a new low I cannot believe how depressed I am right now, I am just imploding.

"I am so depressed I do not know what to do Dropped out of school, have been unemployed for two months, have absolutely no friends and spend my days browsing reddit. Every single day is the same.

"I think I am depressed but I am not sure I do not know what the fuck is wrong with me but I think I might have depression. 1) I love going out with friends. I am very active person, but lately for example even when I am laughin I suddenly stop and get very sad. I do not know what is wrong but I get very sad and I lose interest in doing everything. 2) Lately I can not focus. I have never been fun of doing homework but I was always doing it. Now I just cannot I am just laying bad instead of doing homework. You might say I am been lazy but also I am music producer and I absolutely love music, but lately I just cannot. When I sit down I just cannot focus on it and I end up going to bad after 15 minutes. 3) I am sleepy all the time and I am sad most of the times. I do not have specific reasons but I am. 4) I became very insecure. It feel like my friend do not like me. I feel like they do not want me to be around them and I just do not know why. 5) Most of the times on weekdays I am just laying on my bad and listening sad music and I feel like I am wasting my time.

"Girlfriend attempted to break her arm to avoid going to work My girlfriend began her summer job in a hospital earlier this summer where she mostly cleans and prepares meals for the patients. She has been pretty upfront about the fact that she is stressed during the days and does not want to go to work most days. Since we do not live together we see eachother about three times per week although less during summer since work prohibits that to an extent. She has never during our two year long relationship showed any signs of self harm nor depression. However, today i saw her for the first time this week and I noticed bruises on her fore arm. She unwillingly explained that she had tried to break her arm in order to not have to go to work anymore for the rest of the summer. She said that she had had a panic attack and in desperation smashed her arm into a metal pole in order to break her arm. She promised to let me know if she felt that way again but I am not sure if she is going to. She also made me promise to not tell anyone about it. How can I help prevent her from harming herself another time? What other things are there that I should be aware of concerning her well being? I hope this is the proper sub for this and I would be very thankful for your advice.","Girlfriend attempted to break her arm to avoid going to work My girlfriend began her summer job in a hospital earlier this summer where she mostly cleans and prepares meals for the patients.

"I do not even know I do not know if I am depressed or just the good 'ol sad. I cannot fully express how I feel because the inside of my head is a mess. I do not want to give what I feel everyday the label of ""depression"", I feel like it just insults the people who knows they have depression. I have no idea where to get any help for whatever I feel. If I did, I would either be too lazy or too shy to ask. I am too lazy. Everything is just too tedious. In everything I do, halfway through it I just feel an intense urge to give up, and I do. I cannot find a proper hobby to distract myself from whatever is inside my head. I cannot focus. It is so hard to focus on anything. I just stared at the blinking blue bar for 5 minutes just to type this unecessary sentence, because I lost whatever I wanted to write here in the maelstrom of thoughts inside my head. I used to be smart, or atleast feel smart. Lately I feel like I have dumbed down. Questions that I used to answer easily became hard for me. English, something I was proud of for learning it by myself, became harder for me. My memory is not what it used to be. I am jealous of other people who can properly comfort their depressed loved ones. Everytime, it pains me that I cannot find anything in my head or say anything to make them feel atleast a little better. It eats me inside that I know they are suffering and I cannot make them feel that someone cares when they think that no-one does. I am a fake. i am not sure if any of you will get what I am saying but, eh. I cannot even understand myself.","I cannot fully express how I feel because the inside of my head is a mess.

"I joined yesterday and have been reading through some of the posts. Thought I had better introduce my self. I live in the UK. Looking back on my life I think I have always had depression. It got worse though, 3.5 years ago after the birth of my son. I though i had PND at the time. I was always crying, felt really low and would panic if I was left alone with the baby. It put a huge strain on my marriage and lots of arguments because my husband though I had gone off him. I went back to work put could not cope, lack of motivation etc. but like someone said below I put on a 'happy face' to make people think that I was OK. I muddled through for a year then went to see a GP who put me on Prozac. Stupid me came off it after 2 months thinking I was OK. Slowly the depression came back, I was not coping with my job, the simplest tasks at work and at home were impossible to face, I could not concentrate or make decisions. Last Spring it all got too much. I was getting up crying every morning, I became agoraphobic. I phoned in work and said i could not go in. I saw the GP and went on Prozac. I took 2 months off work. I stayed on Prozac until last September. And then, guess what, it all came back with a vengeance a few months ago. This time I was also feeling suicidal which really scared me. So I am now back on the Prozac and determined to stay on it. I think I have generalized depression made worse by circumstances. The birth of my son, trying to keep a job down and be a Mom, and my husband. Last year my husband really turned to alcohol and ended up ill in hospital. He has been on incapacity benefit ever since, so our relationship and our finances have really suffered. He has changed to. Even though he says he loves me he gets angry a lot, shouts at me, criticizes me, puts me down. I do not know how much more of it I can take, without leaving him. I make excuses for him, that it is his illness and lack of earning power that make him like that but it is no excuse to turn me into a nervous wreck who is scared to say anything in case he shoots me down. The Prozac has reduced but not removed my depression and I still have the odd day where I want to run away. I keep thinking 'will it go away if I leave my husband?' I no longer love him but life has dealt a difficult blow to us both recently and maybe one day when the stresses have been removed I will love him again. Anyway that is my story (sounds similar to Vanyas who i have PM would).","It got worse though, 3.5 years ago after the birth of my son.

"Rolling down hill Hi all, It all started last year when I quit my bachelor in Physical Therapy. That study didnt seem right for me and I dropped out in feb 2016. From februari till september I have worked a depressing job in an order picking centre to pay for my next year of college. But after that there wasnt any motivation for anything left over in me. This year I started a new study, lifesciences. It started all fun for the first two months. Because we had the basics of chemistry, anatomy, algebra and physics. But in the beginning of november the second semester started and thus I had tests from the first semester. Failed them all. In the weeks leading to the tests I couldnt concentrate or motivate myself to do anything. I was just at my room doing absolutely nothing. 14 november was my birthday, turned 19. Everyone forgot it except my gf (for 2,5 years). Was a fun day and made me forget the test results and gave me a little hope. Today she told me she was seeing someone else for the last 3 months because I had too little time to see her, because I was always busy with school. Im feeling that everything is worse. My job sucks but I have to keep it as I got to keep up with school costs. Already got pretty hefty debt from those two halve years of university. I just feel that everything that I do fails. Like the last 2 years I have accomplished nothing. I would like to travel if I am going to have my second gap year but my funds wouldnt allow it. Working would be my only option but the only jobs that are available will push me over the edge. But there is something good at the horizon; there is a small chance I am getting accepted in to the police academy, but that is only a small chance so no big hopes as that makes it worse.","Rolling down hill Hi all, It all started last year when I quit my bachelor in Physical Therapy.

"Anxiety and Depression make you contradict and lose yourself I have had enough. I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for months and the whole situation is fucking my mind up. I know I should face my problems but I do not want to and that amplifies my anxiety. I just wish people ignored me and yet I feel lonely. I do not want to be hurt and yet I am the one hurting myself. There is so many things I would like to do but in the end I end up wasting time on the bed. There is many things I want and yet I cannot bring myself to work and get them.

"say what You know what? THIS IS FUCKING RIDICOLOUS. I got rejected from yet another interview, although I hate any kind of job - it is all stupid as hell, fuck wageslavery, fuck every company, fuck everyone who plays this psychotic game, and thinks it is what normal people do. Why was I born in a third-world country that will not pay shit for people with severe anxiety like I have. I SIMPLY CAN'T INTERACT WITH PEOPLE, It is not my fault I do not have anything in common with narcisstic crazyass bastards like you. - So when did you graduate? - In 2014 - So what have you been doing this whole time? - I have been doing YOUR MOM. It is none of your business what I have been doing. I have been meditating for the aliens to come and extinct this rotten place you people occupied. Okay, yeah, I admit, I used google translator, goddamnit, for your stupid nonsense article, how fucking awful is that? The translation is accurate and shit. Well, awful enough for the sole reason of using it. Oh well then, sorry for wasting your time. I got rejected from a call-centre - a place where homeless fellows should not go. Things never go my way, man, I cannot stand it, but I am supposed to, fucking ridicolous.

"Does this mean i need antidepressants? How are you supposed to feel when you take them &amp; they are effective? i have been feeling depressed since i was 19, i am 21 now. i learned to live with my depression. i took group therapy, then individual therapy but did not find comfort/could not open up to my therapists. i do not talk to anyone about my issues, so kinda now have a feeling of numbness. i kinda learned to live like this. i feel normal, i used to feel like there was a cloud over my head at all times.

Why am I so bad at everything I am even bad at my own hobbies. I have been producing music since like sophomore year of high school and 4 years later I am still trash. I have went to the gym and tried to be consistent but I am too stupid to work out alone and even though I watch videos on form I feel like my form is always shitty. I am shitty at talking to people and making friends. Im losing all my friends because my depression makes me distance myself away from people in hopes of them noticing my absence but no one notices. I am shitty at school. I am shitty at driving. I am shitty at talking to girls. I just prefer to lay down in bed and listen to good music that I will never be able to make due to my lack of standing out as a producer.,I am shitty at talking to people and making friends.
"I am overwhelmed by guilt over my boyfriend is sexual assault of my once-best friend. My boyfriend of 2 years and I both suffer from mental health issues and trauma. I found out somewhat recently that months ago, when my then-best friend was sleeping over we were both asleep in the bed and he touched her sexually. Apparently he was stoned and thought he might start a threesome (it was casually mentioned as a possibility earlier). I know what he did was horrible. It makes me sick to my stomach to think that I was there and could not help. It makes me throw up and stay up at night knowing that I stayed with him. On the other hand, he himself is absolutely sick with guilt. He is been having non-stop anxiety attacks, crying spells, and moments of catatonia and he cannot stop saying how horrible it was that he did that and how he wants to be a good person. I believe he is genuine and my first reaction is to make sure he gets treatment so nothing close to that ever happens again. He checked himself into a psychiatric ward last night. I am also so overwhelmed by guilt by how selfish my internal response has been. He has cheated on me before multiple times, and I cannot help but ruminate on how if I were prettier this would not have happened and how it effects me. One recent (smaller) time just happened and I have had to take care of his emotions while being angry about this main terrible incident and that one. Furthermore, I am selfishly worried about how badly this is affecting me. One of the few (maybe only?) things going right in my life is school and this is affecting me so negatively in my inability to concentrate or motivate myself. I am also upset by how critical others have been of me in this even though they are at least partially justified. He posted his story to Reddit and got mostly cautious support. I posted mine and got a lot of messages calling me a pervert, an enabler, a shitposter, and a terrible person. He told his parents and one of the things they said was ""all three of you made mistakes"". Unrelated, but last night he posted a photo of us in the ER and a girl who hates me replied ""ew you are back with her? Nonono what are you doing."" I have no idea what I have done to make everyone in my life hate me this much.

"The world needs more ""lollipop moments"". Back in middle school, I was helping out at a sunday school, tutoring primary kids. There was this adorable little girl who was struggling to sing the right tunes of a hymn. Even though I have absolutely no musical background, I tried to help her get her vocals and lyrics right by singing the hymn together. Eventually, I told her to continue repeating it herself and that every practice is an improvement from the last. She would call me frequently just to sing her new hymns and I would challenge her to learn a new hymn every week, this routine went on for quite a while between ourselves.. Fast forward to today, I am currently a struggling undergrad students coping with depression and stress and well as deteriorating health due to extreme fatigue. Bad grades and crippling financial debt are the least of my concerns. Many days I would feel tired and unmotivated to do anything.. and barely making it to lectures only to zone off. At days I would think of suicide as well. There was nobody I could turn to that I felt I could relate to or even understand me.. It was not until a few days ago I received an email from the girl is mother, the girl was unfortunately diagnosed with an illness that made her lose up to 90% of her hearing. However, she was recently accepted to a prestigious musical academy, and sent me the audition tape of her performance thanking me for my encouragement. That song that she performed, was the very first hymn she struggled when I first came up to her. Knowing that the girl went through so much hardship just to chase the dream I stimulated her from her youth gave me so much hope at the darkest point of my life. Knowing that I had the capacity to influence a big change in a little girls life gave me the purpose to live. Even though I had to wait for 8 years for this news, it was worth it.

"Post-Graduation Depression I recently graduated from college, and over the past couple of months I have grown increasingly depressed. I feel this profound sense of loss and it feels as if the color has drained from the world. What is shocking to me is that I honestly hated college - I was either working or studying 24x7. I rarely had a single moment for myself or friends and was constantly exhausted and anxious. Now, I have a great job, live with my girlfriend, have almost no debt (thanks to working so much in college), and live in my ideal area.

"Advice on where to post for advice on taking antidepressants. Hi, UK based poster - I have recently taken my Doctors advice and got a prescription for antidepressants. I have been in-and-out of various states of mild to severe depression throughout my teens &amp; twenties, but I have always figured this is just something everyone has to deal with at some stage or another, so I have never sought help even when falling off a proverbial cliff edge. After much deliberation, someone I care deeply about got me to try counselling, but I find that I am really not getting much out of it right now, as I do not have the will to try, and my focus is all over the place (I am being tested for ADHD too, but I am still awaiting the results). My Doctor suggested trying a combination of antidepressants and CBT (the latter of which I am currently attempting to source a support group for), however I have an underlying phobia of long-term medication after seeing several people close to me, use it as a crutch and just become something wholly unfamiliar to me as a result. I have been prescribed Citalopram (Celexa for those stateside) but like I said - I have deep-seated reservations about taking them and before I tried, I wanted to see if there was anywhere/anyone I could talk to about their experiences on the drug and any perhaps any suggestions they could offer about managing short-term (6-9 months) antidepressant medication? I have looked at the sub-reddit rules for this group and I am not sure if this crosses rule 3; if so, can someone help me find the right place to ask my question(s)?","My Doctor suggested trying a combination of antidepressants and CBT (the latter of which I am currently attempting to source a support group for), however I have an underlying phobia of long-term medication after seeing several people close to me, use it as a crutch and just become something wholly unfamiliar to me as a result."

"I seem to have depression the worst, first thing in the morning lately. Just started with a new pdoc after 7 months. with another pdoc since this latest episode occured. My old pdoc thought I could have a mild bipolar disorder but was not sure. My 20 mg of prozac had stopped working after several years of keeping me stable. She started me on lamictal and I am now up to 100 mg / day. Stopped the prozac in early January and got worse, but not right away. I was having a good week / bad week type pattern depending on where I was in my menstrual cycle while I was on the prozac. I have battled depression on and off for 20 years. Particularly bad postpartum and this recent episode. I am 41 years old and have not felt this bad since I had my daughter 8 years ago. My new doctor thinks I do not have an ounce of bipolar and that I am just in a depression (I tend to agree with her). We decided together to add Lexapro to the mix and see if that helps me level out all the days of the month.

I seem to get moving and can be quite productive during my day after I take the Lamictal / xanax - do not know if this is a placebo effect??

"I am gonna die a virgin. No one likes me and I have no friends. My masculinity, self-esteem, and sense of self-worth have been destroyed thoroughly and are simply nonexistent anymore. I do not even bother trying anymore, I just wallow in my own sadness and escapist entertainment trying to find a reason to continue living with the fact that I am worthless. No woman would ever be into me and I am gonna die a virgin. I cannot even find solace in masturbation because whenever I see any sort of porn I go deep into a depression again because seeing two people enjoying each other makes me envious. I have no friends and now I do not think I can make any. I cannot make friends with people I do not know how to do anything right man.",No woman would ever be into me and I am gonna die a virgin.
"lonely Despite having great family that thinks the world of me, I just feel so damn alone all the time. I have great friends that reassure me that I am not alone, but I struggle forcing myself to believe that. I hate this about myself because I am grateful to have what I have, and I am god awful at showing my appreciation for this. A lot of the time I am mentally just not here at all. Most days I cannot stop feeling so shitty to the point where some days I will take 5 hour naps throughout the day just to avoid any shallow conversation with other people. I have tried going into things with a positive mindset, but I still just felt distant. Any advice?","lonely Despite having great family that thinks the world of me, I just feel so damn alone all the time."
"Martin Luther King Jr. And depression ""As my sufferings mounted I soon realized that there were two ways in which I could respond to my situation -- either to react with bitterness or seek to transform the suffering into a creative force. I decided to follow the latter course""- King JR. Today got me thinking..We need to figure out how we can turn our discontent, anxiety, anhedonia, insecurity, self hatred, and the meaninglessness that we all feel into real world change that we can see, touch , and feel proud of in a tangible form. We need to figure out as a community, how we can re-direct our negative feelings into helping others, and maby in the process we will be helping ourselves. I think alot of us feel meaningless, and have a hard time creating motivation to get us out of bed, besides our rare and far between moments of clarity. If we could find a way to re-direct our negative energy and encourage eachother to work towards causes we believe in, we could change the world while at the same time changing ourselves.At this point in my life, I have a ""good job"" and financial security, but I still experience horrible depression and that underlying feeling that im a failure and living a ""meaninglessness existence"". I have come to find that the only time I really feel ""alive"", or any feeling remotely resembling happiness is when I am either on drugs, or when I am helping people and making a difference. The latter of those two has actually improved my life, and I am hoping that as a depression community, we can motivate eachother to help re-direct our sadness to further causes that are meaningful to us, and hopefully squash our cynicism.

"19 years old and already miserable i just need to vent about how lost i feel in life. i have no dreams or ambitions about what i want to do as a career in my life, i have a job now which i suck at even though i basically only help my boss a few times out of the day and i only get about one shift every two weeks. i suck at driving even though its been a couple of months of constant driving practice trying to get my license. i have had girls interested me in the past but not for a long time even though i always manage to fuck it up anyway because im so socially awkward and i honestly feel like im going to be alone for life because i cant make a connection with any girl on earth. I feel like im losing my close friends even though we were all so close about a year ago. I already feel like a disappointment to my parents and i just want to lay in bed and listen to music all day everyday. Please tell this isnt how life is supposed to be, i feel like anxiety and this recurring sadness has taken control over me.",i have had girls interested me in the past but not for a long time even though i always manage to fuck it up anyway because im so socially awkward and i honestly feel like im going to be alone for life because i cant make a connection with any girl on earth.
"[F17] I really need someone to listen This is a throw-away, because I do not want anyone in my personal life to see this. Let me preface this by saying I have been diagnosed with bipolar tendencies (i guess you cannot diagnose bipolar disorder until you are 18), severe depression, chronic anxiety and body dysmorphia. I have been hospitalized for a suicide attempt almost two years ago, and I have struggled with self harm since fourth grade. I was bullied relentlessly throughout elementary and middle school. Thankfully, i have been clean for a year, and after the hospital I got on medication and things started to get better for a while. My senior year has been great so far but it is starting to get bad again. I used to be a social smoker, but now I am completely dependent on marijuana for everything. I am not hungry unless I smoke and I cannot fall asleep unless I smoke. I need it to get through the day. I cannot go to college, because I cannot afford it and my mom says she cannot consign on a loan for me. I totally understand that too, because if my dad were to die she would be in trouble and in tens of thousands of dollars in debt. I am just sad because I want to go away like all of my friends but I cannot. My dad is most likely going to lose his job soon apparently too, which is going to put us in poverty. My mom and dad fight all the time, and hate each other. They have both talked about getting a divorce to me exclusively. I pretend like it does not bother me, but it does. My dad is addicted to prescription painkillers, and locks himself in his room the minute he gets home. He comes to my choir concerts, plays, and musicals but leaves almost immediately after it starts, which hurts me a lot. I pretend like I do not care about that either. The thing that hurts me the most now is my dog was put down today. She was my first dog. I was allergic to dogs when I was way younger. I grew out of it and it took so long to find her, because my mom was set on picking the perfect dog for us. We found her, and now she is gone. I was the one who stayed in the room with her, because my mom could not do it. I pet and comforted her while she died. I have never had to cope with someone dying before, and it is so hard. She was just a dog, but I still loved her so much. I want her back so bad. My problems are so minor compared to some people is, but I am so sad right now. I do not know what to do. This is the first time in a while that I have wanted to kill myself, but I do not want to go down that road again. I just do not know how to cope anymore.","I am just sad because I want to go away like all of my friends but I cannot.

"My Boyfriend Talks Daily About Suicide -- Wo not Go To Hospital Hi guys, I am really just at a loss for what to do. I am absolutely gutted. My boyfriend has pretty serious depression and is in dire need of help. I will not be able to get him in to see a therapist until next week. He has recently become quite down on his luck and he hates himself for it. His anxiety stopped him from going to work, and he was fired. He has a new job now, but he hates it as it is a factory job where he works 60 hrs/week. Any time I try to help him find a new job so he can leave this job, he completely panics and shuts down and I cannot say anything or else he yells. It has gotten so bad recently that I dread waking up in the morning because of the psychological warfare with him. He will do things like saying he wants to self-harm, or he is going to jump out of the car while I am driving. I have been with him for years, through thick and thin. I have had to bring him to the hospital before, and he did get better for a few months. He told me tonight he does not want me to pick him up from work, and that he was not going to come home. At this point I feel completely lost, and I know calling the police will not help. I feel trapped and I need to get out for my own health, but I am deathly terrified he is going to kill himself if I leave. He told me I am the only thing holding him back from killing himself. I am scared. He is such a good person when he is not feeling this constant depression. I do not know how to get him to understand we just want to help him. He shuts me down every single day, and it hurts knowing he has given up on himself. What can I do to help him until he can see his therapist next week? I want to leave but I am so scared he will kill himself if I do.","Any time I try to help him find a new job so he can leave this job, he completely panics and shuts down and I cannot say anything or else he yells.

"Finally got a job, but do not really care. So, finally after about 10-11 months, I got a job. The job is not a bad one. Quite the opposite, actually. They specifically hired me saying that they were not looking for someone to just stick for a year and move on; they wanted to hire someone and essentially keep them/train them eventually up to management level in the course of hopefully a year or two depending how well I take it. I said yes.. though, mostly out of seizing a good opportunity. I am not happy, or excited. I just do not care, really. &amp;nbsp; First and foremost, I am a minimalist. The urgency of ""I need to save and buy a house"", or ""I need a secure career/future"", etc.. is non-existent in my life. Everything I own could fit in a van, and there would still be space left. I am not exaggerating. I have even contemplated living in one; build some insulation to the walls, lay out some flooring, and call it home. I would be absolutely 100% comfortable. Anyway~ My point is I actually have no reason to be taking this opportunity. The only thing that really ran through my head was ""I will probably kick myself in the ass in the future for not taking this"". Considering this is a job that will eventually lead to a solid annual salary within essentially no time, and requires no degrees or fancy stuff, it was kinda hard to say no. But it was also kinda hard to say yes. I do not have an endgame. I do not have a goal. At best, the closest thing to a goal that came to mind was ""Eh, I would probably get back into riding, and buy myself a motorcycle or something"". That was it. My mind literally blanks after that. Nothing else is there. &amp;nbsp; I am not suicidal. I do not go to sleep hoping that I will never wake up again (though I would not be upset by it), and I do not wake up upset that I am alive for another day in life. If I had to describe how I feel right now.. Everything is in a very, very quiet limbo. It is a very passive depression. &amp;nbsp; The best way I can summarize it is that this world has so much ""noise"", and it is exhausting for me. I get exhausted just from thinking about it. I wish people could just relax, and stop stirring so much motion around. It is always been like this for my entire life. I am so tired. Everything/everyone has to move around with such haste, but all I want to do is stop. I just want to appreciate the colors. I want to laugh. I want to be happy. But in this world, you * cannot* be happy looking at the colors. &amp;nbsp; *You just.. cannot.*","Finally got a job, but do not really care.

"Just venting Not sure the general gist of where this post is going but I just kind of want to write down my thoughts. I tend to feel better after I do so. Maybe along with that I can have the added bonus of affecting somebody else in a positive way with what I say or that someone else understands what I am saying. I am alone as I type this. I am sure many people who frequent this sub would describe themselves in that way. I feel over the years I have been getting more and more depressed. I was depressed when in my teens then I hit a lull in my 20s where I just did not care about much and put things out of mind. Now, I seem to be at a combination of both. A kind of dead, feel nothing type of feeling mixed in with depression. I have been getting angrier as well. Bitter and resentful. I feel like when I was a teen I just thought strongly that I was not very great in the general sense. I feel like I now know that to be true. After enough life experience and enough time with yourself you start to see who and what you are. Needless to say I do not like who I am. Maybe you do not either. I am not as strong, wise, caring, compassionate, friendly, hard-working, courageous, generous, et fuckin cetera that I would like. ""Well, why do not you change?"" Cause I clearly do not fuckin want to. Maybe I enjoy being depressed? Because obviously I have laid out terms, so to speak, for me to be depressed. Not courageous, hard enough working, kind etc etc. Yet, I do not do shit about it. So why complain as if I am depressed because of it? I think that is where the day to day numb feeling comes in. It is like ""I am this way. I do not like being this way. I do not change being this way. Why tf are you even upset?"" I really do not feel I deserve what I have in my life. Like the organ donor program I feel I would want to give my body to someone else. Maybe they can make better use of my fully functional legs. My vision. Ever see those people do an absolute fuck ton of things with their life? Those people who are so driven to accomplish a b c d e f g.. Every day of their life and they only have 1 limb? Are blind? Live in abject poverty? I have NONE of these fucking hurdles. I, in fact, do not have anything anyone would legitimately call a hurdle in life and yet I feel depressed. It is probably justified that I feel this way. I do not do anything to try and feel better and I do not capitalize on advantages I have in my life to make things better. To grow as a person. I do not do that for myself let alone for other people. And yet I want to have success.. I want to have profound love. Meaning and purpose. What a joke Just wish I could hit the fast forward button on this shit and get through with it. Oh right.. There is suicide. But even that holds it is own unique stigma to it. Next to no one would recommend you do that. It is not an ideal solution. So on and so forth. But you kind of have to admit that those that do go through with it.. It is as if you cannot question them. You cannot question their pain. Ca not question their sense of guilt or anguish or depression and sadness. They solidified it and made it real moreso than practically anyone could ever do when alive. Sometimes I wonder if those that commit suicide do so because it is either a) the only perceived way out of their grief or b) that it effectively proves to others beyond a shadow of a doubt what kind of hell they had been living through in the years leading up to doing it. You can never question someone who killed themselves as to whether their pain was real. Not just in the sense that they are no longer around to ask but that no one would ask what everyone inherently knows. Of course they felt pain. I feel that might be suicides greatest allure. It effectively puts a stamp on your sadness as legitimate. I have thought about it a lot throughout my life. I do not think I would ever have the stones to do it. Maybe my life or state of mind just is not that bad. Not yet anyways.

"Whatever happened to Doctor - patient confidentiality?? I applied for short term disability because depression is affecting my job and I am barely function - able at work. The insurance company made me sign a waiver of privacy to both my therapist and psychiatrist. Now they can call them up and ask anything they want!! The insurance company called me yesterday for a telephone ""interview""! They wanted me to explain why I needed the time off, what my symptoms are, how long have I been like this, really personal questions .. They are going to be the ones who determine whether I can get disability pay or not! Whatever happened to just taking the word of the doctor?? I wonder who the insurance company can tell? I forgot to ask them if this is going to be kept confidential. They also asked how this is affecting my job, I felt if I gave the ""wrong"" answer, they will decide not to pay me. I wonder what they are going to ask my shrinks, and how much info the shrinks can give them. Also, I understand that the shrinks / therapists can break the confidentiality rule if you threaten to hurt yourself or another -- that I can understand, but if you are ever on trial for something they can subpoena the doctors and they have to tell ALL! That is ridiculous! What happens if I am just a witness to some crime, but did not do the crime. What happens if the lawyers want to discredit me so they put my shrink on the stand to ask what a nut I am?

"I am 20 year old female. I have been on numerous antidepressant and anxiety medicine since I was 11 years old. I never had a problem with sexual dysfunction because 1) I had never been in a serious relationship, 2) I had never been sexual with someone. Now that I am in a sexual, serious relationship, I am having problems. I believe this is a result of Lexapro. I have never had a problem orgasming (at least not to this extent) and I have been on Zoloft, Prozac, you name it, etc. (These medicines were changed because they were either making me too drowsy or simply were not working). During the summer, I was only on Wellbutrin and had no problem orgasming. However, due to overwhelming anxiety during the start of the school year, I started taking Lexparo and continued the Wellbutrin. Ever since I added Lexapro, I have had an EXTREMELY delayed orgasm, or no orgasm at all. It is really frustrating. My doctor suggested switching medicine, but since Lexapro is working so well for me as far as anxiety goes, I said I would rather not. I cannot lower my dose because I am on the starting dose for both Wellbutrin and Lexapro. He said I could switch to Effexor or another SSRI medicine, but I may have the same sexual dysfunction. I was just wondering if anyone here has had a successful combination of Wellbutrin plus an anxiety medication that did not cause such extreme sexual dysfunction.","I never had a problem with sexual dysfunction because 1) I had never been in a serious relationship, 2) I had never been sexual with someone.

I fall hard. The wind is keeping me pushed down as I lay flat on my back and watch the storm go by, its cold, dark and rainy. People close to me are pushed out and a large glass cup is placed over me. They cannot see I am struggling and if they do they cannot get in. How long is the storm going to stay this time? I am not sure. The sad thoughts are like my safety blanket. Whenever things feel okay the thoughts come over and hug me tight. I am constantly depressed.

"My Story - There is hope. **TRIGGER WARNING - includes graphic language.** Hi there, first time posting. I see a lot of posts from high school/college aged people, and being through that myself, all I want to do is reach out and hug them and tell them how special they are. Instead of writing all the typical stuff ""you are so young,"" ""you will grow out of it,"" ""go see a therapist/take medication,"" etc., I thought I would share how depression affected me mentally &amp; emotionally and my journey through college. I got to the point where depression was life threatening, and I had given up all hope. I was lucky because my mom (and my dad) were 100% committed to my recovery, even if it meant I deeply hated and resented them at the time. I realize not everyone has that, but in sharing my story, I hope that maybe certain aspects can resonate with people going through the same thing I did and help them not feel so alone. **How Depression Affected Me**\- trigger warning It finds a way to connect to memories. To healthy feelings. And twist them into something dark. It craves uncertainty and pain and tells you that you deserve only that. It makes you seek out the deepest crevices of your mind and get lost. To the point where you do not even know what is you and what is the sickness anymore. It almost feels good to indulge because it is so familiar. We are taught that enduring pain is somehow one of the most beautiful things a person can do. But what if that pain is not real? In college, I was so afraid of being alone that I would not want guys to leave my room. And there were a fair amount of them. I would beg them to stay longer and tell them I had separation anxiety. As long as I was focusing on them, I did not have to focus on me. I justified it by saying that I was 'enjoying' my college experience and 'exploring' my sexuality. I thought it was normal to not see color, to not ever be excited, to want to drink until my body was as numb as my mind. I wondered how other people could live life with relative stability and thought I was weak for not knowing what they knew. To me, it seemed like common knowledge that life was pointless and ultimately a waste of time. I did not understand why I was the only one that could not cope with that fact. When I was home over a break, I told my mom that I had accepted I would never be happy. When my mom said she was hurt by that, it did not even occur to me why. I thought I had learned the secret that everyone else knew, the secret that let them go to class or work or see friends or make friends. Even though by the end of my freshman year, I was cutting myself and promiscuous and drank with the purpose of blacking out so I could have even just an hour of relief from myself, I could not admit that I had depression. I thought I felt and acted like that because I was lazy, stupid, slutty, weak. Every semester, my grades slipped a little (or a lot) at a time, and my parents grew more and more disappointed in me. I had been a star student in elementary school, frequently getting the highest scores in class and got into every top middle &amp; high school. I felt like such a failure. At this point, my parents sent me to a very expensive therapist, which ultimately was a waste of money because all I did was bend the truth to hide every aspect of myself and life. I do not think I could have even been honest even if I wanted to at this point. The first semester of my junior year, these thoughts grew too heavy. I did not want to be there anymore. I wanted to be nowhere, not awake, not asleep, not alive, not dead. I spent my time with people that encouraged all my doubts, and I pushed away people that cared. I rarely went to class and even if I did, I scraped by on the assignments. I lived for the moments of escape when I could go to parties and drink and hook up with guys, no matter how repelled I was by them. Outside of those few hours of escape, I could not sleep. I never went to the cafeteria with friends or even to get a real meal. I only ate Lean Cuisines that my parents had bought me at the beginning of the year. When I ran out, I ate solely Pizza Rolls and peanut M&amp;Ms. I did not do laundry once in those few months and barely took showers. The only time I put any effort into my personal appearance was when I went to a party because all I wanted was to be perceived as ""carefree"" and ""sexy,"" not the lazy slob that I thought I was. Even then, I wore wildly inappropriate clothing compared to what everyone else at my college wore - one time a girl yelled out to me, ""You are going to get raped!"" Another said judgmentally to a friend, ""She is not wearing pants."" (I was wearing sequined booty shorts, okay). My only happy moments that semester were with a boy that then tried to sexually assault me with a visiting alumnus. His excuse was that he wanted to get into the alumnus' frat by impressing that brother. When he tried to apologize the next morning, I told him he should not apologize. I was so disconnected from my body, I did not even view it as mine anymore. After that, I did not blame him and still spent most of my 'free' time with him. (Free meaning when I was not laying on my bed trying to gather enough strength to even leave my room, going to a party or the rare occasion I went to class or very very rarely attended a sorority event.) My last night at that school, my theory that I had borderline personality disorder was weighing on me. I had been thinking about it for a couple of weeks after I had finally figured out that my behavior and thoughts were not the typical college experience, thanks to my extremely honest roommate &amp; sorority sister. She told me that other girls in the sorority thought I was trying to ""fuck with their guy friends"" and slept with too many people. I tried to go to the student health center earlier that day. When I stated, ""I think I have borderline personality disorder,"" they just said, ""What do you want us to do?"" The only action they were equipped to take was to call the on-duty counselor who had to drive 40 minutes to get to campus. When I told her about my self harm and drinking and promiscuity she replied, ""How does that make you different than any other student?"" This further cemented my past notion that I was just weak: the numbness and loneliness - the desire to feel anything at all - was normal, and I just had a huge character flaw by not having the strength to be 'normal.' That night I got wasted and tried to swallow a whole bottle of caffeine pills at my friend is house. My intention was to induce a heart attack. He was one of the only people that I knew understood what I was feeling, but I never got a chance to tell him how close to the edge I was since his freshman girlfriend and two of her friends were with him that night. Not that it was his responsibility, but I just wanted confirmation that something was not right with me. While I was at his house, I tried to stay true to my 'carefree,' 'fun' person that I tried so hard portray while his girlfriend and her friends complimented my shirt and hair. It made me feel like such a fraud. Towards the end of the night, after I had swallowed those pills, my friend tried to get me to throw them up and then drove me to my dorm where I could not even find my room. I stumbled around and ran into the RA that had just gotten out of the shower and clung to him. I was scared and confused and felt so alone. I eventually got to my room and started cutting my already scarred wrist with baby scissors. I tried to cut into my femoral artery with those scissors as well, which was entirely unsuccessful. I settled for cutting my knee. At that moment, campus safety knocked on the door. I kept calm when they asked their usual questions, ""Have you been drinking tonight?,"" etc., until they asked me to show them my wrists. That is when I panicked. Started screaming and crying uncontrollably. They escorted me to their office. I later learned one of the officers asked my roommate if I slept around. While I was incoherently yelling, an officer handed me a phone. It was my mom, and I cried that a death of a young man I knew in high school was my fault, and that I could have done something. (Background: His death was not my fault in any conceivable way. He OD'ed. I barely knew him &amp; did not even know he was an addict, but I had a huge crush on him at the time and never acted on it. Through my warped logic, if I had been braver and talked to him, I could have isaved' him.) The next day she was at my school ready to pick me up. She had flown on the next available flight to get to me. When I returned home, I went through months of therapy and psychiatry and yoga and meditation all arranged all by my mom. In the beginning, I was okay. Broken down and exhausted but seemingly on the mend. On some level, I was relieved that I had finally been diagnosed with something (went from depression to bipolar II to a depressive mood disorder). I worked really hard with my therapist to understand my guilt, disgust and trauma, which ironically had been entirely driven by ways I tried to cope with my depression. However, fully expecting to go back to college for the next semester, I was informed that I was not allowed to return yet. When I chose to leave in the middle of the semester, the dean did not share the information that they had never let a student return from health leave until after six months of treatment. I had withdrawn from all my classes and sacrificed a semester is worth of my parents money thinking that I would be returning shortly and only a semester behind. After that initial blow, my parents eventually gave me more freedom, I met and got involved with a guy that got me more into substances. He was going through issues of his own, which is why I connected with him. One morning, my parents tried to wake me up but could not. No need to go into further detail, but it was one step forward and two steps back (I no longer wanted to be 'nowhere' but was now using.. alcohol.. frequently). Despite alcohol being one of my main coping mechanisms, I was fortunate not to develop any dependencies or addictions. A handful of months later, after my parents had taken away my phone and forced me to be supervised by them every night, I was accepted into a local university. I had also found a new therapist and psychiatrist. Their words stuck to me: 1) ""Depression sucks and it most likely will be with you forever but there are ways of treating it."" and 2) ""You get to a point in your recovery where you cannot blame your depression anymore. You just have to stand up and do your homework/go to your job/go to class."" I was also lucky enough to have a couple professors that understood on a basic level what I was going through. One told me to show up to class no matter how miserable I was. I did not bother to explain that depression was not about being miserable, but from there on out I did everything within my emotional power to go to class, even if I had drank before (that happened a couple times) or did not participate (happened almost every time). I ended up getting a C or D in the class, but I take that as a win since I easily could have failed. Another professor asked student services to reach out to me after I had not shown up to class a couple weeks in a row. I learned there will be a lot of people that do not get it and do not want to get it, but the one or two that do make all the difference in the world. Throughout my time at the new university, there were a lot of ups (meeting a close friend and actually making personal connections with people, excelling at the courses in my major) and downs (failing multiple classes and having to proactively withdraw due to ispecial circumstances,' finishing an entire bottle of wine in an hour, crying and writing gibberish about how guilty I felt then inviting some random 30 year old I had met on Tinder over to my dorm room), but slowly I was piecing it together. I eventually got an on-campus job, then a full time internship then a full-time job. While I am not perfect these days, I have been at a job I never would have dreamed of for the past two and half years and have gotten a promotion. Still, sometimes when the depression gets the best of me, I think that is who I really am. This broken, beaten down person that is ashamed of basically her entire young adulthood. I fear that I do not want anything of substance. That I cannot find anything of substance. That I do not even know what I want. No path. No passion. When it gets that bad, it takes every ounce of strength I have to fight it. Even on good days, I can feel like it is in the back my mind. I am terrified that it will come back, and I will not be able to control it. I will give in to the thoughts that say I am not good enough. You will never be good enough. Everything you have dared to want will slip through your fingers, and you will not even know. All I do is think about how far I have come from that girl who swallowed a dozen caffeine pills. That girl who thought she would never be happy. And it gives me just enough strength to deny those feelings and smile. I hope this was not too personal, but I wanted to be as raw and honest as possible. Thanks.","I see a lot of posts from high school/college aged people, and being through that myself, all I want to do is reach out and hug them and tell them how special they are.
Instead of writing all the typical stuff ""you are so young,"" ""you will grow out of it,"" ""go see a therapist/take medication,"" etc., I thought I would share how depression affected me mentally &amp; emotionally and my journey through college.
In college, I was so afraid of being alone that I would not want guys to leave my room.
I thought it was normal to not see color, to not ever be excited, to want to drink until my body was as numb as my mind.
I thought I had learned the secret that everyone else knew, the secret that let them go to class or work or see friends or make friends.
I had been a star student in elementary school, frequently getting the highest scores in class and got into every top middle &amp; high school.
I do not think I could have even been honest even if I wanted to at this point.
I did not want to be there anymore.
The only time I put any effort into my personal appearance was when I went to a party because all I wanted was to be perceived as ""carefree"" and ""sexy,"" not the lazy slob that I thought I was.
Even then, I wore wildly inappropriate clothing compared to what everyone else at my college wore - one time a girl yelled out to me, ""You are going to get raped!"" Another said judgmentally to a friend, ""She is not wearing pants."" (I was wearing sequined booty shorts, okay).
(Free meaning when I was not laying on my bed trying to gather enough strength to even leave my room, going to a party or the rare occasion I went to class or very very rarely attended a sorority event.) My last night at that school, my theory that I had borderline personality disorder was weighing on me.
I had been thinking about it for a couple of weeks after I had finally figured out that my behavior and thoughts were not the typical college experience, thanks to my extremely honest roommate &amp; sorority sister.
She told me that other girls in the sorority thought I was trying to ""fuck with their guy friends"" and slept with too many people.
When I stated, ""I think I have borderline personality disorder,"" they just said, ""What do you want us to do?"" The only action they were equipped to take was to call the on-duty counselor who had to drive 40 minutes to get to campus.

"Lost and Alone Hi, I am 19 and I am at my low point. Up until last year my life was pretty good, but now everything has fallen apart and I have no clue where to start picking up the pieces.. I will keep it short, but I found out my parents were getting divorced when I came home from college on spring break. I do not have a lot of friends and no close friends to confide in. The only people I do talk to are leaving for college soon (I am staying home now) and the only thing I had left was my girlfriend who cheated on me.

"I wanted to kill myself tonight. I am not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I have had a very rough few weeks with finding myself jobless, financially struggling and fighting with my boyfriend that I decided to write this little note in my phone. (The ending is supposed to sound funny, it was the only thing that made me laugh and give me that final push thought of pulling myself out of this horrible hole I was in tonight) Tonight, under a drunken wine induced depression, followed by the realization that someone I trust had betrayed it and lack of anti depressants, i seriously considered slitting my wrists in the bathroom. While sobbing with my hands in my face, trying to figure out who would take care of my son and my unpaid debt, I looked up to see my cat staring at me. She has this stern, mothering expression in her eyes, and we locked eyes for the longest time. She kept my gaze until my sobbing was under control and I really thought about my actions. Maybe she just wanted wet food. I am really bad at remembering to take my meds, and usually the day or two where I forget does not have this effect on me, but for the pile of emotional shit dealt to me the last week or so, apparently it did. I have not felt suicidal in years and I just need someone to understand where I am coming from.",I wanted to kill myself tonight.

We are all in this world to eventually die. I want out.

Why is this the only way and the only time i can ever share my feeling? Why am i depressed? Do you want to know? .. because i got raped and abused for 8 years. because i had my childhood taken away from me by a person that i trusted my life with, by the person that i called my father. My step dad raped me for 8 years, since i was 8 years old until a few months ago. Why did not i tell anyone? why could not i speak up? .. because he told me they would not believe me, it would ruin the family. my mom would hate me. well he was right about one thing it did ruin the family, but they did believe me and my mom still loves me. it ruined the family for a better cause. i do not ever have to see or talk to my step dad ever again. so why do i still feel this way?. .. because my mom still loves him, she is torn between us and she never really took my side and helped me through this. For 8 years of my life i had to pretend to be happy and normal. i had to push everything in the back off my mind and cry every night. i had to wonder why he was doing this to me, i thought he loved me. He had been my father since i was 2. how could he betray me like this and hurt me. how could he take away my childhood. from that i learned that in the end everything will be bad and nothing is ever what it seems. I had to grow up so fast, i had to realize how the world really was. i had to lie and keep secrets. I learned to hide everything even myself, even my soul. It took me 8 years of pain and suffering. of growing, thinking and knowing. of wishing, hoping and dreaming. to finally speak up. To finally show myself. to make my soul vulnerable. To cry a million tears that i could never cry before. but now that i can be me and show myself, i do not like myself. All the pain and misery. the secrets and lies. the memories and nightmares. this all was building up inside of me for 8 years. Now its showing and I am a bitter and sad person. I was on the verge of exploding and now its taking me along time to get all this build up out of me. I have never really discovered who i really am. I pretended for 8 years and now all the hurt and bitterness is showing. When and if that is all gone what will i really be like? i cannot even picture myself being happy or excited. I cannot picture my self in color when everything around me including me is gray and bleak. Will anyone ever love me?

"I always feel like I will never achieve my dreams and I am a failure. I have a big dream where I want to help people in those poor countries and volunteer in charity works. The issue that really concern me at the moment is child labor. I hate to see children working to earn money and live in poverty when they are supposed to learn and enjoy their childhood. Another dream of mine is to pursue in the post graduate program after finish my degree. That is very difficult for me as I need a good GPA to get the financial loan. I think I didnt do well in my study at the moment. I dont think I am able to continue my study in master program. I always hate myself because I feel like I lack a lot of thing. I have a social anxiety where I love being alone, I feel nervous when talking with someone else. I avoided my highschool friends because I think I cant fit well.

"I am 17 years old I live in the metro Detroit area and I have had depression for the past 5 years, my parents refuse to admit I have a problem, at one point I used to cut myself and at another point I was rushed to the ER to get my stomach pumped from trying to over dose. Basically I joined this forum so I can realize for myself I am not the only one with problems. My depression has gotten a lot better over the years as certain situations got better too; I have a loving boyfriend whom I have been with for 14 months now, which I am extremely sure that he has helped me. Next year, well in the fall I will be moving away to college, which I actually think will be a good thing for me. I am also a cheerleader at my school, which does not help with my depression I am constantly under pressure about that. I am also a dancer, my parents have this thing where they like to find every little thing I do wrong. It seems as if nothing I do is good enough or right. Which has lead to my wanting to be alone and not eating. With the stress of dance and cheerleading and my parents constantly telling me I am fat has lead me to only eat once or twice every other day. I know it is not healthy and I know it is not good, but I personally think its better then cutting and better then trying to overdose on pain killers and every other pill in the house. Thanks for listening.","I am 17 years old I live in the metro Detroit area and I have had depression for the past 5 years, my parents refuse to admit I have a problem, at one point I used to cut myself and at another point I was rushed to the ER to get my stomach pumped from trying to over dose.

"I know life is not easy but I never knew it would be this hard.. I feel empty and numb, but at the same time so sad and hurt.. My biggest struggle is with my family, the only person that is there for me is my Step Dad.. No one else seems to get it? My mum is always telling me to not keep secrets and that I should tell her how I feel coz if she does not know everything how can she help me? But I do not want to have to tell her everything (Because she says hurtful things back at me once I tell her and she will not even hug me) but if I do not tell her she makes me feel so bad and so I do tell her how I feel and then she shoots me down! She tells me to snap out of it and just get on with it and to stop being so stupid.. every time I talk to my mum I cry coz she hurts me so much! And then she gets all down coz she makes me down which makes me down!! I JUST CAN'T WIN! These days I only have to say something like ""oh that sucks, no milk"" and she tells me to get over it or get lost! And all I did was say something. I cannot even really explain it? It is like she will not be happy until she hears what she wants to hear.. I have tried talking to her about the way she makes me feel and all I get is ""that is just life"" or she starts telling me how she buys me things and that I should feel like this coz she has brought me things and let me use her car, etc, etc.. The other day I was haven a really bad day and I asked mum for a hug and all she could say is ""No.."" she says she does not want to feed my sadness BUT instead of doing happy things she just tells me to get over it! And she will not listen when I say stop..She even told me to pack my bags and leave once if I did not get over whatever it was I was going through! If I did not have my step dad I would not be here today.. I love him more than the world and he is the only one that shows me that he loves me.. I just need help..

"Emotionally offline I should not be writing this, I have three final projects due in the next couple of days and I have not started on any of them. But I do not have the energy to even get started..I do not know what to do. It is too late to ask for extensions but I do not want to fail my classes (that mean nothing to me). Whatever..I guess I will turn out fine because I was doing well grade-wise up to this point, but it is gonna be fucking painful. Over the course of the last couple of weeks, I feel as if I have gone emotionally offline. I feel like a shell of myself. I am not sure what happened. I think the real downturn started when I was walking on campus two weeks ago and saw my ex-girlfriend of a few months with her new boyfriend, but that is definitely not the only thing that is bothering me. It might have been a death-by-a-thousand-cuts situation because if I take an itinerary of what is going on in my life, there is not much there. If my life had a thesis statement, it would be that I have nothing to look forward to. Hardly any aspect of my life can bring me out of the apathy that I seem to be stuck in every day. I do not find any of my classes enjoyable, and now the thought of doing it as a career is starting to give me nightmares. I have friends but I do not much enjoy hanging out with them, and overall, any attempts to meet new people just seems to amount to nothing. I have no dating life, and I am still admittedly stuck on the aforementioned ex-girlfriend (who has completely moved on) that I dated for seven months and have been broken up for the same length. All I can think about is that if she saw me today, barely able to get out of bed and go to school, I am also certain she would feel even more justified in breaking up with me. I keep thinking about this new person she is dating and in what ways he is likely a complete upgrade. I do not even know what their situation is, I am just inventing scenarios in my head. I need to stop that. Fuck. The only thing I have is that I am in fairly good shape and my GPA is 3.8 (although that is certain to go down after this week, which scares the ever-living shit out of me because it feels like the only real thing I can put on my resume). I am also fairly consistent with working out; it is not a huge part of my life, but holy shit, if I did not do it I cannot imagine how depressed I would be. Right now, all of the emotional energy I have for the day goes to getting myself to the gym at the least. With my career, I am interested in how technology affects people and society; like internet addiction, social media, artificial intelligence, etc. That is kind of what drew me to my major in the first place, which is User Experience Design. However, I do little of that (the research side of things, which includes talking to people and learning their stories, then coming up with conclusions based on that data on how you can improve a digital service) and more the design/development side of things (like visual/graphic/UI design and web development, just building the fucking thing), which I am good with, but it both stresses me out and bores the shit out of me. I think it would be fulfilling to be a UX Researcher for a popular social app just because I would be able to study how people interact with it. Or do that for a consultancy/agency or something, and start a blog/podcast about technology+society. I kind of largely detest the Silicon Valley tech utopianism that is sweeping the country, it seems to be making everyone I know (and myself) unhappy in really subtle ways, but it is become almost a cult of sorts. I could turn what I learn about user research to that. But if I want to keep pursuing this path, I have to keep doing the parts that make me depressed (design and coding) for a significant amount of time so I have just kind of lost motivation to try at all. I know I should just push through, but I have pushed through my whole life and honestly, I am tired of fucking pushing. Everyone is telling me to keep moving forward because I show talent in it (the design/code side of user experience) and it is lucrative but fuck man I can only do this for so long. I would rather use my creativity on music or writing. I have three internship interviews this week which is not good to have hanging over my head when I am asking all of these questions. I constantly wonder if there is a better, more fulfilling, and less depressing route to the other side of all of this. The social life issue is more simple, I do not even want to write about it. I need to be more vulnerable to people and go outside my comfort zone, and that is gonna take a ton of work no matter how you spin it. The first part of this video with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem is basically my entire life in a nutshell: . Ditto on the dating life, although that might be a little more complicated. I have only even felt attracted to one person since my breakup, so I guess there is more going underneath the surface there. I cannot imagine dating anyone in my current state, but man, the ever-present loneliness really drains me. Is not it ironic though? I want to go into a career where I study people all day, yet I struggle to actually build and establish friendships. I am like a people is introvert, it makes no sense. I seem to use daydreaming and fantasizing as an escape. I spend an embarrassing amount of mental time each day imagining myself as a frontman for a successful band; I really look up to someone like Father John Misty, I feel we have similar sensibilities on a lot of things. And there is just something about pouring your emotions and thoughts into an album, performing it live and connecting with people through that authenticity, that really makes me regret not taking learning music seriously up until this point in my life. I could really use that sort of emotional release right now. Same with writing, when school is not consuming every moment of my waking day I like to read a lot, so I would like to write a book one day on something I care about. I am reading what I wrote and it is kind of frustrating. I clearly have dreams and desires, why cannot I manifest them into anything that makes me remotely proud of myself? Like am I even depressed? I feel like way too many people here have it worse than me for me to complain about my depression. Maybe I am just a shitty person looking for an excuse not to do anything useful with my life. I am just trying to make it to Friday. My favorite band is coming to my city and it is the only thing I am looking forward to. Its the only reason I am ignoring the thoughts of suicide..I need a break from all this bullshit. I am gonna schedule a doctor is appointment today to get a blood panel done to see if anything is happening there. I might look into SAD because depression always seems to historically hit me around this time (although this time last year was the happiest I have ever been, so I am not exactly sure). I already see a therapist weekly but I might look for a new one because I am not sure if we are making any progress. I am gonna try to get back into meditation if I can find any time. I just want to know when it is gonna get better.","I keep thinking about this new person she is dating and in what ways he is likely a complete upgrade.
The only thing I have is that I am in fairly good shape and my GPA is 3.8 (although that is certain to go down after this week, which scares the ever-living shit out of me because it feels like the only real thing I can put on my resume).
However, I do little of that (the research side of things, which includes talking to people and learning their stories, then coming up with conclusions based on that data on how you can improve a digital service) and more the design/development side of things (like visual/graphic/UI design and web development, just building the fucking thing), which I am good with, but it both stresses me out and bores the shit out of me.
But if I want to keep pursuing this path, I have to keep doing the parts that make me depressed (design and coding) for a significant amount of time so I have just kind of lost motivation to try at all.
I know I should just push through, but I have pushed through my whole life and honestly, I am tired of fucking pushing.
The social life issue is more simple, I do not even want to write about it.

Then when I was 13 my parents got divorce, and me and my sister decided to stay with dad. I met some awesome friends, the best people I ever met, but we are sorting out..

And I have to study for exames If want to do a college (is very hard in Brazil) but I do not know what I want to do, and I do not want live in Brazil anymore, but I need money to travel, even if I won a scholarship..

"I am actually feeling a little bit like a fraud at the moment, because I have read so many different topics today and realized that there are people who have suffered far more than I have. I have joined this site, to start to try and get some help for myself and to talk about the things that have caused me to feel like this over the last few years. My doctor has told me that I am depressed and prescribed tablets, but I refuse to believe this and have not taken them. I know that this is wrong, but I hate the idea of being labeled depressed. Before I went to university, I was happy, adventurous, nothing could keep me down. I was in a fantastic relationship, but then I moved into halls, in a flat with six others, who I absolutely adored. One of them in particular, who I fell in love with. Little did I know that he had also fallen for me in the same way, but we were both so shy and I was in a relationship, that neither of us did anything about it .. until we moved into a house together in our second year with 3 others. This is when everything went wrong. We were always close, really close in fact, and I admitted to him that I kept getting urges to kiss him, hold him and never let him go. He felt the same way as I did, but still nothing was done by either of us. Then one evening we were both out, getting drunk with friends, we found ourselves alone when we got back to the house and kissed. I have never felt like I did that night since. I did not care about anything around me. We were the only 2 people in the world at that moment. The next morning, we were both a bit bemused and did not know what to say / do, so pretended like nothing had happened. The end of term came and we had just moved in to another house with the same people, but were all going home for the summer. I was devastated knowing that we would not see each other until september. I began to resent my boyfriend who I was still with and my family were going through problems because of my father. When september came, I went straight onto my final teaching placement, which meant up at 530 work all day, home, eat ,work and then in bed by 11pm. I was tired all the time and did not have the energy to go out in the week, but He was always there for me, and yes, we were still pretending like nothing had happened. After the christmas of my final year, I decided to party like never before. It was great, but there was still the issue of him. By now I had been trying to convince myself that I was still in love with my boyfriend, purely because I did not have the guts to leave him and be on my own. How pathetic was that. Anyway, we went out to the union for a major drinking session, danced like a couple, felt like a couple, got back to the house and one thing led to another. We ended up sleeping together in his room, he initiated it. It was amazing. However the next day we were so confused that we did not speak for 2 days, until I told him how I really felt. That I had been in love with him since my first year, but could not do anything about it, that I was going mad inside because I wanted him so much. He returned my feelings. From then on, we were inseparable, but to anyone who saw us together, we were just 2 very very close friends, who lived in each others' pockets. We were having an affair of sorts and living a lie, but we found comfort in each other and could not let it go. I know how wrong it was, believe me I do, and I would be devastated if it ever happened to me. We left university in the june of 2004. It was the worst time of my life. I felt like I was losing part of me, and was never going to get it back. Before we left and before the lie really started, I had agreed to move in with my boyfriend in leeds for his final year. I did not want to do this anymore, but was too chicken to say no, so this went ahead and for the last year, july 04 until now, I have been living with my boyfriend. Things have not been good and I have still been seeing Him (from university) as often as I can. The most recent one was a couple of days ago. We have both joked about running away, children, marriage, but neither of us has got the guts to do anything. It is so wrong and has made my life so difficult, putting on a brave face for friends and family, pretending that I am happy all of the time. I do not think I can do it much longer. One last thing, while all of this was going on in my life, my dad was causing mayhem at home. I was being pushed and pulled between the 2 people that I thought could get through anything and that were truly in love. How wrong can you be. I was like a piece of meat being fought over by 2 animals. They constantly bitched about each other to me, leaving me with no - one to talk to. I found myself being dragged further and further down in to a pit which I cannot get out of. I am in love with Him, but will not leave my boyfriend for fear of being alone, I resent my father for what he has done, I resent my mother for being callous, there is no - one that I have told this to over the past 4 years, nobody who I felt that I could really trust. I do not know what to do anymore. I cry at the smallest thing, hate things changing at all, but most of all, I cannot see the point of going on anymore. I just want these feelings to end. My one savior has been my work, teaching children. caring for others and helping them make the most of their lives makes me feel like I am doing something worthwhile. I am not expecting any replies, I just needed someone / thing to listen.","I am actually feeling a little bit like a fraud at the moment, because I have read so many different topics today and realized that there are people who have suffered far more than I have.

"My hands will not do what I want them to. I know I know I have ranted about not being able to do anything artistic a thousand times now, but this is different. A few times I have forced myself to draw I was garbage, but I figured that is to be expected since I have not done it in a while. However lately I have found playing video games much more difficult because I find myself pressing the wrong button almost purposely, or not reacting to something my brain processed seconds ago. It is even gotten to the point where typing is difficult for me--every other letter I find myself making a stupid typo, and its irritating.

Everyone keeps telling me that I have to live for myself and not search for answers through others but I feel like I cannot help myself. I feel like no one around me understands what I am going through. I feel like a robot at work, forcing myself to seem okay.

I am okay but other is are not I make them feel helpless As they watch me sway Between okay and isolation. Isolation from others From myself From my passions.

Now that it is over, I feel worse off. I forgot what it feels like to not be crushed by depression and all the shitty things that come with it. The depression has seeped right back in and it hurts more now. I should be grateful I was able to escape it for a moment, but fuck no.

"I would love to talk about dreams. Only thing is for every dream, there can be a hundred interpretations. Or so has been my experience. I always say that I will keep paper and pen next to me at night, so when I have a dream I want to remember (like last night).. I will write it down so I will not forget. But I do not do this because when I wake up I think I can remember..no problem! After all, a lot of these dreams are so profound that how could I possibly forget them.. guess what?? I almost always forget the words that meant so much to me in the dream. I remember the subject matter, but it is the words many times that I want to remember. So here goes my dream from last night (or early this morning).. A little background first for those who do not know or remember who I am.. my mother died quite suddenly from her leukemia in April 2004. We were at odds with each other at the time. I started taking care of my elderly father at the time and he died this past August 2005. I have been wanting to dream about my mother and feel her presence and love since she died. I have only had a few dreams about her, maybe 4.. And they have all been upsetting, never ""nice feeling"" dreams. Last night I had a dream of my mother. She was pregnant and ready to deliver her baby. She looked younger (she was almost 82 at her death) but in the dream ""we"" knew she was older like she was alive today. She said ""I am ok now I am going to have a baby At least I think this is what she said. My dad was in my dream as was my dad is cousin, who is also deceased. My mother is cousin-in-law was in the dream and she was sobbing. This same woman was crying out of control at my mother is funeral. We were at a hotel in Disneyland. Ok everyone.

"Is it okay to be tired of pretending everything is okay to spark optimism? So I have alot going on in my life -- too much for me to want to spend five hours writing about it for this post. What is bothering me is that lately, things have been weighing down HARD. My patience is paper thin from years of abuse and I feel like in these last few months, I am receding into myself because I do not have patience for even reasonable flaws in other people. I am tired of being stepped on and dealing with the hand I have been dealt in life (I am CLAWING my way out of poverty ALONE, caused by a narcissistic parent kicking me out and attempting to kill me at 17 -- just made 21). I finally told my boyfriend today, not mincing any words, that I am so fucking tired of being optimistic. That I am tired of pretending anything is going to be fine because alot of the times I feel like it will not. ""Faking it till you make it"" has worked for me in the past, definitely, but being optimistic to KEEP myself from being depressing/depressed is not fucking working for me. It is idiotic. It is not that I think things are 100% pointless -- I am working on a set of skills right now to get myself out of my minimum wage job to get a much better one. &amp;nbsp; But I am just exhausted from trying to not worry other people and not expressing how fucking done I am with everything. Is this normal? Is this healthy? Like I said, not giving up. I am working forward. I just feel like the fake optimism is an extra step and a formality at this point and honestly complaining today made me feel better, not going to lie, as I do my best to not do that because I feel like I am ""pushing myself on others"" (my situation is so bleak that people almost never know what to say in response anyway because there is nothing close to an immediate solution). But I feel angry and spiteful that people who have been given everything or that can recieve assistance from family telling me how I have to ""perk up"" because It is ""what they do when things are hard"" when their ""hard"" is ""I stayed up all the time in college to study and it is hard"" vs ""I stay up all the time to study my new skillset AND risk my life every day on a chinese scooter that gives out at times to do deliveries in all of the elements to make a wage that is not even livable, having one or more panic attacks a day because of dangerous drivers"". &amp;nbsp; I also feel bad because my SO is always trying to be an optimist. He is somehow perfected this even being depressed himself. Sometimes that bleeds through but he is usually hyper optimistic and it is exhausting. We have gotten in arguments in the past when he was less acquainted with my depression because if I was not immediately cheered up by him making jokes while I am crying to make me laugh (let me work through my emotions, damn.. It works sometimes but not ALL the time, seriously), he would get insulted and take it personally that a single joke was not enough to change my outlook on life and fix all my issues. I feel kind of like I got a little snippy with him when I complained earlier and kept cutting him off and telling him how hopeless I felt and telling him, emotionlessly, ""I just do not care to be optimistic. I do not give a fuck. What is that going to do? I am already tired, it is just going to make me more tired"" because I had a feeling that that was where he was going to go with it. I feel bad because he is just trying to help. But I am so fucking tired. So tired. I have a hard time doing anything if I do not think it has a point (Even if I hate a job, I am still getting paid, and there is therefore a point to it) and I just did not see the point of doing all this. I think I do to make him happy and worry less about me. But I am so upset that I do not have the capacity right now to do more things to emotionally keep him comfortable. That is stupid. I feel bad, but that is stupid.","That I am tired of pretending anything is going to be fine because alot of the times I feel like it will not.

Nothing is enjoyable anymore. Almost everything that I used to care for is simply starting to have no meaning. I feel dead and lifeless.

"Help: ruining my University course Second year student here in a UK university. I hardly tried at all in the first year, got generally bad grades on my coursework, but revised just enough for the exams to get a 2:1, which is second from the best grade. I also had a few weeks of socialising separated by many weeks of pretty much self-imposed (and lack of sleep imposed) loneliness. So at the time I felt terrible, but looking back on it from second year I had some good memories. Now I am missing half the lectures, sometimes I do not even go to the shops to get food for the day and have a terrible diet, miss enormous amounts of sleep, and have not done any work at all. I am already failing, and even with resits I have to get a ridiculous mark on my tests this semester to even stand a chance of a worthy final score after the 3rd year is over. I feel like the only thing that is gonna bring me out of the depression is the pride of getting a good grade, but I am way too pessimistic right now to believe that deep down I can even do it. I am convinced that only 2 friends like me, 1 pities me, and their friends just mock me stealthily. Paid for societies but do not go to any.

"Does everyone else just hurt all the time It is not like physical pain or soreness, it is just this overwhelming feeling of exhaustion and numbness. Doing anything, from applying for jobs to walking my dog, is just so overwhelmingly exhausting and it feels like running a marathon. I have tried everything - exercise, diet, meditation, meds. Nothing is working. Exercise just makes me tired. I have never gotten that rush of endorphins. I do not have any hobbies that make me happy or that I can even focus on long enough to distract me.

"Stop and think for a moment It is like stumbling around in the darkness. You cannot see, you can only feel. Blinded by the pain of reality. You beg it to stop, as the throbbing in your heart grows stronger. But it is not gonna stop, no matter how hard you beg. Your so called 'friends' abandon You, because your depression talk has gotten too dark. But what is the worst part? That you cannot control it? That you cannot stop it? Maybe it is the fact that just maybe.. just maybe you do not want It to stop. You cling onto your pain, because after all..it is familiar. It is been with you for a while. You stand upon the dark edge, upon the highest edge you could find. You feel the wind blow in your face. You freeze. All the good moments, All the good people. It all comes in floods of part nostalgy and part regret. What took you to this edge? What made you so desperate, To take such drastic action?

"No one has a monopoly on suffering. We keep living our lives because depression is pain and illness is suffering, but both do not happen without something happening to us. It is at these times that we are changing in some way..Suffering can give us greater empathy and understanding. It can strip away all the other stuff. So many say they will always be depressed .. that may or may not be the case but everyone has right to live their lives .. suffering included. However, there is a vast difference between simply suffering from depression and finding the courage to live with long term / cyclical depression. You can, learn to live with depression. It may profoundly change your life .. take much away from you, but you can learn to live with it. Long term depression is not static .. like any illness, it changes. But we know depression is different because it so cruelly takes away our hope of a brighter future. But be stubborn and it will change again. To state in a forum like this, that you want to end it all is a big responsibility to place on the shoulders of other people. It hands the possibility of that personal choice on to others .. which is unfair. Genuine suffering can bring more empathy and awareness of the plight of others in similar situations. There are times when i feel like ending my life and the thoughts nudge at me constantly but I recognize them now for what they are: the depression talking. With each episode I have learnt new ways to try and tag these thoughts. Ultimately .. the illness is happening to me / the thoughts happen to me. But I would not burden others with the knowledge of their presence. It is only afterwards that i might mention that i had these constant thoughts, because to tell them in the middle of the depression would only darken their lives as much as the depression is darkening my own. Please think before you make threats of suicide in the chat room or forums. There is an increasing number of people using this technique of gaining attention but it is unfair. by all means we can talk about it .. but saying : ""i am going to do it."" is simply selfish and smacks of attention seeking. Such behavior is destroying the integrity of genuine sufferers of depression in the eyes of so many. It is eroding the help which is so lacking for so many .. and is probably the reason why the mental health hospital near me is a relic from the 60 is and yet the cancer department is brand new and state of the art. Please .. stop attention seeking and stop using ""depression"" as a convenient coat hanger for emotional immaturity and lack of personal responsibility. For so many people .. this really is a matter of life and death.","We keep living our lives because depression is pain and illness is suffering, but both do not happen without something happening to us.

"I found out I had depression about 10 years ago. But looking back I had it since i was a teen. I have tried suicide about 4 times. As you can see that did not work. I have 2 kids, one is 21 and the other is 14. I have been married for 11 years this year. They know I have depression, but it is my problem not theirs. I wake up every morning thinking about killing my self and I go to bed thinking about killing myself. I sit around and cry all day. I do not like to leave my house, and I do not unless I really have to. I am overweight, 39, and very alone in this world. My family tries to stay away from me, they do not talk to me unless they have to. My 14 year old is totally afraid of me, I can see it in her eyes. My 21 year old is bipolar, which makes him more screwed up than I am. He throws me into a panic attack every time I get around him. I have been on all of the medications out there, nothing seems to work for me. They just make me sleep a lot. I went to therapy for about 7 years. That really did not work either. I just started back last month. I hope it helps me this time.","I found out I had depression about 10 years ago.

"I Want to Scream Until It Stops and the World Makes Sense Again (update) A few good days had me fooled into thinking I had control over myself and my life.

"Alright, this is a bit weird to explain, but I am having a lot of trouble making this decision so I am going to try and write it down. If anyone has any suggestions or advice to offer I would appreciate it. A while back my brother and I let a stray cat in and fed it, and we got really attached to it. It is probably the most needy animal I have ever met and will sit with people all day, loves it when you pet it, and I really like the cat. I was not thinking at the time, but later I realized I needed to pay a pet deposit like the rest of the people in my complex, so I could keep the cat. So my mother called up our landlord is office and they said that we could not have the cat. It seems really unfair to me that everyone else is allowed animals, but for some reason we are not. I do not think there is anything I can do about this and it makes me really sad. We did not want to get rid of the cat so bad that we decided to hide the cat away, letting it inside only at night, and living in my brother is van in the day while we were looking to see if there was somewhere else we could move to. The problem is, I think I would only barely have enough money to move and I think it would be too risky that my family would lose our assistance if we were to go through with such a thing. Not to mention that I keep my spare money around in the case of emergencies and if something bad were to happen, I would not be able to deal with it financially. So the only option I know of that is left is the animal shelter and I really do not want my cat to be locked up and possibly die alone in a cage. I know that it is getting old and that people take younger cats from animal shelters much more often than older ones. I want my cat to have a good place to live and do not want it to spend its final years in a cage, without loving owners. I am having so much trouble making this decision.. I love my cat a lot and want it to be taken care of well and to be happy, but I am endangering my family the longer I try to hide it. My mother and brother keep telling me that it is my decision to make and I just keep procrastinating. So I posted this here because it is making me depressed and stressed out. Are there any options I am leaving out? Do I either have to spend all of my money to move or give it to an animal shelter? They both seem like such terrible options","It is probably the most needy animal I have ever met and will sit with people all day, loves it when you pet it, and I really like the cat.

"Hey, I guess this is the place to post this. I do not really know if I am depressed and if I am I am not sure how to go about getting help for it so I figured you guys would be able to help me out a bit. For the past year and a bit I have been feeling really out of sorts, pretty down and kind of lost in general. I left school in July 2004 and started a year out before I went to university. That is when I started feeling strange and I put it down to (and still believe it was) just a weird kind of feeling when one leaves school and their life changes forever and it is the beginning of being an adult which is a scary time for anyone. Over the year I would go through different stages where for a few months I would feel really positive and enjoy spending time with people and then for a few months I would feel lonely and sad and not go out with friends for months on end. Then I went to university in September 2005 and felt very very sad. I think it was the shock of leaving home, living away from everyone I would ever known and also the feeling of being back at school. I knew immediately that I would made a terrible decision starting university, it was not what I wanted to be doing with my life and for the 6 weeks I was there I would stay in bed pretty much all day and not eat much. I think I lost about a stone and a half and even now, 3 months after dropping out and moving back home I am still half a stone lighter than I was last summer. So now I am back at home and I have started a job cleaning tables in a cafe where I got on with the people I work with and I am back in the same city as my girlfriend again and things should be ok but I keep dropping into really low moods. A few weeks ago I thought that maybe it was depression and so I took some tests on the internet with what seem to be the basic questions. I tried to answer as truthfully as possible, you have to understand that depression is not something I want to have, I have known too many silly teenagers who think that having depression makes them interesting to other people and so they exaggerate emotions to try and look sad to find it appealing. So even though I found myself answering questions that I knew were making me seem depressed I answered the anyway because it was the truth. Things like a lowered libido, I find myself wanting to have sex with my girlfriend far far less frequently than I used to and to be honest a lot of the time when I am having sex I feel that I am just going through the motions. My sleeping which has always been a little odd has become increasingly erratic and I have found myself thinking about death a lot. To be honest though I thought that everyone thought about death and dying and that it was natural. I fin myself becoming very easily bored with people and situations and where I once used to enjoy writing stories I cannot being myself to do it anymore. The worst thing though is the mood swings I have and the low moods I find myself in quite frequently. When I feel like this I do not want to be around anyone or have anyone talk to me and I cannot stop myself thinking about bad things that have happened to me or could happen on a personal level and making myself the centre of blame for them. So am I depressed or is it just, as I am leaning towards, a natural part of growing up and finding myself in the world of work and adulthood and trying to adjust to it. And if I am depressed how do I stop myself being this way? The thought of going to my doctor and sitting there and saying ""I think I am depressed"" does not make much sense to me. I have always thought that with problems of that nature you must be told that you are ill and not decide for yourself that you are. Sorry if this has been very long and poorly punctuated, I wrote it all fairly stream of consciously. Any help at all would be very much appreciated, I am feeling pretty vulnerable and down right now and do not want to feel this way anymore.","I think it was the shock of leaving home, living away from everyone I would ever known and also the feeling of being back at school.

"Hi everyone. My name is Charlie and I have suffered from occasional bouts of depression for a while. Something that has recently taken my interest is the inferiority complex and how this affected my perceptions of things. I first got onto the idea through a page called Depression Hurts at a Hypnosis site 121 hypnosis (its worth plugging as I have found it useful). It took a while to admit to myself that I was afraid of not belonging, being criticized, sarcastic remarks at work etc and it stems back to horrid teachers and kids at school. This has been a turning point for me though - working through the false learnings and memories, so I thought I would share it in case it resonates with anyone else. I have since recognized symptoms of inferiority in others (and they vary widely from conceited arrogance to total withdrawal), and it is been really great.",My name is Charlie and I have suffered from occasional bouts of depression for a while.

"Weekends are the worst There is nothing to distract myself on the weekends. I did spend time with friends Friday and Saturday, but the majority of the time I just sit at home and watch youtube or do some other dumb shit. I have been trying to quit drinking and smoking weed, but they really numbed the weekend away to make it bearable. Now I am just a sad sap with nothing to do. I am trying to take up hobbies to fill the time but it seems pointless. The worst part is that I have had some really good days this week and I thought that maybe I was better. The depression is worse after I have felt genuinely happy for the first time in a long time. I have been overwhelmed with cravings for alcohol all weekend and I have been trying to get some homework done, but all I can focus on is wanting to drink. Maybe I should just get drunk to make them go away for a while.","I have been trying to quit drinking and smoking weed, but they really numbed the weekend away to make it bearable."

"I cannot do school work and I have no will power left The past two years I have been having a mental battle with myself trying to do my work just to come out with bad grades and disappointment from myself and my parents.

I know my parents just want the best for me but they cannot help me. Even when I am in class it takes all my mental strength to do the simplest things like take notes. The most frustrating part is that nobody thinks I try to do anything. Everyone treats me like a complete dumbass because I cannot do my work.

"I am a 23 yr old university student and I think I am getting depressed again. One of the debates I am having with myself is whether or not this is really depression. I was diagnosed with it about 2 years or so ago (although it was not my first bout of feeling low) and was put on a high dosage of medications (which I took). Things got better after a few months and so of course I stopped taking them cold turkey. Obviously not the best idea in the world, aside from this being one of the worst things to do because of the possibility of reoccurrence, my body went through heck and I had some pretty nasty side effects (even worse than when I was actually taking the meds). Fortunately, it did not reoccur and I have been feeling fine until the past couple of months. I think I am feeling the warning signs again: low energy, crying, circular thinking, apathy towards everything, skipping school, sleeping all day, anxiety .. I just feel like maybe this is not really depression, maybe I am just a person who does not handle stress well. Jeeze, when I read this it sounds so ridiculous. Part of me knows I am being illogical but another part is just blaming me for being weak and not being able to just sit back and enjoy life. Why cannot I just be happy? Why do I have to be so moody? Why am I so weak? It is stupid but I keep blaming myself. I do not think I am bipolar since I have never experienced real highs but every couple of years or so my lows get really low. Last time was by far the worst and I would not have been able to get through it without medications and I do not want it to get to that point again but .. I guess I still feel a lot of shame about it. It still feels like depression is being weak. I know, I know it is just like having diabetes and your body needs the chemicals to be normal but *sigh* I still blame myself. Last time I told my teachers and some friends and it is like they look at me as if I am contagious or insane. I do not know if I can go through that again.

"Well, I guess, i mean i know I need help. I lost my husband . he died of a heart attack at 56 on his walk home from a police station from being arrested for soliciting a prostitute., two years ago, cannot get over it. It was a bad scene, we were not great lovers or anything like that, more like companions, he cheated on me a lot and i just accepted it, but we did things together, ate out a lot, went to flea markets, he was nice to me, he loved me , he was just stupid, and i would not have sex with him because of his indiscretion, I think he understood that.

He put me on lots of medications, it cost a lot of money, I was still depressed somewhat and really, I do not think he understood me at all.

I tried to get him to get a job and it just turns into a yelling crying i am going to through you out of the house thing .. He is my child, I will not throw him out , .. oh, he also has adult ADD. I have a real hard time socializing because i have low self esteem, I am fat, 53 years old, not very attractive, and on and on. When I try to improve myself, I get frustrated, the weight , .. etc. I think about suicide but that is stupid, I never act on anything like that. It is just a passing though time to time.

I will be in shower and zone out for 30 seconds, come back and I cannot remember if I washed my hair or not. It is always simple things like that. I still have no problem with studies, remembering appointments and generally anything that matters. Yet, I still check if I closed the fridge door 3 times within a few minutes.. Am I just getting older? Can this be a symptom of depression or perhaps something more sinister? I feel like this is something I have always had and perhaps everyone else has too, but lately it just seems too frequent to be normal..","Am I going insane or is this normal?

"I want to open up and talk to you, but my brain tells me it will just make it worse if I do.. That is my life in a nutshell, unfortunately. I know I need to open up and talk through any issue that may come up but in the back of my head there is a voice telling me that if I do, it will only make it worse. And the fucked up thing about it is that the voice is right 90% of the time because most people in my life do not percieve the things that bother me as actual issues. Fuck everything about communication, it only makes things worse. I honestly do not need anything else adding to the massive weight I bear.","I know I need to open up and talk through any issue that may come up but in the back of my head there is a voice telling me that if I do, it will only make it worse."

"Difference between antidepressent starting side-effects and hypomania? Hey all, So I have read about how SSRIs can send bipolar people who are misdiagnosed with unipolar depression / anxiety into hypomania or mania. I have also read that SSRIs can have activating effects during the start up period (including insomnia, restlessness, distractibility) that sound similar to some of the symptoms of hypomania. So if someone starting and SSRI experiences trouble sleeping, restlessness, increased energy, increased distractibility, periods of euphoria, spends money like it is nothing, increased pressure to talk/sing/dance, increased responses to music and caffeine, starting up old hobbies, etc., how can they know whether it is a combination of start-up side effects of the SSRI + feeling (much) better from the SSRI (or maybe placebo / excitement from doing something about the depression) or an antidepressant-induced hypomanic episode? I know it is a question for a professional but I like to hear experiences also.","So if someone starting and SSRI experiences trouble sleeping, restlessness, increased energy, increased distractibility, periods of euphoria, spends money like it is nothing, increased pressure to talk/sing/dance, increased responses to music and caffeine, starting up old hobbies, etc., how can they know whether it is a combination of start-up side effects of the SSRI + feeling (much) better from the SSRI (or maybe placebo / excitement from doing something about the depression) or an antidepressant-induced hypomanic episode?"
DAE stop telling people things because you feel like you are a burden I have come to the brink of my very collapse and I refuse to say anything about it to anyone around me because it comes off as attention whoring and needy. My anxiety and depression has gotten the best of me again and I am stuck in an endless loop of worry and self-pity. I am closer to giving in than ever. What have I become?,-
"I am new here. But, I would like to know how to tell if I am in depression. I have no idea where to post this at, but since I am new here I guess this is the best place. Plus I cannot start a new topic so.. Well, anyway, here is how it is: Some days I can go without thinking about her, but at night, when I rest my head on my pillow, she eventually runs across my mind. When I say she, I mean my ex. More like.. I am her ex. But eh.. this took place a while back. Maybe like.. a year and a half. I met her 3 years ago in High-school. She was my very first true girlfriend and I did not want anything to mess that up, but somehow I did that myself.. or something along those lines. After a while of missing someone it does not really matter who was the blame for what. Sometimes when I make music I sing lyrics about her and how I want another chance and whatever. I am not really obsessed with her or anything, but I sometimes want to just forget about her all at once, or wish I could go back 3 years. I guess that might be linked to regrets? Anyway, this whole thing is sort of an ON-OFF type thing, where sometimes I cannot help but think about how it was, and sometimes, she is that last thing on my mind. Sort of like I put her on the back of my mind not to think about her, and save my hurt of later?? .. If that sounds right.. Maybe I need a shrink. Who knows.. maybe i just need another girl.. But I am pretty sure no other girl is going to want to listen to me talk about my past relationships. Anyway, feedback is appreciated","I am new here.

"I am new to this forum and actually to the whole talking to people I do not know online thing. I have been looking around a lot online to find somewhere I can talk, but all the chat rooms and forums say they are about one thing and then you get inside and everything is about sex. Then I stumbled into this place. I started reading postings and everyone seems so concerned about everyone even though they have never met these people. I have not struggled with depression my whole life or anything like that. I am only 22 but feel so old. I am very, very recently separated (let is face it broken up) with my ex-fiance. We have dated for almost five years and have a son together who will be two on Saturday. He has not treated me the best (never hit or anything physical like that just never around) and he is really not what I want my husband or even the father of my children to act like. He does have moments of goodness and this is what makes it so hard because why cannot he always act like that. I know he is capable of it. I told him we should separate but I know he is been thinking it for a long time. He is been forcing things because of his family and because he feels ""respect"" and blah blah for me. I stayed around because he is the father of my child and face it it is hard to find someone new when you are a woman and you already have a kid. I love him very much and I guess I was just expecting him to wake up one day and say man I need to change or I am going to lose this great girl. I wanted to separate because I think that is the only way he is going to realize how good of a girl I am and how good I am for him. Now I am scared though that he will never come to this realization or meet someone else. He says he is not looking, but let is face it he is a man. He says he needs at least 6 months to find himself. It makes it hard on me because we have a son together and for this reason my ex is always coming around and actually now that we are not together we probably see him more. I have no family where I live and the last 5 years have been devoted to my ex and son. I have managed to lose contact with any friends I had and never made any new ones. I am now completely alone except for my son, which I feel like I cannot take good care of because I am always crying. I am a high school teacher and I had to take a couple days off this week because I am so touchy and can cry if the wrong thought pops up in my head. It is affecting every part of my life and it is so overwhelming.

"I am 46 and have been depressed since I was maybe 5 years old. I was emotionally abused by two confused parents. Depression & alcoholism runs rampantly in my family - fortunately I escaped the alcoholism. I was diagnosed as having major depression when I was about 25 and I have been on medication since then. I have also had intensive psychotherapy and done lots of research on the subject. Nothing erases the stigma!! ""Depression"" is misnamed. It should be called serotonin-deficiency disorder or something long and fancy so people will respect it. Too many say, ""Depression? Snap out of it!"" Or ""Do something to cheer yourself up."" What bunk. It affects every part of your body. Last year I realized that some of my depression was caused by kidney failure. I escaped dialysis and will probably be OK. But what a relief to have something ""serious"" to blame my problems on! Everybody respects kidney failure as a ""real disease"". I had to disown my brother last year because his reaction to my failing health was to call me a loser and an embarrassment. Very typical reaction from him, although the rest of my family were supportive. I now have no brother. I should have done it a long time ago. It takes such a long time to come to a point where you believe you deserve something good in life. I am intelligent, employed and do not do drugs or alcohol, never have, but sometimes I feel like a bum, a worthless waste of space, not worth the effort. I have to argue myself out of that mindset every day, and it is so exhausting, and people wonder why I am tired all the time and have no energy. I am very angry, too. I have never had a successful relationship and do not believe I ever can. I do not even believe it exists. No kids, either, but maybe that is a good thing. They take a lot of emotional energy. Anyway, I hate to sound like a whiner, but sometimes you have got to whine!! And I am happy to listen to everybody else and give them my support. We are all in the same boat here.","I am 46 and have been depressed since I was maybe 5 years old.

"you know how everyone hates those family get togethers, at least I do.

MY husband at the time when I spoke to him about it said that maybe it was a good idea, would be good for me. well today we had a bit of an argument over something i tried to do in here today, i just wanted him to try and understand what its like for me since he considers this a weakness not an illness, anyway, of course he went to his mothers, and accepted her offer for dinner and then came home and announced it to me, he did not even bring up the possibility of maybe having it at our house. not even for me (also they have no idea about my illness , he is embarrassed i think) anyway, now I feel like he will never try to take my feelings into consideration.

"I am working on a new app/startup to help you guys. Please read this, I would really appreciate any help/feedback. Hello everyone! I am a current sophomore in college studying Computer Science and this summer I decided to work on a new app that caters to depressed/suicidal people who are going through bad times. I want this app to connect depressed users to people who are volunteers at crisis centers or just regular people in general that are willing to devote their time to helping the users. This app will be similar to twitch where the volunteer will go live (and you can see their face) and any user can instantly connect with them. First, the user will enter their information like: what their favorite tv shows/movies/music artists are, where they are from, and what type of gender they would feel most comfortable talking to. All this information gathered will be used to connect the user with a volunteer that closely fits those preferences (the user can swipe through all of the options that are given to them and they can actually add these volunteers to a list that they would like to come back to). I want it to be a one on one session where the user can decide to turn his/her camera on, or if not, just use the microphone, or if they do not want to do either of those options, they can just use the chat box provided. I want it to be a social platform where users can connect with other users and see what they are doing. Basically a user is becoming friends with their streamers/volunteers and other users as well. Also, these one-on-one sessions can be changed to a room where there can be 4 users to one volunteer and that way more people can connect with each other with like a chaperone. I would not dare dream of making any money from this app and I know I need funding from VC is to get this thing skyrocketing. That is why I am getting all the resources I need from my school is entrepreneurial program and they are going to connect me to the people I need to know. I hate to say it but if I need to make shareholders money, then I will do it, but I do not want to make a single dime off of an idea that caters to people who are struggling through something so drastic. This may sound far fetched but my biggest dream for this app/company, is to have a box filled with goodies being mailed to users when the holidays/Valentine is Day/ birthdays come around that include: letters/voice messages from volunteers saying Happy Birthday! Or Merry Christmas! Or Happy Valentine is Day! followed by more messages that has to do with the user. This box will also include a lot more goodies that has to specifically do with the user. I used to be like you guys. I cannot say that I suffered as much as you guys but I came to this sub a couple of times when I had no one else to go to. I had no shoulder to cry on in my freshman year of college which is why I think this app could actually mean something to someone. Please, we need to try and put an end to the huge suicide rate among children/adults in America. Please provide any feedback, whether good, bad, or helpful. Anything helps, really. I can also answer any questions you might have about this app. Please excuse my bad grammar, I am a computer science major for a reason haha.","I am a current sophomore in college studying Computer Science and this summer I decided to work on a new app that caters to depressed/suicidal people who are going through bad times.

"Aha! moment during therapy So I have been meeting with a therapist about once a week since October of 2017. It is been really great, and has helped pull me from the brink more than once. Background: I am gay, and was raised Catholic in the 90s. Guess what happened next! Spoiler: I was bullied mercilessly. If I was not too gay, I was too fat, or too tall, or too weird or too unpopular. You get the gist. It it was not my hair, it was my mannerisms; if it was not my high voice, it was the dark circles under my eyes. (Gee, what could have caused me to be losing sleep?) Flash forward to today: My therapist guided me through a meditation today that instructed me to visualize and speak to a younger version of myself. I described what I looked like, what characteristics defined me, and how I saw myself. Then I was instructed to, as myself as the adult I have become, speak to that child and tell him what I was feeling. I spoke with kindness and compassion and love and respect for that child, and told him everything would be alright. I told him that all of that hatred was wrong, that it was incorrect and that those people who say all those nasty hurtful things, they probably are not even going to remember saying it, so do not waste your time holding onto it. And it got me thinking about all of the baggage I have he would onto my life. All the glances and side comments and nasty, hateful things. And how I have internalized it, and believed it. And that is when the Aha! moment came. *All this time, I have been so worried about all the bullying that other people did, I was not even thinking about all the bullying I did to myself.* All this time, *it was me.* Sure, it was other people who planted those seeds, but it was me who perpetuated it, who told myself that they were true. After all, if you say something enough, it might as well be as true as anything else. So there it is. There is one step. It might just be one step, but it is a step in the right direction. There is my holy shit moment of the day, and I just wanted to share with you all. There is hope. There is progress. There is love. And I hope you all are able to find it.","moment during therapy So I have been meeting with a therapist about once a week since October of 2017.

"Im wasting my life As a 15 year old currently, I feel like i am entirely disconnected from every human soul on this planet. I cannot properly have social interactions with others without me overthinking stuff that person says. What I mean is, if a ""friend"" tells me i am dumb jokingly, I take it at heart. I take everything too literal, I cannot properly talk to others without me being awkward and silent. I cannot talk to people if I have ignore them constantly, if someone addresses me so they can talk to me, I sometimes ignore them and pretend like I never heard them. If a person says hi to me, I stay silent. I will never get a girlfriend, i will never feel a girls hand, or the feeling of affection, comfort, and attention. I never even got to talk to a girl before. Seeing everyone at school socializing with their girlfriend, hugging them, doing everything for them, absolutely destroys me as a person. I can see why I got bullied. Those times I was called ""Pussy"" ""Weak"" ""Retarded"" turned out to be true. The physical bullying I received, when they pulled my hair and embarrassed me in front of everyone in class by flipping me off my chair. I understand now, the stuff I deserve. I can see why my dad abondoned me ever since I was born, he was never there for me, I do not know what type of man he is or how he looks like. The brothers and sisters I never met, which I dearly wish I could. They are all so young, I wish I could have been a big brother for them. I hate living in isolation and loneliness. As if I was not lonely enough at school, but now at home. Everyone takes their brothers and sisters for granted, but a person like me would love one of those. My grandparents and mom say they love me, which I do believe, but I still feel no more or less that same, it does not matter in the end. I cannot do simple activities at school that involve groups, no because a person could possibly screw it up for us, but because I need to socialize. I cannot do sports because it involves me being around people and I absolutely despise it. What am I so afraid of? Being judged? Why am I here? What am I? It does not matter, I still die in the end anyways. Maybe taking my own life is the answer, it resolves all the pain I have received. Who cares what my so called family feels? They must know its for my own personal benefit, they should realize that when I do eventually end myself, that I will no longer feel the pain I once received. I never have felt an emotional connection between any of my family, they are doing their own thing in their life. Nobody at school would care, I only have two friends. Ones I hold dear because they understand my pain. Looks are deceiving are not they? A lot of people in my school consider me attractive and cute, but good does that do me? I will not get any benefit from it either way. A bit of a description of how I look like, long hair, feminine face, a thin appearance (not super thin, I weigh about 130). But anyways, I simply plan on ending my own life sooner or later, I do not know how long I can last. We have no value, no significant purpose of existing, so might as well end it now.

The doctor has to prescribe it as one 300 mg pill plus one 150 mg pill - thereby making the patient have to pay 2 co - payments for what should be one prescription. Why does not the manufacturer make a 450 mg pill? And how can the insurance companies get away with forcing doctors to prescribe in what is really a stupid manner? I know it all comes down to money, but, of course, we patients get the short end of the stick as usual when it comes to the money issue.",The doctor has to prescribe it as one 300 mg pill plus one 150 mg pill - thereby making the patient have to pay 2 co - payments for what should be one prescription.
"First I want to introduce myself, I live in Arkansas I am 39 and a mom to 4 (18, 15, 8 and 3) I have been on and off different antidepressants for almost 4 years. Started out with celexa after I had my last baby, went through some ppd and have not been the same since. I was on celexa for 14 months then stopped for 7 months, then went back on it and totally had a bad reaction. Then came zoloft, that lasted about 3 months sent me in to some sort of mania, then there was wellbutrin, wanted to drive off the road in to the lake on that, then came effexor which I thought worked but apparently I also was going through rapid cycling, I kind of liked that. I spent 3 months on that and about a month on the wellbutrin. Then came paxil cr, was on that for 6 months but I just cant get past these mood swings and outbursts. So now I have been on Lexapro for almost 3 months, today the doctor decided to increase me to 20 mg and add lamictal for my mood swings. I am a little nervous about starting this new one. This rash I hear about sounds scary. I also take 1 mg of klonopin as needed(everyday) I just wonder if I will ever feel the same again, but then it has been so long that I do not know if I would even know what that feels like. Sorry to ramble on, but that is my story. I am to start the lamictal tonight. wish me luck!! If anyone has any input for me I would really appreciate it","Then came zoloft, that lasted about 3 months sent me in to some sort of mania, then there was wellbutrin, wanted to drive off the road in to the lake on that, then came effexor which I thought worked but apparently I also was going through rapid cycling, I kind of liked that.

"You ever get scared that you are not depressed? I have been going to a therapist for about a half a year now, and I just got diagnosed with Depression a couple of weeks ago. I have recently told my parents that I got diagnosed (I am a teenager.) and they just said that I am going through average teenage feelings. This really lead to me questioning myself, I told my therapist and he said that I am depressed but I still feel like shit.",-
"i feel like i keep sinking lower and lower into this depression, and i cannot get out from under it. i keep feeling worse, day by day, i am drifting downwards further into the darkness. maybe i am just having a tougher time of it lately, maybe i really am getting sicker, i do not know. all i do know is how i feel, and i feel like giving up. i do not want to do anything anymore, i have no desire to do or want a single thing. i cannot live like this. i just want out, to stop feeling so lethargic and so severely depressed.

"Tomorrow the world will go on like always I have never been here.. this was not a part of ""the plan"" but I said why not leave something somewhere since no one else will be receiving anything. I have lived 20 years by myself, no relationships, no close friends, and the memories of being taken advantage of in my youth haunt me day in and day out. I run away through drugs but my depression is beginning to break through my facade of confidence. No one knows who I am and even if presented with a companion I do not know if I could ever explain the scars. I hate who I am and how I act, I feel though it is not even me. Social anxiety makes me act in ways I cannot even understand and the repetition of ""I am okay"" is getting old. I have tried to make friends but no one seems to want to know me and it is left me feeling like a sociopath. Insanity overcomes me as I scream, clenching a blade that can no longer quiet my mind. I have tried so hard to not be ignorant or selfish but I cannot handle this anymore. The need of hospitalizations and psychologists remind me of the freak I am. I strive for perfection but am the opposite of it. I have so much love that I want to express but have no place to put it. I was raised religious but have so many doubts, my problem maybe is not ignorance but overthinking, I hope.. Nobody seems to understand subjectivity/relativity. There is much to be said but this will probably find its own void. I am dreaming of a different world, but the oblivion of what I do not know plagues me. I leave my love and peace here, may you find yours.

All notifications on everything have been off for nearly a week, I do not get on discord anymore. I just feel so alone, so helpless, so very tired both physically and mentally. Even something as simple as having to raid on WoW, my anxiety is horrible with dealing currently and I constantly stress out about people finding out that I am unhappy because I do not want anyone to see me like this. It is pathetic. It is the only isocial' thing I do anymore and I do not even want to do that. Playing a videogame is too stressful. P a t h e t i c. There is no fixing me I have come to realize, I just accept what is going to happen to me since I know I do not deserve to be happy.

"When I was twelve, one of my younger sisters got leukemia. Despite my failing memory I can still remember a lot of what happened back then. I can remember being picked up at the park where I was playing to rush to the hospital where my sister had been getting tested. You could say I was whisked away from my innocence, but you are pretentious and I am not. I can remember how my mother broke the news to me. And how her voice cracked a little when I asked how bad she had it. I can remember sitting in the front room of my grandparent is place, where I was staying so my parents could be with my sister in hospital, speaking to my cousin and saying that I felt it was somehow my fault. What followed was roughly a year of total disruption. My sister became the focus, understandably, while the rest of us learned to cope with the cloud hanging over us. Where a small rise in temperature could send hearts racing. But that has mostly been forgotten. Not blocked away, just forgotten. It was another age and does not feel real anymore. In the past few months the hospital has been doing a study of ex-patients and their families. Tonight it was my turn to do the phone interview. I would been avoiding it, mostly because I am lazy and I only ever seem to do things that I feel will be enjoyable to me. Anyway, so they called through and I spoke. I do not think there were really any surprises, although it was bizarre when I became conscious to the fact that I occurred to her getting cancer as it or that. I think I only said cancer once in the entire interview. Does that mean I am crazy? Struggling to cope? I do not know. Of the questions they asked, I do not think I answered any that would cause a worry.","I can remember being picked up at the park where I was playing to rush to the hospital where my sister had been getting tested.

I [18f]do not know what is wrong with me. The past year has been good for me. I have not been nearly as suicidal as past years and I have gotten back in school and met the love of my life but the past few weeks/ days I have been sinking really bad. Ive distanced myself from my boyfriend and my very few friends. I have just laid in bed and thought about ending everything. I do not know why the sudden lack of will to live. It is like I am 15 again and I am scared any moment I will end my life. I do not want to want this. I have cats that nobody would take and a little sister that would be devastated.

"Now this stupid posting thing is screwed up - I cannot do anything right Got the old depressed suicide bug again. It is funny because last night i read some articles I had written regarding death and suicide, many about saving other depressed persons from killing themselves, recognizing the pain that the survivors go through, and not wanting it to happen to my family. And then the thought rears its ugly head, it would be so easy to let myself go, go into that peaceful night, waiting until my mom dies first (soon - natural causes) and then doing it. Because I am a failure, I cannot do anything else but fail at my job. I used to write in a cave type place - a place where my writings would be secure and it is going away. That is how come I looked at my writings. I had told my therapist that it seems sometimes I feel angry and selfish and that is one of the triggers that trigger the thoughts of suicide. I have run out of visits covered by insurance I could pay for more but there is no need for visits - I have almost stopped talking. I feel like going home, crawling up on my bed with the teddy bear my husband hates and crying. At the cave web site, the others do not like to hear about suicide so I have stopped writing there (it is another site for depression type people - no one goes there now). I keep talking about death and suicide to my husband and my kid - and I feel guilty but the words and my thoughts are obsessed with death. I can make the decisions about my mom and my kid, but this halfway limbo concerning my states sucks. I guess this is just venting. My mom has at least another week to live ..","At the cave web site, the others do not like to hear about suicide so I have stopped writing there (it is another site for depression type people - no one goes there now).

"Things seem to follow you everywhere, things such as thinking of suicide and almost doing it. I did these things a few years ago well in a term of service with the US Army and was put in a ward for a few weeks and then released without even a proper name for what ever I was suffering from, and was sent to Iraq a week after leaving the ward. That as I said was a few years ago and I really never wound up in a hospital again yet, after I returned home and since it seems everyone knew I had one little problem. A problem that seems to plague me even to this day for I am now in the reserves and was yet sent to go back to Iraq but I was sent home due to on going mental problems from a few years ago. What I really want to know is there something really wrong with me or is this just a huge joke. I have been to doctors more then once and just with really nothing to go on but a shaken head. so I just was hoping someone out there knows or been though this really, as for my feelings inside it is hard for me to express I do not like to talk much of what goes on up stairs do to at times I do not really understand why at times I either feel like hurting someone or just having that lump in my throat feeling like I am going to cry but I cannot.

"Hi everyone, I am new, and feeling kind of lost and shy. To introduce myself a little, I am a 28 year old female. Up until about a year ago, I would never had any problem with depression or any other mental illness, though all of the other women in my family have depressive tendencies. Suddenly, I started to feel differently in my mind - a feeling which has gone on getting worse and worse. The last four months in particular have been a downward spiral. I moved house from a big city to a small village late last year, and I am not dealing with the change well. I do not know anyone in my local area, and I do not drive so I am stuck in this little isolated world (I work from home). I lack the energy and the confidence to go out and meet new people. I tend to organize/run everything in our household so basic routines have just fallen apart, and my long-term relationship is under strain. My partner does not understand how I feel, while I resent the fact that he is making no effort to recognize the problem and take some action to help. My family and friends are 300 miles away, and I do not feel able to talk to them. This last week, I found out my Mum is having tests run for breast cancer. I know it is early days but it is just the last little thing that has pushed me over the edge. I am walking around either in a state of complete, grey numbness or in a state of unutterable misery, unable to react to anything in a rational way. I have not left the house for days, because I hate the village where I live and being there just sends me into a blind panic attack. I have had an initial assessment for counseling in a city near where I live, but it will be weeks before I can get an appointment. I know that I need to go and see a GP and get some medication, but I do not have the energy even to pick up the phone and talk to the receptionist, let alone to walk on my own through the horrible village. And I am just so exhausted all the time. The internet is my only point of contact with the outside world at the moment. If all this sounds familiar to anyone, please reply - it would be a lifeline for me. Thanks Wizzy.","I moved house from a big city to a small village late last year, and I am not dealing with the change well.

"Hi - I am ""dad"" a new member today (12/18/05) I like what I have seen so far and have a need to express myself and get some feedback from others. It is so hard to look at yourself.. especially when wearing the ""dark glasses"" of depression. I am a man in my late 40 is - educated, with family- wife and two great, smart, loving kids, 15, and 13. I will try to summarize my story. About 5 yrs ago, I was laid off (tech field)..it was very hard to find another good position. We were so spoiled, I was making 70K - 100K in the past few years. We took it for granted. We built (4) new houses since 1989 - and did well. We enrolled our kids in a private Christian school (a high priority for us) THEN - My wife was in a auto accident and has spinal damage. She is ""mobile"", but has chronic pain. She is also suffering from depression. I managed to find another job, but it was a very dysfunctional place. I had to take a few leave-of absences - then I became ""pegged"" as a weak person. They eventually let me go for ""too many LOA is"" I am paying $800 for COBRA - we cannot do this forever..the pressure just adds to my anxiety. After seeing my psychiatrist, he took me through MANY medicines and even ECT is.. we tried for three years to find the most effective drug. Presently I take Zoloft, Cymbalta, Lamictal,Xanax & Valium for anxiety. I also have osteopenia (bone density loss), so I take, fosamax and Tylenol 4 (narcotic) for back/joint pain. Lastly, I use Soma for muscle strain. I do not know if the medicines are helping me or adding to the problem..? I admit I ""lean on"" some of the medicines as a coping mechanism. I have had so many situational events in the last few years, I suspect my depression is more environmentally caused..? I seem to ruminate on the ""bad events of the past"" too much. I am ""stuck"" - and just cannot seem to get aggressive at my job hunt. We just sold our 6 bedroom house and are now living in a three bedroom apartment. I feel guilty that my family has to go through this. I know that I have skills and experience; but I do not have the self confidence - my ego is ""on the floor"". My sleep pattern is crazy and my appetite for food (and sex) is GONE. My wife is getting frustrated with me and does not always ""build me up"".. Her depression has her down too.. With two depressed parents,it is very difficult to support each other. I feel ""stuck"" and do not know what to do..sometimes I just feel like giving up.. Any comments or thoughts would be appreciated!","She is also suffering from depression.

School is making me so stressed It is all the time. I fell asleep last night feeling okay about stuff but woke up anxious and depressed not wanting to go to my classes.

"Hello everyone. I am here because I am starting to have doubts about my mental health.. First off I am a 21 year old male college student, and up until about 2 years ago I think I have been fine..but lately I am not so sure. For one thing I cannot seem to concentrate or focus on ANYTHING anymore and it is becoming very frustrating. I find myself daydreaming or pacing only minutes after I sat down to do something important and because of it I cannot get anything done. I cannot even focus on things that should be fun, or the things I used to be dedicated too. I have also become very philosophical. I always find myself spending a lot of time thinking about life and death, the nature of existence, etc..But it seems like its becoming an obsession. I always feel like I am wasting time but I cannot bring myself to do anything constructive. Sometimes I am disgusted when I realize how much time I spend simply pacing back and forth. I also cannot fall asleep at night anymore..I just lie awake thinking and I cannot make it stop. I also have constant fears about becoming old and having regrets about how I lived and what I accomplished. I also have constant regrets about the past. It seems like there is nothing I can do in life to satisfy myself and it driving me crazy..especially because for all the ambition I have I have no motivation whatsoever anymore. Also it is hard to explain, but I get the feeling that I cannot feel life, if that makes any sense? It is like time is moving so fast that I cannot even realize it. Anyway, I was never like this before and I have no reason to be like this now. I do not have relationship problems or family problems and I am not religious. This all just came out of nowhere with no apparent cause. Basically it has come to the point where I know something is wrong with me but I do not know what. I have kept telling myself this is nothing but its getting more intense and now I feel like I am spiraling into a void or something. I guess I am simply here to seek some opinions on what my problem could be. Thanks a lot for taking the time. PS I may have posted this in the wrong place but its my first post so I am not sure..","I always find myself spending a lot of time thinking about life and death, the nature of existence, etc..But it seems like its becoming an obsession.

"Is it normal to have bad thoughts at night?

"Severe Ibs and depression combo is a death sentence Hi I posted a few times on this forum last year April sometine due to my depression and I am posting again because well, it is back. So I am just going to write a few things about myself and why I am posting here. Im a 20 year old guy from London, England and I have been depressed for about 2 years now. I was also diagnosed with IBS about 7 or so years ago. I was at university for digital media and I finished. My first year but when the second year started my IBS symptoms got worse and I was I physically unable to go. thankfully the university gave me a year off and said I can start my second year next year after I get better. However it just seems to be getting worse not better. I can barely go outside without going through severe anxiety attacks which leads to horrible pains in my stomach for which I need to go home to go toilet for, when it was really bad I would feel very faint and start having panic attacks. It reached the point where I was practically housebound. I spent like 3 months playing games, watching anime and TV shows and the pains started to get a bit better. Then 2 days ago I went toilet and it happened again, severe pain, feeling very uneasy and then boom out of nowhere crippling depression, the waves just hit me. I began feeling hopeless again, I felt unsatisfied with life. Not just my life, but life in general. Thanks to my love of Anime, Webnovels, Games and Movies I started to wish my life was like that. I know it is childish, but deep down it is just how I felt. I could not accept reality, it was too mundane for me and I was not satisfied just sitting there everyday just watching or reading things. But I could not do anything about it because everytime I try to do something my IBS kicks in and basically cripples me. And I know that even if I try and do something, it is not really what I want. I do not want my life to be normal. All I would really be doing is trying to avoid the pain that it will never happen. I know this is long and it might be hard to emphasize with me if you do not really understand it. But I just felt like I really wanted to say something and see if maybe there were other people like me. I guess you could say I am looking for friends who can understand me, I am hoping that maybe it will make living a little easier if I have people to talk about the things I love with who also understand what it is like going through depression. That is the conclusion I came up with anyway Thanks for reading","My first year but when the second year started my IBS symptoms got worse and I was I physically unable to go.

"I am 43 years old and I still feel that I am dealing with my parents' terrible marriage. I feel like I do not know anyone else who is in this situation. I have teenage children and have found that I cannot just move away because they are so embedded in their school and friends, but sometimes, just once and for all, I want to live away from my folks. Their marriage has always been terribly dysfunctional and now it is much worse as they are older. When I was young, it was awful, but I still felt like there was some love there. Now, I fell like I witness nothing but hatred between them.

And i was able to listen her. She was telling my thing to her roommate in cooked manner. And I came to know that she was jealous of me all those years because I was good than her in studies and anything. And she was thanking god for failing me in my recent exam.

"I have been in a constant rush to try and get on my feet for the last three years, but I always end up doing nothing about it. I have forgotten what motivation is all about. Hey there, I just turned 22. And this is my situation: About three years ago, I used to feel excited about everything. Finishing school, starting my studies at a university, being self-sufficient, finally doing what I thought was my future career. I am not sure what happened, but I started losing my drive. Things did not look as exciting, nor entertaining. Never having even kissed a girl, I felt alone and loveless. Still, I felt motivated enough to start working on my social skills, met a few people over the Internet, even got a girlfriend. (Thanks to the Internet I have a social life, as ironic as that sounds, even though it is not that good). Fast forward to this year, I was able to date a couple more girls, had a good time but they all ended too soon. I have never been able to have sex with the girls I have been with because I lost my sex drive in the course of these last years. Also the extremely low self esteem and self hatred do not help. Today, I find myself unable to even have a conversation with someone, mostly girls. I cannot come up with anything to talk about and I feel like all the things I learned about social skills have gone away suddenly. How do people have such natural conversations with one another? How did I manage to do it before? I feel like I want new friends, I want to have a good time, but cannot figure out where to go, or what to do to achieve that. Regarding my studies, this year was a slow one. In the time I should have completed 50% of my career, I only completed around 20%. I started visiting a psychologist because I cannot get myself to study for my exams (I am not cooperating much with him), and all I do is worry about it though I never take up the responsibility. I am fully aware of the fact that things do not come if you just sit and wait, but I cannot bring myself to do anything other than complain. Meanwhile I feel like my mind wants to run, but does not know which way to go, and my body will not budge. I think 24/7 about how I am getting older, and I am wasting every second of my life. I am completely lost and feel like everything I do is going nowhere. And I do not even know how to end this post, just wanted to put this somewhere and hopefully get some solutions or words of encouragement from people who have been through the same. Sorry for the long read.","Still, I felt motivated enough to start working on my social skills, met a few people over the Internet, even got a girlfriend.
Fast forward to this year, I was able to date a couple more girls, had a good time but they all ended too soon.
I have never been able to have sex with the girls I have been with because I lost my sex drive in the course of these last years.
I cannot come up with anything to talk about and I feel like all the things I learned about social skills have gone away suddenly.
I feel like I want new friends, I want to have a good time, but cannot figure out where to go, or what to do to achieve that."
"Questionable at best So I have been having depression/anxiety problems since middle school, I have suicidal thoughts time to time, but I have no desire to act on them? I do not mean to waste anybody is time, but sometimes it is really odd, I get these thoughts all the time usually after something angers me or upsets me, but later on I just continue with my day. My depression is not too serious, I have had small attempts, like holding a hand full of pills but never going through with it. My anxiety seems to be more severe than any other problem I have. I will be at work, just doing whatever and bam, I get anxious out of nowhere. I try breathing exercises to no avail, eventually it goes away.. I usually smoke a bunch of weed and that seems to work but I cannot do that at work or anything, anything I can do to help with that without drugs?","Questionable at best So I have been having depression/anxiety problems since middle school, I have suicidal thoughts time to time, but I have no desire to act on them?"
"Glad I can help! Firelizardee has helped me a lot over on the effexor room (that is where most of my posts are). I have never really posted my story, but for what it is worth, here it is: I live in northern New York State where I grew up on the family farm. My brother and I run a feed/hardware/farm supply store. I have got a terrific wife and two daughters ages 1 and 3. My depression hit in January during a bout with the flu; my youngest daughter was hospitalized with febrile seizures and that might be what put me over the edge. My nervous breakdown seemed to come out of the blue, but I would had an extremely stressful six months between job, illness, and adoption. I am also a hard driving firstborn perfectionist, and several family members have had alcoholism or suspected depression. So I guess depression should not have been so big a surprise, but it was. I am a happy person with a great life! But I feel like I have been right to the edge of the precipice and looked down at Hell. Now I am doing everything I can to ensure I do not relapse..but I actually think I am a better person having been through this. I am much more appreciative of a 'good day' and I am much more attuned to the suffering of others. It is amazing how many people I know have similar problems. And I hate that it has to be this way, but suffering does bring me closer to God. I hardly dare say that depression and anxiety was 'worth it'..the memory of the anguish is still too vivid, and besides, it could come back tomorrow. But right now, today, I feel more contented with my crazy, precious, stupid, dear, wasted, amazing life than I have been in years. I am very lucky to have stumbled onto the right medication the first time, and to have a supportive family that did not tell me to isnap out of it'. And I am very lucky to have the people here in this forum, who know what it is like. I hope, tvk, that in a few weeks you too will be a recovering depression survivor. Till then, we are here when you need us!","I have never really posted my story, but for what it is worth, here it is: I live in northern New York State where I grew up on the family farm.

"Hi everyone I am pleased to have found this place, maybe I will find some people here who understand what it is like to be struggling with depression. I am currently locked in my own personal hell caused by years of problems that I would never wish on anyone.

"Thoughest time of my life, and honestly i cant show it So i meet this girl for nearly 2 years ago. I would say we are probably more then best friends, we are soul friends. For over a year we talked about me moving to their town, so i can get closer to her, her husband and her kids. We have literally been talking for nearly 2 years straight. I understand that she is getting abit tired of me now, but i just moved 1 week ago and she has bearly talked to me once. She is so busy playing video games right now, the only one that really has helped me this past week is her husband. I feel i moved so far for nothing, and now its KILLING me. and since i wont have internet for a while, im getting bored out of my mind, and my depression is hitting me so hard.. I did confront her about this though, but she keeps saying she is depressed and the only way for her is to play games. Even tho when i play games, she keeps going to private worlds with friends, and whenever i as for an invite, she ignores it, even tho it pops up a big icon on her face. My life has been so hard lately, my mom lost her kids in court, other then that, my stepdad made an false accusation of me doing stuff to a child becasuse he is a fucking moron and wanted to ruin my life for fun. (And no, i didnt do anything to a kid just FYI). I won the case but it was ever lasting 3 years.. Other thatn that ive been bullied for 15 years, i have lived alone for since i was 16. Aswell im a very VERY jelous guy, so im not gonna deny that, and here is one of the issues with this: MY EX fucked my life up with cheating on me, and since then i have big trust issues, aswell i tend to get very jelous now when my best friend is getting new friends and seems to have more fun with them then me. Tho, i know my best friend would never leave me since she wanted me up here anyway, but the jelousy that she is having such a good time with others are ripping my life apart. The past 5 Months has been depression only, and Honestly if people has gone through as much as me these past 5 months with suicidal thought every day, they would of gone mental. I have a very strong mind, so it takes alot to take me down mentally, but for some reason, im lost and i dont know what to do. Half of the time i just wanna sit and cry. Before i was friend with her, i had a depression but it wasnt that bad. I didnt have friends then so i didnt have to go through what i have now, For some reason i feel like im not designed to have friends, that my life should keep going on the PC without real ""friends""","Thoughest time of my life, and honestly i cant show it So i meet this girl for nearly 2 years ago.

"Am I crazy for wanting to get back with her? So let me give you guys a bit of a timeline first: - April 2017 we met at work, became really good friends. She still had a boyfriend, but broke up with him about 2 weeks after we started hanging out. - June 2017 I told her I liked her as more than a friend, she did not feel this way towards me at the time. - July 2017 she started dating a guy she already knew, we will call him Jake. - August 2017 she broke up with Jake. Jake made her feel terrible for it and cut her off completely, leaving her to say that she hated him and wanted no part of him. - September/October 2017 she told me she is always been attracted to me, but was not ready for a relationship. I was in love with her at this time, after knowing her for a while and her being everything I want in someone. Suggested being FWB, which I took her up on. But whenever I tried to make a move on it, she did not seem to want to do anything. We hung out just us 2 every day, would always be talking, but for some reason when the time came around to make a move she never seemed to want to do anything. Mid October 2017 she said how we would be better off being friends since we did not seem to be going anywhere and that it was hurting her self esteem, and that she started talking to Jake again. She is currently still dating Jake, but from what I hear from her are on the verge of another breakup. And now I want her more than ever. I was absolutely heartbroken when she cut things off with me, and I am still not over her. And she knows this. If she cuts things off with Jake, I do not know what to do. I want her back more than anything, but at the same time it is like she put me through such pain and I do not want to chance that happening again. She is everything that I could possibly want in a girl, and I cannot imagine myself without her. And we are still friends, which probably is not helping to be honest. But she is still my best friend. Am I crazy for feeling this way?","Jake made her feel terrible for it and cut her off completely, leaving her to say that she hated him and wanted no part of him.

"So here is my situation .. I want to go to University .. Problems: I do not have a cent to my name, parents will not give their ok on the issue and I have not had a job in over a year and there are no prospects in the near future. I could go behind their backs and apply for a loan but I would just feel a lot better knowing they were ok with it all, I do not want money from them. Some meaningless minimum wage job is not going to make me feel good, if anything it will make me feel worse about myself. I have not accomplished a single thing in my life and feel this is pretty much the last straw to do something meaningful, but day after day there is another block and I have no means of getting around it, I am 100% dependant on my parents (who are usually the blocks) and I hate it.

"I have never chatted on a chat line before. So please bear with me. I am 29 years old married with three children. In the last 12 months I have lost my grandmother in September 2004, my father in February 2005, gave birth to a baby girl in May 2005, and now lost my only aunt which was just like a mother to me. The way I feel now scares me. I thought after I lost my grandma and dad I held it together pretty good, but after my aunt died I felt like I lost everything. I have always been a very strong person someone other people leaned on. Now I literally cannot get out of bed, I do not want to talk to anyone, or see anyone.

"This is a great topic. It looks like people associate with what was shared. I was laughing a little because for awhile I was so hypersensitive to sound I would not even consider turning anything on that created noise, even the noise from lights was too much. I used to go to a counselor who had a radio on in her waiting room. I could not stand it and used to turn it off. Then someone would turn it back on, having no understanding of what it was like to be me at that moment. That is funny to me now. I still do not like noise but I am lucky since I have pretty good control over my environment. For awhile I was working in cubicles and was not sure I was going to make it. The one comment I wanted to share was what I experienced when I did turn the TV back on, read the newspaper, listened to the radio. I went without it for two years. What I experienced was the way the news was presented. I was captivated not by the words or circumstances of stories, but the tone of voice, the selection of what sound bites to use, the background chosen for a shot. I am still fascinated by all that and even dreamed the other night I had been hired to be that person who decides how to present something. In my dream I was having a moral dilemma. My integrity is important to me and, in my dream, I was talking to my boss and trying to explain the emotional angst I was in. She kept saying, give them what they want, who are you to decide what is best for them. I woke up before I decided to quit or stay. But those words stayed with me through a day, who am I to decide what is best for someone else? What I do now is selectively listen to the news. I like NPR and sometimes enjoy McNeil Lehrer. I find if someone is expressing a strong opinion I will get annoyed if the presentation does not also include an opposing viewpoint. My main issue is selective presentation. I feel disrespected if someone is asking me to just trust them. I want to know what are the observations leading to a conclusion. I want to know what level of uncertainty there is. I do not like anyone telling me how to think or feel. I am perfectly capable of creating all the drama I could ever use, on my own. I am not clear where to place blame for all the drama the industry of information puts out there. I know someone is to blame. If only I could find that person or group then my hatred would be perfect. I am kidding about that last sentence. I am just trying to get a rise out of someone reading my share--I am being frisky. I support public broadcasting and free speech. If I was in charge meetings would last forever because everyone would get a chance to speak. Would not it be great if there truly was free speech in America. Would not it be great if the principle of dissent was truly an American ideal. Is not it supposed to be?","I was laughing a little because for awhile I was so hypersensitive to sound I would not even consider turning anything on that created noise, even the noise from lights was too much.

I took a massive overdose and was on life support for 5 days. When I finally regained consciousness my doctor told me it was a miracle I was alive. After that I seemed to put my life back on track. I still suffered periods of depression but nothing extreme. Until now that is. Now I feel myself slipping into that hole again and I am terrified.","I have suffered from depression most of my life.

"I am from MD and I too am going through a depression / anxiety moment in my life.

"My bottom line concern is that I am suddenly afraid of men.

I am even nervous and suspicious of men I have known, like spouses of friends. Background. My husband is in the military and has been deployed. He is been gone since September and since the beginning I have had a fear of being in the house alone at night and it has progressed to this. I am a fairly sane person for the most part. I dealt with some PPD when our son was born and my OBGYN gave me Xanax which was NO GOOD. My PCP put me on Lexapro which worked out just fine and I weaned off of it about a year and a half ago.

"Where to start.. Well, I guess I am here because I think I have depression. I did recently talk to a therapist about it a couple of weeks ago. I guess it did some good because I feel like I may have gotten to the root of my problems. She told me that I was depressed and that I have probably had a low grade depression for most of my life. I kind of thought that I was depressed, because when I would read an article about depression with 10 yes or no questions I would usually answer yes to nine of them. The original reason my wife and I went to a counselor in the first place was because my wife was mad about my occasional habit of looking at pornography on the internet. I understand this bothers her and I do not want to do anything that will upset her. I could never give her an acceptable reason why I did it. I really do not know why myself. I do not think that I have an addiction to sex. It does not dominate my thoughts or life by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I think that I am pretty ""tame"" compared to most males. Anyway, this causes a lot of strife in my marriage because my wife considers this cheating on her. Well, back to depression. We got to talking about this in counseling and the counselor asked me if I would ever been molested before. Oh boy. Well, this has always been the big secret part of my life. When I was 6 or 7 years, a female cousin of mine, who was about 4 years older, played some ""touching"" games with me over the course of 2 summers. It was all just touching, but I knew it was wrong. She would tell me that I could never tell anyone because I would get in trouble. So I did not, until that therapy session. No, I had never told my wife because I always felt embarrassed and like I was to blame because I did not do anything to stop my cousin. I pretty much told the therapist (and my wife of course), everything that had happened to me. I got REALLY upset and probably cried more than anytime in my adult life. I felt somewhat better after talking, but inside I still feel ashamed and responsible for it. The counselor said that because of those incidences, I have had a low grade depression all these years because of holding it all in. I have ALWAYS had a hard time expressing my feelings about anything to anyone. That is just me. I told the therapist that I could see the low grade depression in my day to day life, but there are times when I feel like there is a huge, massive black cloud on me. I can be doing just about anything when suddenly I have this overwhelming feeling of dread and emptiness. There are times that I feel like if I could wish for my own death at that instant, I would gladly do it. When I do not have those bad lows, I just feel numb. The therapist said I might want to try medication, but I already take two different things for chronic physical conditions, and I really do not want to take anymore drugs. I do not like doing anything that I used to do; reading, sports, movies, etc. I have a teenaged son who is just terrific. He is extremely intelligent and just a great kid. I do not want my ""condition"" affecting him anymore than it already has. My wife is sometimes supportive, but I think she is tired of my moods. I have not had the porn problems any longer and I feel like I have gotten past that. (The therapist attributed those times of porn weakness to depression and looking for a way out). I feel like since the counseling sessions that the low grade depression has gotten worse. I am glad that I talked about the things that happened and how I have felt, but I really do feel worse than before. Is there anything I can do besides more drugs? I just do not think those are the answer. Maybe I am wrong. I do not know.","Well, I guess I am here because I think I have depression.

"Why am I an idiot? I always feel the need to be loved by someone else. So I am constantly trying to talk to a girl and get a date. I actually went on a date recently.

I blame myself for that because I feel like I should have been more social with her.

"There is a big chance that I will become a millionaire in a year or 2 I got involved in Bitcoin 2 years ago, bought a lot when it was 500 600 dollars.

And also I do not really know how to feel about this. I think it is important to be humble and I never want that to change about me. But I am going to become very wealthy. I have a certain perspective on money. Money is not evil, it is a resource. It is power, you can use it for good or bad. I want to become a billionaire. You can save and dramatically change 1,00s of peoples of lives with that amount of money. I would rather have that power than someone who does not have that perspective. Does this make sense? I just feel this way about money. I feel like people think it is evil and pursuing money is evil. But you can do good things with money. And I want to do that. How should I feel and think about this? What do you think? I am going to have money and power but I do not know how to use it to help myself.","There is a big chance that I will become a millionaire in a year or 2 I got involved in Bitcoin 2 years ago, bought a lot when it was 500 600 dollars.

"I just do not know how to deal with this shit anymore. I can remember being depressed and having anxiety as early as 15 years old (31 now). I am sure I have been happy some time along the way but I cannot remember. I think most of the ""good"" times were just when I had enough energy to pretend and delude myself and convince everybody around me that I was normal and healthy. Unfortunately, as time has gone on my times of stability have gotten shorter, and my major depressive episodes have only gotten much worse, and lasted longer. I have dropped out of 4 different colleges and have quit every job I have ever had, most of them with literally no notice. I have seen doctors, I have been on different medications with no noticeable effects. I am see a doctor now, but am hoping to get in to see a psychiatrist or mental health specialist soon, but that could be a month or two away at this point. I am just completely exhausted at this point and do not know how much longer I can take it. My parent just keep telling me I need to get a job, like that would make everything better. It definitely does not help that they try to get me to go to church with the every other week or ask me all the time if I have met any girls that I am interested in. They cannot understand that just taking a shower on any given day or leaving the apartment to buy groceries is a monumental task. They ask if I am suicidal, as if that is the only way to tell how severe my depression is. I do not consider myself suicidal, but I no longer have a desire to continue living. Every day I wake up is another disappointment, another day of being incapable of doing anything and feeling sorry for myself. I am pretty sure the main reason that I am not suicidal is that I am convinced that I would fail or just would not be able to go through with it and the embarrassment would be too much to handle. As much as my family frustrates me, I understand that they are trying to help but they just do not know how. They have supported me financially on several occasions before now. Without their help I would almost certainly be homeless or dead by now. All I want is to not feel this way anymore. Every time I leave my apartment I am tense and in fear of the people around me. I escape for social situations as soon as possible only to get home and feel completely worthless. I can accept that I will always live with this illness, that it is never going away. I just want to find a way to make it bearable","I am sure I have been happy some time along the way but I cannot remember.

"I am new to the forum and just wanted to say Hi to everyone My depression stems from my husband and his secretive actions and cheating. I love my husband we have been together for 16 years and have 2 children together. He went to Thailand with his dad last year to visit his brother who lives over there working as a teacher, but before he left he found this website forum owned by a bar owner there who uses bar girl prostitutes as waitresses. To make this long story short he went with one of these bar girls while he was there and it took my children to find out the truth because I was too stupid to find out myself lol One found pictures of her in his organizer and the other found text messages on his cell phone. I should have known something was up as he never leaves his cell phone on anymore when at home anymore since he came back. He sits on that forum when at work and also at home all the men on that forum talk about the bargirls and post pictures of them also. My daughter sent a text message to the woman and she said a lot of hurtful things to her, I was worried for a few days that my husband would find out she was contacted and blame me. We also found pills he has been taking that he got from India called tadalasil which is a form of viagra, as far as I know he never had a problem sexually so why is he taking these pills? who knows lol My cousin called me a couple of days ago and said he posted a message on that forum saying he wants to go back to thailand again and what excuse could he give me for wanting to go, she said he also said that he posted he does not want to cheat on me just fuck other women when I am not around. She checks the forum for me as I do not want to see it but it hurts just as bad when someone tells you what he puts. He does not have any friends really here where we are because all he does is works so I do not know if the men on the forum are substitutes for real friends and he is putting what they would find interesting or what. I do not drive and we live out in a rural area with no real neighbors so I do not get into town barely and I do not have many real friends here as we moved here to do some job work. So that saying LIFE SUCKS really seems to fit lately lol My concern lately is sex transferred diseases such as AIDS as I found out that thailand is known as a sex trade country and many have the disease. Prostitution is illegal there but they allow businesses to operate like that bar due to the money the male tourists bring there. The government is going to give asia and africa millions of dollars to help research AIDS but they are not going to make Thailand help stop the spread of the disease by shutting down places that promote prostitution, they worry about bird flu or about people carrying weapons onto planes but they do not care if men bring a silent killer like AIDS back into our country and infect their spouses or lovers. Do I sound crazy? because sometimes I feel I am going crazy lol I am sorry for rambling on but I have held this in for months, scared to talk to him as i love him with all my heart even if others say I am an idiot and scared to talk family and friends anymore about it because it hurts to much.","He went to Thailand with his dad last year to visit his brother who lives over there working as a teacher, but before he left he found this website forum owned by a bar owner there who uses bar girl prostitutes as waitresses.

"I probably ruined everything Tonight I ruined almost a year of work. My girlfriend of 12 years and I had a really rough 10 months, and I have been working really hard to build up our relationship. However, tonight my depression and an existential crisis got the best of me, and I made a stupid decision. I tried to steal a bunch of things from Walmart, but I got caught. Her sister is the manager, and was the one who caught me. I told my girlfriend and she did not say anything. I am worried that I am going to lose her. If I lose her, I will have nothing. I may as well not exist, because she is my only source of happiness. I know I do not deserve her, but I need her desperately.","I probably ruined everything Tonight I ruined almost a year of work.

"Can we talk about personal hygiene, or lack of there of I really cannot even remember the last time I showered, and it is not even me enjoying being a nasty bitch I just do not want to? I mean, I do not like feeling dirty or like I smell bad, but the thought of getting in the shower, bathing, washing my face, getting out, putting lotion on , etc. just sounds like to much work. The most I can do is brush my teeth, but other than that I lay in bed. I mean I can get up to do things that I like on a good day like painting, but for the most part I lay in bed all day. I do not want to feel like a nasty bitch of that I am an unkempt girl but at the same time I feel like I cannot help it.

"Sometimes I worry I let my mental illness be my excuse? It feels easy to justify staying up late, not eating properly.. Not going out or not doing xyz; because I am unwell. It feels impossible to differentiate between me being unwell and me not using it as an excuse. I feel like I know who I am when I am well and I am never awake at 5 am or failing a piece of work etc. But do I allow myself to trap myself longer by not trying harder? Letting it be an excuse? I have no way to tell really. I think I have been depressed so long now that I cannot even remember what normal is. Or tell if my changes in character are related to being unwell or to me changing.

"I have lost the last of my hope for my turn. I (24M) think that without making the conscious decision to, I have given up. I think I have just reached the point where I have stopped kidding myself that it will all get better or work out someday like people always tell you. What I cannot seem to shake is the faint screaming in the back of my head trying to get me to fix everything, the one who still believes happiness is possible despite my entire existence thus far indicating otherwise. I work at a job in an office doing pointless work that I used to swear to myself in high school and college that I would never wind up doing. 5 days a week I wake up at 7, leave at 7:30, work from 8-5, and get home (at my parents' house) at 5:30. Then I eat dinner with them, watch TV with them, and they go to bed, so I turn in at 9, watch more TV, and go to bed myself. On the weekends I typically do nothing. When I do go out or hang out with a friend, we do nothing, just sit and watch TV or a movie. Unless we can find some fictional world we can discuss (Marvel, GoT, Star Wars, etc) we do not even have much to talk about. I maybe have 2-3 friends that I do this with, and again, not too often. I do not currently have, nor have I ever had, anything even resembling a love life. I was foolishly in love with a close friend who felt nothing for me thru high school and most of college before I managed to stop kidding myself on that one. I have never had sex with or even kissed a girl. The closest thing I ever did was cuddle with a really close friend, and I even fucked that up because I overthought everything as always and did not make a real move, and she instantly lost interest/gave up on me, and now we are barely even friends anymore. I am an introvert with no desire to change. I have no interest in going out to bars, clubs, or anything people my age for some reason enjoy. All I want is a person to love and spend my time with and provide each other with the human contact we need. My idea of the perfect evening would be cuddling on the couch with a girl I love and watching Netflix, just enjoying the closeness, maybe some kissing. Sex is something I want but not even on my radar right now. My life goals can be summed up in saying I want to find my person have a kid or two, and do what I can to make them and myself happy. I just honestly do not see the path to that reality, though. Nothing matters to me anymore. Just my parents, and I can honestly say that I am 100% safe as long as they are around because I care more about them than myself. However, if they were gone tomorrow, I think I would be close behind. I just do not see a path out of this pointless existence that I feel capable of taking. I feel like I am just serving a sentence, going through the motions until it is mercifully done. No question really. I just felt the need to say it and acknowledge that I am done. With everything. TLR: I am done, burnt out. Life is never been good to me and I have stopped expecting my turn. I see no way to achieve the few things in life I want.","I think I have just reached the point where I have stopped kidding myself that it will all get better or work out someday like people always tell you.

"It is extremely difficult for me to cry. I used to deal with depression through breaking down and crying at night, and it was a really helpful way to out all the negative emotion, and I always felt much better after. For over a year now, it is been extremely difficult for me to cry. Unless I am pushed to the absolute edge, when I feel like I should be crying it is more just a feeling of emptiness. This means that I feel like I can never release my feelings, and that it feels really greyscale at times, and on the rare occasions I can cry it hardly helps as it is basically a panic attack at that point. I do not really know why I am posting this, but does anyone else deal with this? I would love to hear from someone who maybe has advice on how to handle it.

"Ok here goes. I actually feel like I do not deserve to be looking at this site. I have been sitting here all morning reading through everyone is posts and have been think that I have no right to hate my life. I have a good family, friends and have had experiences other 20yr olds would only dream of. But there is something in my head telling me that my life sucks and nobody cares if I am here or not. Then the real me kicks back in and I think I am stupid for thinking that. STUPID. Stupid for thinking I have no purpose. So that makes me feel even worse. I fear. I do not know. Being alone and rejected I guess. I do not do I often but when I am having a 'fat week' I have purged and over exercised. I do not know if this is because I really think I am fat or. I do not know why else, but I am not overweight. I have never told any one any of this in person. I cannot do it. I hate sympathy. When I am around my friends I am totally the opposite. I am so hyper and half the time it is not even an act sometimes I just cannot control. Other times I do have to put it on just so that do not ask me if anything is up but I have never failed to fool them.

"My girlfriend died and I do not know how to go on.. She had cancer and was 27.. We have been together for 9 years and were going to marry in a couple of years.. We had lived for 2 years by now and everything was going perfectly.. maybe too much.. We were faithful, devoted to each other. She was my oxygen, I was hers. She was my first and truly love. I have never been with any other girl but her.. I feel kinda depressed and alone.. We had no many friends, so that just the two of us was enough for the most part of our lives.. I will leave for our house next week, since I have been with my family so far..

"Anyone else hate talking about depression specifically because all the attempts at help feel fake? Guess it is stupid posting this, all things considered, but I am a moron anyway and besides that I am also looking just to see if I am alone in thinking this. Like at this point I would rather just hear comments from people who are also feeling down. Help from others makes me fucking angry at them, especially strangers, because it does not do anything. It does not make me feel better to be told things will get better!, it does not help to be told I am loved, and in the event people bring up stuff like you will never get to have a family (yes this does happen as though that matters) it makes me want to actually hurt them in real life. I do not and cannot, but holy shit. I do not even like when friends try to make me feel better anymore because it feels like they do not even get the point. What sucks though is trying to get over that primal instinct to not kill myself. I do not particularly want to live and I really do not want to live past ~40, but my dumb animal brain just thinks owie death and pain bad and will not let me do it. I am kinda hoping that maybe instead I can get into an accident or just get really ill.","It does not make me feel better to be told things will get better!, it does not help to be told I am loved, and in the event people bring up stuff like you will never get to have a family (yes this does happen as though that matters) it makes me want to actually hurt them in real life.

"Alienating family Do you ever get tired of saying you are okay when you are not but you do not want to talk about it? So instead you just stop talking to them but then you feel worse for alienating your family and they have no idea why or what is going on with you. My family has never been super close. We get along with each other and talk to each other but we are not a support system and I do not feel comfortable talking to them about my problems. I feel like I will be judged and gossiped about so I just keep it to myself and as a result wind up pushing them all away. The only person in this world I feel I can talk to about my problems are my husband and I know that is a huge burden on him to be my only outlet, my only friend. It is putting a strain on our relationship and I blame myself for this. It is a lot of pressure to put on someone. Living with a person with depression is hard enough under normal circumstances (whatever normal is) but add the burden of being the only friend, the only person that knows, the only person period. Eventually that only person is going to get tired of it.","So instead you just stop talking to them but then you feel worse for alienating your family and they have no idea why or what is going on with you.

And I remember dropping everything I was doing at work, and rushing to the hospital. Slowly walking into the room, with your family gathered around you, that is when it hit me, and I broke down.. I lost it.. Could not control myself, and I could not stop crying. When I had to say goodbye, it broke my fucking heart.. Losing my best friend, my fianc, was the hardest day of my life. But every year after, the pain slowly faded away, and it did not haunt me anymore.

But last night, when your sister called, and told me that your dad passed away in his sleep from a heart attack, it was like the whole world had stopped spinning again..

"There truly is no hope. For any of us. This is the bleakest truth of all. Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you will not know for twenty years. And you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it is what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but it does not really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved.

"Starting antipressants Hi, I am a male in my early 30 is and going to meet with an intake doctor tomorrow.

Do any males have experience with taking medicine and their effects?",-
"Hi all, I have just registered here.. I have been depressed for quite a while, my dad died when I was 7 and my best friend died when we were 18. After the death of my father I was in counseling, but my counselor stopped coming to school to see me and I do not think I ever got anywhere from it. I am currently 23, almost 24 (and male, from the UK for those keeping count) I have felt crap for ages.. I hate my job, and doing that along with the stress of my final year of university sent me on a downward spiral. I would worry so much about my workload, but have no motivation to do it and get out of the situation. I hate being single, but cannot find someone special who likes me, who I like back. I want to leave my job, but I cannot afford to until I leave university and get a job doing something I want to. I had thought about suicide, but I know the pain of losing people close to me, and I could not inflict that pain on someone else. I considered cutting myself too. I thought that maybe if I was hurt, I could get extra time for university work, and maybe someone would help me. But I realized that I should not do that, and should see someone about it. I also did not have the balls to do it. I think bad thoughts a lot but I do not think I could go through with them. I was worried about going to the doctor though. My previous experience with a counselor has put me off them, and I do not like talking to strangers about my problems - that said I do not like telling people I know either because I feel that they will judge me. I was also concerned about medication because I do not know if I like the idea of chemicals altering my brain (apart from alcohol that is!) But about 3 weeks ago I finally went to see my doctor. He has put me on 20mg of Fluoxetine a day, although I am not sure whether it is doing much. I have been having headaches and going a bit dizzy as well as getting sleepy (among other side effects). It is weird though, I do not know whether I am feeling better or not, my friends say I seem different and better for taking it but I still feel bad at times.. I still lie in bed at night worrying. But I think maybe I need to take it more and see how it effects me long term. I guess even on medication we all have good days and bad days. I was scared to tell my mother that I was on anti-depressants, as she works in mental health. Some would see this as a blessing as she understands the field to a great degree, but I was worried because I thought that she might think I was mad. I eventually got the courage to tell her after about 5 days though because I was very dizzy and I thought that she would suspect me of being on illegal drugs. She is being very supportive now, while still keeping enough distance that I do not feel like she is worrying too much about me. It is good to know that she understands that it is going to help me cope though.. and she says its only a minor drug compared to what some of her patients take to stop the voices telling them to do things. Anyway I decided to look for somewhere online where other people know what it feels like, and I am glad that I have found this place. I hope I can make some new friends here, and maybe I can help a couple of people too.","My previous experience with a counselor has put me off them, and I do not like talking to strangers about my problems - that said I do not like telling people I know either because I feel that they will judge me.

"Frustration I do not understand why I am depressed.. I am pretty sure I am depressed, I do not feel much joy in life, I have trouble feeling enjoyment outside of compulsive/ harmful activites, I just feel numb, pointless. My thoughts turn to suicide quite often, but I would never do it. I can say that I think of suicide somewhat less than I used to.. so there is been improvement. I do not understand why I am not better, or what else I can do outside of medication. I run, I work hard and do well at work, I am a dedicated father and spend lots of time with the kids, I am dedicated to making sure they feel loved and cared for, their needs are ahead of my own.

"The last few weeks I have slid back almost as far as before I started treatment. Just when I thought I was improving. I finally went to the drop in center called Sunshine Place, as someone was giving a talk on depression. The counselor spoke with me for about half an hour after her talk and said she thought I needed more help than my GP was giving. For the first time in a few months I actually broke down and cried again - which is very annoying to me. She wrote down the number of the Mental Health Center with some suggestions for them. I rang the next day for an appointment (and that was hard just to ring). She had told me I might have to wait a few weeks for them to see me, but they made an appointment for the next day. The psychiatirst there was okay (I did not even cry like I normally do when talking to a new doc) but I told her I was tired of telling the same things to every new person. The short of it is they are changing me from Lexapro to Avanza and organizing for some CBT. I see my regular GP next Tuesday so I am pleased they said they would inform her of the medication change. I was also warned that I would probably feel a bit more depressed while the medication change was taking place; so I duly warned Mom and Matt not to take any notice of any strange behavior. Matt as usual just laughed and said ""yeah, Mom is going to go psycho"". Now I just wait for them to contact me about the CBT. If I do not answer any posts you will know why, but I will try to just put a little emoticon up every now and then to let you know I am thinking of you all, and that I am still listening.","The counselor spoke with me for about half an hour after her talk and said she thought I needed more help than my GP was giving.

"Lately, I have been going to sleep later and later into the day just so I can avoid ppl and avoid dealing with depression/being sad. But, by the time I do wake up/ cannot sleep anymore, I feel more depressed than when I originally was. And yet, despite all of that, I still have this need to sleep excessively because I keep having dreams that are more entertaining, adventurous, and exciting than what is currently going on in my life. And even when I rewire my sleep schedule back to normal, I still end up going back to the messed up sleep schedule just cause I hate feeling depressed and hate dealing with it.",-
"Ice 'n' snow 'n' sleet..damn! We had to stay an extra night in B-ham because of the icy roads between here and there. I had an obscenely fun time, and it reaffirmed that I am a complete sucker for 4-part harmonies.

"My brother has depression and I need help I will start off by saying I am not sure if this is the right place to say this and if it is not, I would love if you could point me in the right direction. My brother has a multitude of things such as depression, anxiety and anger issues. Recently he has been going to IOP ( cannot exactly remember the name, but it is a step below inpatient care) at a facility and he has shown some progress. I feel like he is more in touch with how he feels and is working on coping mechanisms better. However he did not go to his session today and that caused problems. He got his check from work today and it would not get deposited, and that set him off into a fit. He started breaking things and getting in both mine and my parents faces, cussing and attacking us. We had a conversation after and he said he tells himself the thing we tell him, such as how he needs to be more rational and more committed to getting better. He also eats unhealthy and is overweight, and I have attempted to help him get healthier about a month ago, but he stopped listening to me about. I love and care for him deeply but our family is at our wits end with what to do. I would want to leave him be and let him sort his issues out without us harassing him about it but when he gets violent and angry around the house we cannot sit idly. I am not sure what the next step is but I would love to hear advice from anyone. Thanks for listening.","My brother has depression and I need help I will start off by saying I am not sure if this is the right place to say this and if it is not, I would love if you could point me in the right direction.

"In college (10 years ago) I was the victim of a gang rape. I have read up quite a bit and identified with all the stages and normal reactions.. I went through the self blame, and guilt, and anger, and depression, and I came to realize it was not my fault. I never reported it and after a year I decided the best thing would be to forget about it. I pretended it did not happen and went on with my life. I forced it out of my thoughts until it was no longer a struggle to do so. Eventually I almost did forget about it. I never thought about it and when the subject was referenced in other contexts I never even thought about my particular experience. It almost became some movie I saw, or some girl I knew about. I am married now with a four year old child and I have a really great life. About six months ago I started having these rape fantasies. I have been too embarrassed to ask my husband to act them out, but he does oblige in rough sex, and I started asking for it more often. I have felt confused as to why I would want this with my husband (and it is always with him .. I do not desire this with anyone else) when I have this history. It started me thinking about them even again. Then I started having nightmares about three weeks ago. Horrible realistic dreams where I actually wake up and I am still hallucinating that men are holding me down. Last night I punched my husband full in the chest because I thought he was attacking me when he was just trying to wake me from a nightmare. This along with the COMPLETE lack of sexual desire where before we had a very healthy sex life. I am a big fan of the ""STOP THAT"" approach to self help, but I cannot seem to stop this. I am beginning to dwell on it now. Also I try not to ever deny husband and with the high job related stress he is having right now he is seeking sexual gratification every night. I am beginning to dread bed time, and after he is asleep I am up on the computer and drinking!","About six months ago I started having these rape fantasies.

"Please someone read this, i have been holding so well since my dad died but now.. I feel like killing myself is sooner or later inevitable. I came back home from my boyfriend is house because I think I should spend some time with my mom. My dad is death made me speak what I feel and even stopped suicidal thoughts. But today.. I decided to be honest about few things unregarded to my dad. Now mind you, me and my mom has always had rocky relationship and I would never tell her much. Now I reminded myself why.. Since my dad died I have been honest to her about my limits towards me seeing his corps the day before burial and I have been crystal clear that this Saturday I did not feel ready yet to go to the cemetery and I assured her that I will surely go one day. An hour ago she told me that me telling her all of that is avoiding all those responsibilities. I am shocked, I feel hurt, I feel anger and.. Hatred.. One of my coworkers told me ""do not do anything you have no strength for, do not push yourself, everyone grieves differently"". She is the only person that understands me.. I will talk to her tomorrow because she will understand. She is such a kind person.. But not.. I feel so weak and I feel like sooner or later I will kill myself because that is too much, I have no one to realistically help me besides good words. I feel like now there is nothing that will hold me. At least i want to be understood by someone. I will not get it from mom, I feel like I will not get it from boyfriend. Im too tired, I really am.

"I have been reading the ""hoarding"" thread in the OCD forum and I am jealous. They are having fun bonding by sharing stories about their habits, so I thought we could do some of that with plain old depressives.

"Anyone else feel they are unloveable? TLDR: I feel I have no friends and anybody I get close to leaves I started noticing I was always unhappy and sad in my last year of high school. I did not understand the point of life anymore and everyday driving to school I just thought how easy it was to drive off a cliff on the way to school. I got scared and told my parents who helped me get professional help. I confided in my 3 best friends at the time and almost immediately I noticed 2 of them stopped talking to me. The third I am still friends with but not nearly as close as I used to be. When I went to college, my roommate and I became best friends but a year later, he decided to drop out and leave. I realize this is through no fault of my own but it still sucks losing a best friend. Finally, my 3rd year of college, I met the most amazing woman. With her help, I felt like I finally defeated depression. We dated for 2 years and I was so sure we were gonna last. However, I got a job on the east coast whereas we were both from the west coast. We decided we could last through the distance so I took the job and moved 300 miles away. She just told me it was not working out and broke up with me. She was my best friend and my girlfriend for 2 years. I never felt a connection with anyone else as strong as I did for her. Now I am fearing my depression may have come back. I am thinking I did not defeat depression but instead had her to use as a support. I am here on the east coast of the US and I have no friends or family around me. I do not know what to do and everyday I just feel like it is me vs the whole world. I have already lost all hope and I feel like I do not deserve happiness. Why else would happiness be ripped from me every time I feel like I found it.

Just feeling very isolated right now. It is one of those situations where all I want is for someone to realize I am drowning. All I want is to be offered a hand up.. To feel like I actually matter to someone. I recently lost what I would consider to be my last friend IRL and have not been out of the house for any reason other than work in weeks. The person I call a best friend is a person I have known less than six months who lives half way across the country. I have been waiting around hours hoping he will ask me for a phone call. He has not. And I do not want to continually pester him since he has not offered me a phone call tonight. I do not really know why I am posting in this group. I guess so maybe I can imagine that someone somewhere will read my current thoughts and maybe I will not feel quite so alone.

"I am a 24 year old woman living in Florida with my husband. I have been severely depressed for 6 months, and now looking back I can see that it actually started about a year and a half ago. If only I could go back and warn myself. Like many of you, I have been suffering depression since I was very young. In fact, I can remember being in first grade, coming home and going to bed for the rest of the night. Of course, back then it felt more like fear. In 7th grade, I asked my mother if I was a manic depressive because I had read about it and I felt I had all the symptoms. She scoffed and said it was just normal teen hormones that made me feel that way. I love my mother and she has always been there for me. I used to call her at 2 in the morning crying and she would talk to me until I felt better. However, when I call her up today, she still does not understand when I tell her I am depressed. She thinks I need to get up and start doing things until I snap out of it. I try to tell her I have bills screaming at me and I still cannot get out of the house to find work. I think she is in denial. Now, with all of the information I find on this site, I think I may even be bipolar. When I found the man I wanted to marry, I warned him that I had experienced many deep depressions in my lifetime and that it was probably likely to happen again someday. He said he would stay by my side no matter what, and he has. Unfortunately, it is painfully apparent that he has no idea at all how to handle it. When he tries to talk to me and cheer me up, I say mean things to him until we are both raising our voices. Let me tell you, when I am like this, I do not back down either. I usually say something hurtful and then grind my teeth in anger for a while. He gets mad too, but it is also painfully apparent that he forgives me. Then, I feel like a real jerk. I just started seeing a psychologist, since I have not had a job since last August and it is clear that I do not know my way out of this. I have only met with her once, but I think I will like her. She has told me to do a few simple things everyday until our next meeting on Wednesday. She wants me to get 1/2 hour of sunlight everyday, 15 minutes of exercise, and try to make a simple daily schedule to follow. I am a bit worried because I have not been able to do them because I just do not sleep right anymore. It is 8am and I have not slept yet. I may fall asleep in a few hours, only to toss and turn and then wake up in the evening feeling like crap. I have tried some medicines but they do not help. Have any of you had this problem? What did you do?","Like many of you, I have been suffering depression since I was very young.

"Me too. You want a friend. You want someone to be there with you when you are weak, and someone to comfort you when you are down. You wish you were not alone but you feel invisible. You are trapped in your thoughts and nobody can reach you. You feel like you cannot do anything right, like you are useless. Everybody has friends except for you. You are a burden and nobody actually likes you, you just exist. You push people away because you feel like you do not have anything to offer, so you would rather just be left alone.

"No lodging for the sad Being depressed sucks. That is easy to grasp. Most people who are not clinically depressed understand this. What they do not understand is that being depressed and honestly trying to get better is extremely difficult, and our ruggedly individualistic society does not give a single fuck about you. You need help? Fuck you. Your wealth is not just something you have, it is seen as a reflection of your worth as a person. Poor? Sad? Find it difficult to wake up? Find it difficult to complete things? Do you procrastinate because of underlying psychological issues? Fuck you, you are just lazy. The clear message capitalism sends me is that if I cannot work, or I cannot work enough, or I cannot work doing a ""high value job"", or if I need help to get better so that I can do those ""high value jobs"", I probably ought to just go die, because I am clearly worth nothing.","What they do not understand is that being depressed and honestly trying to get better is extremely difficult, and our ruggedly individualistic society does not give a single fuck about you.

"I am not sure where to start. I have been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, disassociation, and bipolar. I am also a cutter, suicidal, I hear things and see things. Needless to say I do not deal with stress very well. Sorry this is not a good introduction; but I really do need some help. I am a college student only because the VA (veterans Affairs) is paying for it through their vocational - rehabilitation program. I am unemployed. For 3 months I have been fighting with social services just to get food stamps. I finally got them. Beforehand food was scarce. I have had eviction notices and by miracles my roommate and I manage to get just enough money to not get evicted at the last minute. I have missed class and 2 therapy and other doctor appointments because I have not had the gas money to get there. I apply for jobs every day, but I have absolutely no luck getting a job.

"Well, it is been a year now since I tried killing myself A year ago on December 1st I tried to kill myself. I spent a week in a psych ward and have been on lots of meds and doing lots of therapy since then. The therapy has helped quite a bit, I have slowly learned how to listen to myself and how to take things one day at a time. As far as meds go, my anxiety is much more controllable and my sleeping meds actually work (mostly) so I cannot complain too much. I do not think I am ever going to overcome depression. I have kind of learned to live with it, sure, but beating it probably will not happen; I am way too cynical to beat it. It is just how I am wired. There is a lot in life I probably will not get to experience because of how I am. And I still do not know how to change that, or at least make some good out of it. I guess what I am trying to say with this post is, I am not sure if I am happy or not. It is the not knowing that bugs me.

Some people describe me as cold as I do not really have any genuine reactions to anything just pure neutrality some even say I lack empathy. I keep most of my feeling and thought for myself and the only thing that is wierdly funny to me is dark humor and misfortune of others. My attitude on the outside, most of the times, is ""I do not care"", but when I am alone, then shit goes down, anxiety, depression, dark thoughts you name it. I can go days without seeing anyone or speaking to anyone when I am in this pit of my own making. But then again, I still have this slight need to socialise after some time. The thing is, some time ago, one of my closest friends asked me, what made me happy, when was the last time I was truly happy? And what worried me, I could not think of anything, still after thinking for like an half our, there was nothing. Do not get me wrong, I still laugh and sometimes even smile, but for me positive and happy people seem fake. Anyone in a similar situation? Some advice would be appreciated.","I just want to know what is really wrong with me, should I get help or something..I often think about myself like I am a negative person.

"I miss the days where I at least had depression sleep to look forward to. More of a vent here so bare with me. I have not had a good night of undisturbed deep sleep where I wake up feeling refreshed in years. Like, I kinda autopilot through my day trying to ignore how nothing really excites or motivates me and that I have stopped progressing towards any dreams or goals, and the more I am awake the longer I have to struggle with that and I do not even have sleep to look forward to. I used to be able to sleep through anything and for many hours at a time. It was awesome. Idk, just like I am riding a vicious cycle of depression worsening sleep, sleep worsening depression slowly downwards to the point where I think not existing would finally feel like the best damn rest I ever had.

"I get angrier while running When my depression flares up (mostly in the winter), I get what I call nothe angrys'.

"That feeling of good at night, dread in morning I feel good in the evenings, planning etc. Come the next morning it is dread and anxiety. Always had it but in the last three years I have been hit with health, friendship and security issues. It is definitely aggravated this feeling. I have to travel to different places for work. But I dread it now. I am not in the position to get therapy. I know the issues, not much more than others out there. I have always just kept busy and got on with things. But this dread is getting much worse. I read it has something to do with the brain not wanting to change all the time. Going places etc. Plus health, security etc. So it makes sense my brain is telling me not to go places. But, this is life and I need to work. No choice.

Feeling ashamed of my depression..does anyone else feel like this? I have been going through a really bad depressive episode and today at school someone said remember when you were all isunshiney' and happy and laughed all the time?

"Dead is better than alive imo. I would not say I feel particularly sad or depressed, as a constant state. It is all over the place. But I think I do want to die. I choose to believe there is nothing after we die; no afterlife, no heaven or hell, no reincarnation, or godly ascension. Just a beautiful, peaceful nothing. And it just seems so much better than being alive. When you are alive, you feel so much. Yes, there is happiness, excitement, surprise, love. But there is also sadness, anger, hate, jealousy. Why would I chose to bare such things when death can provide none of these things? All the good stuff about living does not weigh out the bad, in my head. A nothingness after death just seems like the better, more rational option. Am I wrong to think this?","But I think I do want to die.

"Getting over a girl Hello everyone, I have been subscribed to this sub for a while now but always been a lurker and never posted anything. I feel that this is the best place to get advice and help for what I am going through right now.. So I am a 19 year old guy, I have never had a serious relationship with a girl before. I met this girl a few weeks ago and I instantly liked her. She is the most amazing girl I have ever met. She is funny, smart and so beautiful. We started texting/snapchatting. I told her I liked her and she said she felt the same about me. We started talking and we met a few times and things were going really well. Last weekend she stopped over at my house and we watched some Netflix and had such a good night with each other. I knew I was in love with this girl and I could honestly see us getting in a relationship in the future. After she left my house the following morning she started acting weird. I asked her what was wrong and she said her ex boyfriend was going crazy because she stayed over at my house. She then said she just needed to be alone for a while and that we should stop seeing each other because she still has not properly got over her ex. It was so horrible, I started crying for ages and I could not stop. I still feel so upset about it and I do not think I will ever be able to get over her. How can I get over her? I cannot stop reading our texts messaging of us saying we love each other. This is so hard. I am crying again.","I met this girl a few weeks ago and I instantly liked her.

"Realising your mental state and life is unfixable sucks Just started to realise this. Been working my way to suicide last year but it did not work out. So I am trying my best (how ironic) to just feed myself everyday, and not letting my emotions burden the ones I love (or any person I come across). Basically just existing plainly. I really wished I could show affection to those I love and care about. But I realise that without any qualities as a person, I am better off just not being a nuisance and a liability. Feeling lonely sucks. I wished I feel loved by those whom I love. But staying away (while not killing myself) is my only way to protect them from myself. Oh well.

".. being that I do not know anyone here yet, but I feel like I am about to boil out of my skin if I do not get some of this out. Last week I left the house for the first time in nearly a month and saw my doctor about the state of my head. It was the hardest thing I have ever done (that did not involve burying a loved one) as I was brought up to believe that one should not talk about one is feelings with other people. Although the sawbones made all the right noises I do not know if he even believes me. I do not know if seeing him was the right thing to do because since walking out of his surgery all I have had is deeper anxiety, more guilt, and a feeling of total and utter desperation - I think it is actually a little worse than before. I feel like this is not going to get any better, ever. I am scared .. I do not know how this is going to end up for me. I cannot see a way out. I have been depressed for a very long time but since losing my job a little while ago I have hit the proverbial bottom. I have suffered from anxiety for many years but recently it has been getting worse - I had my first panic attack last year. It does not matter what I try to do to stop it, all I can think about is death, pain, more death, failure, and yet more death. I have been having horrible nightmares for months (and have not slept properly since my teens). Long story short (ish): when I was little the Infamous They told my parents I was 'gifted'. They had high hopes for me. I won a scholarship to a good private school, where the other little girls made fun of me. Then the scholarship ran out and I had to go to a state school. Where the other little children made fun of me, spat at me, physically attacked me and eventually my parents had to take me out of school altogether. They found a better one, where the other kids continued to make my life hell. When I was about 12 or 13 I started self harming (cutting my arms with broken light bulb glass). My mother noticed once, shouted at me, and then never raised the subject again. I continued to do it until I was about 17. My dad bullied me when I was a kid; basically he subjected me to about 15 years of mingled disinterest, public humiliation, and emotional abuse. Then he did a disappearing act three years ago - leaving my mother in financial trouble. I have not heard from him since. I have wasted my life. Nothing I have ever attempted has succeeded - really nothing, and I have never been able to please the people I was trying to please. I used to think I was a talented artist (wanted to be a comic - book artist) but now I have no self - belief left. I have not picked up a pencil in weeks and I cannot even bear to look at any of my work. I cannot do anything anymore and there is nobody I can talk to - my mother is my only close family and she does not believe in mental illness (if I mentioned it to her she would, at best, get angry and tell me to grow up / stop being so self indulgent). I have two close friends who have their own problems to deal with. I am seeing the doctor again on Monday but I fail to see what he can do to fix the fact that I am a useless failure. I am so scared and confused. I have been crying for about a week now and it is getting really tiring. I am scared that maybe what I think is depression is really just an excuse to attempt to explain my pathetic behavior, that I am really a hypochondriac (my anxiety is now constant and I have convinced myself I am going to die any minute from any terminal illness you would care to name) and I am wasting the doc is time & resources. He offered me sleeping pills but I said no as I was afraid to have such things in the house. Basically, not a good week. Sorry to vent like this but I had to get it out .. sorry for being so selfish.",".. being that I do not know anyone here yet, but I feel like I am about to boil out of my skin if I do not get some of this out.

"Hi everyone. I am also a new member. I am 22 years old and a single mother of one. I have had bipolar tendencies since I was a young child and was diagnosed at 16 or 17. The past few years since my daughter was born have been the best ones for my moods. I attribute part of that to the success I seemed to have on Lithium for two years. I stupidly went off the medicines and my thyroid medicines as well in November without telling my doctor. Lately things have gotten fairly rough. I know I have to get back in to the doctor, and I will. It is just that my life is so busy right now that it is hard to find the time (and the courage!). I am glad I found this great site.

Just cut off all of my friends and I am feeling alone and regretful Posted this to r/advice but I think that was not the right place for it. I just cut ties with nine people who I considered family for almost 10 years. Their negativity and inability to understand what I am working towards has literally taken a huge toll on myself. Friends are suppsed to support you through the good and the bad but instead I was being anchored and every time I felt I was getting out of it I was pulled back down. The fact that I was so attached to them made this one of the hardest things I have ever had to do in my life and it took every ounce of myself to finish telling them I did not want anything to do with them. They do not understand that in order for me to become a doctor I have to commit a lot of time to my studies. But if I cannot show up to something such as drinking I get absolutely torn apart by them. It is like they hate when I am productive but they enjoy seeing me partake in stupid shit. They have told me that I am a liar and a terrible friend on numerous occasions and it is just too hard to even reason with them at this point. Did I over react and should I iron things out with them?

"Hi everyone, I am new to this site and my name is Elie. I am a 38-year-old married mother of three girls and one angel baby boy who was born still 10/30/2003. My children is ages are 18 years old, 15 years old then it would have been Conner Charles. When we lost Conner due to an underlying infection and when I had the amniocentesis the infection got to Conner and he died a month later. That was very devastating to us but I have had a lot of support with an infant grief group in our area. After we lost Conner three months later we got pregnant with Charlene and she is so beautiful. Anyway things were going good (oh I forgot to mention the fact I remarried my ex husband. We were divorced for 14 years and we got back together). One day when the baby was 11 months old my husband accidentally spilled hot coffee onto Charlene is leg and she had a blanket sleeper on so she was not that bad. It was bad enough but because of the way the burn looked (due to the absorption of the stupid hot coffee) the doctor had her removed from our care until they could further decide if the baby was abused. I was dumbfounded; I have known this doctor for 17 hears with my girls Marissa and Jessica, so how dare he. I was so upset, but we have a DSS worker in our lives because of my middle daughter who has mental retardation, she is in a residential home because of her behaviors which in a way was excellent for us. Our worker seen and knew Charlene before the foster care and then when she finally saw her at foster care she did everything in her power to get the baby back and we did six days later. We are constantly in and out of court now because of this and then my husband was feeding the baby oatmeal and I was warning him to be careful she flails her arms, well she flailed and knocked the spoon out of his hand and the clump of oatmeal landed on her face .. we cleaned her up not noting anything bad as she did not cry or nothing she wanted to eat. She ended up with a blister on her cheek in the spot that the oatmeal touched. We almost lost Charlene again. I went into DSS and said my husband was no longer going to be in charge of the baby and they felt better and I also said he wants parenting classes and they liked that idea. But this is my problem, how do I get passed this. I have a counselor already but you can never have too much support so I came to this web site. I cannot even make love with my husband anymore. I resent him for putting me through this when I have been the most careful mother around. We also live with his mother because financially things are tight and right now its better we do because DSS notes it is a very supportive environment and I have a lot of help which I do but I cannot leave otherwise I will have DSS up my back quite often. My husband feels that sex is the cure all to depression, he keeps hounding me and hounding me and I just do not want sex. When we first got back together this second time around things were awesome and we had so much fun but then we lost Conner, then had Charlene and then these burns and losing her and going to court. I have no say whatsoever even in my own room which depresses me but soon I will try and figure out how to get out of this. All I know is my husband better respect my wishes, I just cannot make love at the moment. The last time was four weeks ago. Ok that is about it for now, that is about the main stuff I am dealing with for now. Take care","After we lost Conner three months later we got pregnant with Charlene and she is so beautiful.

Guess I am jus rambling now, have finals in about 5hrs n I am doing my usual caffeine fueled all nighter to save something I do not intrinsically care about but still need cuz I would feel even shittier if I do not get my degree. N when I do get it, I will be just as purposeless and empty while im pursuing the next career step, it is a fucked up cycle.","If I stick it out I Kno I have a path to a good career (dad has connections, blah blah I Kno) n a few people ive talked to basically tell that I am spoilt and ""have it good.""

"I am 21 almost 22 and I feel like I have not accomplished enough at my age. My age has been bothering me so much because everyone else my age is already ten steps ahead of me. I still live with my parents and it is so embarrassing and I am trying to save up to move out, but my social anxiety has caused my employer to cut my hours.",-
"I have never posted on here before but i feel like i need to. I no longer care about school or anything. I want to kill myself and i keep thinking about it and I am going to continue to think about it. I have been doing drugs lately to try and keep from going insane in this town. I am alone for most of my days. I do not really have parents to go home to, like my other friends. I am 16 in case anyone is wondering. I am alone every night and i am tired of being alone .. there is nothing here for me, no life. I am going to keep doing drugs and i hope i kill myself. I am sure my family cares, i know they do but they cannot help me. I do not want to see a doctor, i want to die. I have no motivation, i cannot concentrate in school. I am not planning on being around for a while. I cannot handle being alone anymore .. my dad is always with his girlfriend .. all the time, i never spend any time with my mom or dad .. it does not really matter now anyway, it is all too late.","I have never posted on here before but i feel like i need to.

"I am trying to go back to school after dropping out of college many years back, and I have got this real supportive boyfriend who wants to help me. Problem is, he is got this need for me to go out there and change the world. He keeps saying I need to be better than everyone in my class, and that I need to be hyper - prepared before I even start class. I do not mind boning up on the class material beforehand, but he wants to help me come up with theses and bring those to my undergrad profs for help, and he wants me to read a whole bunch of texts from my chosen field before the semester starts. He also wants me to study anatomy because, as he says ""anatomy does not really change"", so I can be the ""go to"" person with whom all my classmates will want to study. I am really bright and would like to make something out of myself, but he is got such high hopes and he wants me to do way too much way too soon. I do not even know for certain what I want to be at this point - getting back into the liberal arts program just seems like a good start towards deciding and acting. All this pressure from him is making it hard for me to even take the baby steps I need to take to make anything at all happen. When I try to tell him it is too much pressure, we wind up in a shouting argument (actually, I wind up doing most of the shouting - he just has this way of pressing my buttons.) I have spent my whole life as an inactive perfectionist, and all this from him just makes it hard to break free from that. Meanwhile, he is afraid that I am going to spend my life playing video games (a reasonable fear at the moment.) He keeps saying lately that I need to move out of childhood, but he wants to parent me. rrbleh.. is there some way to just move around him without having all these arguments, and without letting him pressure me?","I am really bright and would like to make something out of myself, but he is got such high hopes and he wants me to do way too much way too soon.

"My story, i have to get this off my chest. Life sucks Hello everyone, This is a post about my life basically, i just need to get this off my chest. Its a long post but i just have to do this. Let me introduce myself first. Currently im a 19yo boy who turns 20 in March, I live in Belgium (grammar will be bad sorry). I have 1 older brother, 2 loving parents who are still together. And oh yeahh i have a very cute pupper as well. Financially everything is fine. Basically a family some people only can dream for. I mainly play on nintendo consoles (switch, 3ds, gba, n64) and the MMORPG runescape (dont laugh I consider myself a extravert to my friends but an introvert when im talking to girls (lol) or strangers. I have always had a rough time fitting at school. Our elementary school was VERY SMALL, it only had 75 kids (including kindergarden). I was always the ""odd one out"", but because it was so small i had 1 friend. We played alot together and it was a ok time really. but when i was 5 most people around me started to notice that i made weird random noises. And that i made small movements with my shoulders (unnatural ones). Friends got annoyed, parents got annoyed, everyone got annoyed. Eventually my teacher screamed at me telling me to shut up, RIP ME. Eventually mom took me to a specialist and it turned out i have Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, if you youtube this you will get extreme cases where people shout fuck and ass, and move uncontrollably all over the place. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH ME. I think Tourette affected my life ALOT (it still does!!). I was always a really shy kid until i was 11, i started to accept my tourettes and was a happy 11yo. -- **HIGH SCHOOL** (from 12 to 18yo, its devided in 6 ""classes"". This is where the problems started, when i just started high school i was scared but excited like everyone. Unfortunately for me i got the SHITTIEST bullies in my class. I had no friends in year 1, they made fun of me becuz of my tourettes (i didnt tell them becuz they wouldnt understand). It got to a point where i just smacked someone on the head with a baseball bat. Teachers knew of my situation so we both got 1 week detention. I was ""depressed"" during that year, you know the teenage life, its hard. Year 2 they changed me to another class and they were OK. They didnt bully me but they didnt talk to me either. They just left me alone really, during those 2 years i had 1 friend who i talked with but he also had his own friends. So most of the time i was alone. But that friend had no common interests, so i ended up playing runescape all day, u can talk with other players there and i had plenty of friends in there. It felt awesome to have friends and i spent all my time there neglecting my studies. But somehow i passed the first 2 years lol. I thought year 1 was bad, but then i met year 3 (different school). I got bullied even more in this class, they called me names, ignored me, humiliated me in class and started bitching if they had to sit next to me. Luckily they never got fysical with me (idk if thats the right word). In the middle of that year I decided in the middle of the fucking winter (it was snowing) in morning to take the bus (mom was always home and it was near our house) and to step of early. Spent 2 hours in a small freezing cold chapel playing on my nintendo 3ds, go to my house after mom left and spend playing games in my room. After 3 days the school called, my mom found out. I was stuck and told her everything about the bullying, about me feeling like absolute shit and that i had no motivation to go to school. She let the teachers know, went to school, got me to a psychiatrist. The bullying stopped, but they still ignored me, i still hadnt any friends and i still didnt feel any better. I somehow survived the 4 next months and passed. If i had 1.1% lower in total i would have failed that year. The only way i felt better was with playing runescape. YEAR 4-6 IS IN THE SAME CLASS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE, in year 5 three people joined Year 4 kinda went the same as year 2 believe it or not. The classmates were ok, they didnt bully me, they talked to me when needed but that was it. I spent my time with some kids i met on the playground. But u know they were those kind of friends u just spent time with becuz nobody else is around. They never invited me to go to parties or to hang around or anything. This year was also the 1st year i told them about my Tourette Syndrome ( i got some damn weird looks at times and i didnt even realize i was making sounds). They understood, they acted more nice to me, i didnt feel left out so much but was still unhappy. And on runescape i got into a community (clan), made some good friends there. It was the only place in the word i was truly happy. Year 5, same class as last year. 3 people joined and 1 of them became a friend of mine. To be completely honest he is still one of my best friends today, but i come back to that later. Lets call him J, Ok so now i had a friend. We had a small group of 3 people now, S (other classmate who was nice to me), J and me. 2 others from another class joined the group somehow and i finally made some friends. We started going to parties and they invited me. Unlucky for me they dont play runescape and have different interests in gaming, thanks to this im not that close to them. But i was finally starting to be happy becuz i had friends. All the small things that bothered me (sitting alone, always last chosen at sports etc etc..), bothered me alot less becuz i was super happy i finally found something positive in my life. I survived year 5 and 6 fairly positive compared to year 1 and 3. We all graduated and college time arrived -- **COLLEGE** This was last year, so this is super recent. I decided to study ""orthopedagogie"", it doesnt have an english translation. Its working with mentally disabled people or troubled young people, stuff like that. Ofcourse I begged my parents for a student room, i wanted to have a great college life like in the movies! Everyone says its the best time of your life and you should enjoy it to the fullest. Oh boy i was so so dumb for believing it would be that easy. And ofcourse i also joined a society. Finally growing up like an adult and living alone, I WAS FREE. In my class i got along with most of them, we had some good laughs during breaks, went to our class etc.. but i was the only one who had a student room (unlucky). So ye that was that. In my society i tried making friends, but it didnt work out really. I missed some first important parties becuz i decided to go with some classmates (i still think to this day that this was a huge mistake), when i went to parties alone to make friends (because i realized my class was lame) they already a ""friend group"". I didnt know (and still dont) how to make contact with them and make friends. I was really really really lonely last year, i just spent all my time playing runescape, talking with my online friends. November 2016 i met someone and we became super super super super close. (he is american, not lovers just friends). We still talk to each other everyday. Man we even were planning to go to japan together but my mom wont let me. But coming back to that later. During the weekends i had my old friend group from highschool, we still hang out 2x per month, we still do. But they mostly spent time studying and hanging out with their uni friends. They didnt left me out or anything but i had lost alot of contact with them. I failed 50% of my courses, i decided to call it quits. I was happy that i could finally leave that student room. uni year 1 was HORRIBLE. I liked the study i was doing, so i decided to try it again but in a lower degree, its in a school for adults (18+). Its hard to explain but basically i ended up with 60% out of 20 people to be 30+ and have kids. It was class 1x a week and internship (idk if thats the right word) 2.5 days per week. I was working with adults who had a mental disability. Last year i never had internship, only class. It turns out that Orthopedagogie is not the study for me. I dont want to do this the rest of my life. I had officially quit november 2017. -- We finally arrived to the present time, thank you for the people that made it here. So here i am, a 19 year old boy (almost 20), wasted 1.5 years in uni, wasting parents money.. I have no idea what i want to study next.. The only study i consider doing is social work, luckily for me u can start in february. So i have to do some shitty job from november - february. I still have my highschool friends who i hang out with 2x per month? I have a loving brother and parents, good financial situation. I can earn some quick cash for 3 months and go back to study. But to be completely honest.. I DONT SEE THE FUCKING POINT. My whole life i have felt lonely, sometimes with a good reason, sometimes really without a reason. I have dealt with ""depression"" (not officially diagnosed), or atleast felt like i was. To be completelty honest. I feel like a sad little fucking sack of shit. What have i achieved in my life? Fucking nothing. I cant even think like a fucking normal person, people think im weird, i dont have logical sense. Everyday i have to force myself out of bed. Its been like this for so long now that im starting to get used to it. Even now that i dont have a job until feb, i simply dont have the strength to get out of bed. I sleep 12 hrs per day just so the day passes by faster. I dont feel like going out, i dont feel like talking to people. Runescape was always my escape, but i simply do not have the motivation to even play runescape . On the outside i still act normal, i laugh and act like everything is fine so my parents wont worry. Whenever i have a job they fire me because ""i work to slow"". Once i worked in a storage for a store and had to get the order from customers. You have to use ""common sense"" all the time, and they said i didnt have that enough for this job. This happened 3x.. Remember when i said that i have tourette syndrome, well i always told myself that it also does have a ""mental"" side to it. I can come across different then the ""normal person"", or use the wrong word in sentences to express myself. And i interpret things differently at times, i usually need to hear the explanation multiple times and they have to explain it very clearly. My parents just said im a slow learner but with ""hard work i get there"". This fucked me over so many times in life, and whenever i tell people/friends about the mental side of tourette they all have that expression on their face. The face of ""ohh that explains alot, but i also feel so sorry for you"". Im so fucking sick of it, im not even sure if this happens becuz of my tourette. Im really starting to think this is just all in my head and that im just retarded. (my iq is average tho). I often imagine myself having some disorder to make myself feel better, i really dont know what to do with myself. I feel like an absolute loser who cant even think like a normal person. Last 6 months i bought myself a nintendo switch + some games to cheer myself up. it gets me trough some days but in the end i still end up having no energy to get out of bed. BUT i feel like an arrogant asshole writing this, i have nothing to complain about.. Alot of people had the worst childhood, or had a traumatic experience.. I have a family many people can only dream of? financially im good. I have the chance to try studying again.. I HAVE NO REASON TO FEEL THIS WAY AND IT MAKES ME GO INSANE. Im having alot of negative thoughts, and i cant get them out of my head. I dont see the light in the end of the tunnel. (Not stuff like suicide or self cutting btw). As i said earlier i met someone a year ago trough rs. I can always talk to him, i never met him in person but we discord at times and message each other everyday. I feel more connected to him than my IRL friends. They have no same interests, other life goals.. How sad is that? Fkn someone i met online is my best friend? He is the only 1 that knows how i feel but he doesnt understand how i feel. He tries to support me, but it doesnt help. -- Im not making this post so everyone feels bad for me.. Im just so sick of life.. I dont know what to do.. My parents have their own problems and think im over exaggerating.. ""Grow up son? Everyone has to get a job"" ""Grow up for once"". But they dont know what it feel like to drag yourself trough the whole day 24/7 (atleast i hope they dont). They think im just lazy and dont want to work.. I feel isolated from the world and i cant get out of it. Ok god damnit im re-reading this post, at this point im just rambling.. Idk what i expect from posting this here.. Maybe its just to give my empty brain a boost.. I will just end this post now or i keep adding stuff.

"I often ponder the idea of giving up completely. Has anyone given up completely? How does it feel like? I have had extreme depression for 11 years. For as long as I can remember I have tried so hard to stay alive. There was a point in my life where I gave up. I remember my mom was beating me and I put up my hands to block the belt and I was crying. I remember after one of the times she struck me I started to think what if I gave up? And I just shut down. In that moment I stopped putting my hands up, stopped crying, and rolled into a ball while mom kept beating me for a few more minutes. For a few years after that I stopped caring about my appearance. I got so fat and I just kept eating and eating. I stopped caring about my grades and did not even try. I would just turn in a blank paper with my name on it. During high school I woke up and started to try again even though it was really hard. Since then I have not stopped. I regularly do thing I do not want to do in an effort to make it by. I get up at 5, I shower every day, I go to the gym, I do my homework, study, etc. Currently, I have been working my butt off to be able to join the military to get away from my parents. My depression is acting up so much, it is getting really hard to keep trying. I often find myself daydreaming and pondering how good/easy it would feel/be to just stop what I am doing and give up. Get in bed, stay in bed, go eat, eat some more, and more, finally not caring about my appearance and just not doing anything in general.","In that moment I stopped putting my hands up, stopped crying, and rolled into a ball while mom kept beating me for a few more minutes.

"We were all given about five minutes to decipher what the fuck this meant. Now, Mr. Runge had a reputation for being a tough teacher. He would not let you get away with ANYTHING. If you fell asleep in his class because you were out all night in some cornfield with a bonfire and a bottle of Jack, he would kick your desk in such a way that your head would fly upward at warp speed and your hangover would instantly get very very bad, and then suddenly disappear. Mr. Runge had some freaky special power that students could not tap into. I knew what the acronym stood for. But that is only because my high school boyfriend was a year ahead of me and gave me a heads up on how the first day with the Jolly Green Giant would play out. ""He is going to write this on the board, make you feel incredibly stupid and then it will be over."" TINSTAAFL, pronounced TinStaffel. There Is No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. Runge went on to explain that ""free"" did not exist. The ""free"" lunches at college tours were paid for when your parents registered you were charged a ""service"" fee. Or, more on my level, Clinique never REALLY has a ""Free Gift with Purchase"". Because, you see..you have to make the purchase, dumb ass! And they over charge every other product just enough so that you are really paying for your ""free"" gift. This burst my bubble. Because now, whenever I take something marketed as free, I know I am paying some sort of overhead or some poor schmuck is working extra hard so that I can get 2.5 ounces more of my favorite shampoo for the price of the regular size! You would think that I would have held on to this knowledge while looking for apartments. While scanning the ads, I bypassed the ones that used words like ""full of character"", because I knew that meant dump and ""TLC needed"", because I knew that meant dump. The one I honed in on boasted country living, quiet, serene, pond, lots o' land and everything included! I love where I live. I cannot say it enough. If I did not think raccoons would eat me at this hour, I would jump on top of the roof and scream to the surrounding hills ""I love you and all your coniferous smells and the creatures you shelter!"" (Yeah, apparently the rooftop would make me a tad wordy.) My landlords are awesome people. Salt of the earth. Nice, down-home, trusting folk. And, as the contract for country people reads, ""Coon Hounds Must Be Owned and Bred"". I had never seen a breed of this type until I moved here. The momma dog was so sweet and gentle and quiet. She was quite the fatty too! Then suddenly she was not. And in her pen were ten little squeaky pups, eyes shut tight, blindly falling into food and water dishes, only to be rescued by momma. Cute, no? Who does not love puppies?? (If you bring Jackson up, I will have to cut you.) It is been about month. Puppies have found their voices. All ten of them. And even the momma is begging for a release. Tigger is in the window, constantly doing a head count to make sure everyone is in their place and not a single one wanders off into oblivion. He is exhausted. Momma is exhausted because at night she performs a constant howl that cracks my heart. She is begging to be released from those needy fucking kids for at least ONE night of respite. And I am exhausted. Because momma will not shut up and deal with her fate and every time a puppy so much as peeps, gaymancat is all over my head doing a get-up-because-they-might-run-into-traffic-and-get-hit-by-one-of-the-four-cars-that-pass-by-here-at-night dance. So I get up. I get a drink. And the howling stops. And Tigger falls asleep in my space on the bed.

"In a bad headspace after a breakup with someone who finally made me feel like things would be okay It is been a week since I returned from a six month exchange program overseas. There, I ended a 2y relationship with an addict, who I still cared for but could not love anymore. Then, of course, I fell in love with someone. We were inseparable for the six months. As I struggle with depression, anxiety and schizoaffective disorder, it has not been the easiest for him. We planned to end our relationship and continue as friends, but just could not bear to at the departure gates. We decided to try a long distance relationship, but after a week, he is had enough of me. He has his own problems, and we live 20 hours apart with a 12h time difference, so I do not blame him at all. I do however carry a lot of resentment for myself for being so down in the past week and pushing him. I used to be really sociable, but a multitude of issues have led me to slowly isolate myself from people. I still have friends, but they either do not actually gaf or they have their own problems and I do not want to add on to their burdens. It is also very difficult for me to meet people without any alcohol or drugs to calm the anxietysomething I am trying to stay away from as my addiction problems have led me to the psych ward. Besides, how much can friends be there for you? It is you alone in your bed staring at the ceiling til noon the next day for days on end (I have had terrible insomnia since coming home). I am still on school break, cannot really occupy my mind by going outside to meet friends or take a part time job or just walk around due to anxiety and psychosis, and all the things I used to watch/do to cheer myself up (music, slam poetry, writing, youtube, netflix, games) I have associated very strongly with him as we have very similar habits. So anything that could make me pass the time makes me sad. I have loved and lost many times and I know it gets better eventually, but currently it gets very very dark in my mind and I am not sure what I can do to survive in the meantime. I am in a very bad place and feel very anhedonic and suicidal thoughts are back (having been accumulated from all these problems).

"I have been having a difficult time lately. In addition to my mental state of disarray, I have a medical condition that can affect my mood. My medication has changed lately; my body has not caught up the difference yet. The last few days have been particularly bad, especially at night. The familiar sensation lurks again on my upper leg. Scissors. Half-dozen lines -- my usual, though in the past I would sometimes keep cutting until my self-hatred was momentarily spent. Pressure on the blade to force the skin to gape slightly and bleed more. I am not proud. I knew it was not the best way to cope. I did at least take the precautions of using a sharp blade, knowing that a jagged blade could leave a jagged wound, and of lavish aftercare. I washed it out with rubbing alcohol, which causes renewed bleeding but was necessary to keep everything clean and infection-free. Covered everything with a jumbo Band-Aid, the kind kids put on skinned knees, and have not dared to look since. Afterward, I was afraid that I was back to my old ways. I told myself in near-hysterics that this was strictly a one-time backslide. The surprising part is that I believed myself. This does not make me a cutter again.

My situation will improve. My body chemistry will even out. It is better not to cut, but I am not a bad person even if I do cut. The words are stupidly simple. I do not care. They are my magic that keeps me going.","I have been having a difficult time lately.

"I want to pay off my debt then kill myself. I came from a really poor family, worked hard during primary and secondary school. Got a scholarship for college which paid me 10k a year as well as covering my school fees. Gave parents the money, it paid for the bills as well as my siblings is school fees. Thought life was good, studying what i love. However, i got bullied until i cant take it anymore and requested a change of class, the school rejected my request. I then requested to take a semester off school, but the contract for the scholarship states that i have to complete school by 3 years or the contract will be terminated. Failed a module and i have to extend my time in college by a year, which caused my scholarship to be terminated. Which in turn placed me in a 30k debt. Now, i do not have money to pay for school, so i had to leave. Im out without any qualifications except for a secondary school cert, with the organisation that offered me the scholarship requesting 1k per month for installments. I have always looked forward to my dream job, i was so close, i volunteer every weekend to get experience from that job. Now it feels like everything is taken from me. I appealed to have my scholarship reinstated 3 times, explaining the issues that i had, giving them the medical reports from my doctors, bringing up the volunteer work i did. But on the latest attempt, i got a call saying that they never planned to accept my appeal. It really feels like everything is taken from me. I feel like just working to pay off my debt so as to not burden my family as the debtors will go for them if i die now. There is nothing to look forward to anymore. 3 years of suffering incoming","Got a scholarship for college which paid me 10k a year as well as covering my school fees.

I Could Use Some Support Right Now Yesterday my best friend of five years attempted to kill their self. I am currently being blown away by school (grad school if it really matters). I do not know what to think at all. This is midterm week and most my profs are understanding but the one class I am worried about the prof gave me the option of writing and being stuck with whatever mark I get or not writing and the weight being shifted onto my final but I need the feedback to decide if I am going to even stay in the course because it is incredibly difficult. It just feels like nothing is going my way currently and it is so hard to study or focus. side note; another prof let me write as told them (like I did the other) that I wanted it as a distraction and said that if I did bad they would shift the weight to my final.,side note; another prof let me write as told them (like I did the other) that I wanted it as a distraction and said that if I did bad they would shift the weight to my final.
"I think I may have been on this forum (it looked different) back in 2002 when I had a major bout with depression and anxiety due to some serious financial worries. I have always been prone to this I guess, but I am starting to figure out that it is big, nasty life-changes that trigger it. Well, here I go again. This time it is relationship-related. My wife and I are on brink of divorce. I found out almost a year ago that she has been emotionally involved with another man, and was no longer ""in-love"" with me. We somehow muddled through the next several months, even though I found out it was still going on, we kept ""trying"" anyway, and things were still tolerable and ok, I guess. (We still shared same bed, got affectionate, cuddled and even made love). About 3 weeks ago, I discovered that it still had not ended, and they were actually conspiring on getting together in March. Well, all hell broke loose and things got worse than ever. I am now in a separate room, sleeping on a single bed, and I am miserable. I resumed Wellbutrin when this all started last spring (I took Wellbutrin for about 9 months when I had my episode in 2002), and have been taking it since. But since this really bad turn of events, I knew I could not take it, and to be honest, even before I discovered again, my therapist told me that I need to revisit my doctor and prescriptions because I have got some serious anxiety issues. So now I just started Zoloft (25mg/day) in addition to the Wellbutrin. I do not know how things are going to turn out. I am in ""limbo"" while I give her ""time and space to figure things out."" The Zoloft I think started to kick in today, but not in a good way. I am actually feeling MORE depressed when I came in this morning..I almost broke down crying in front of my computer -argh! My mood swings are horrible. All I can think about is going home and crawling into my bed and taking an Ambien, even though I hate that bed and want to be in the big bed with my wife. I almost wish at times that she would just say, ""That is it, we are done"", so I can know what is going on and just move on with my life. I may end up single and lonely anyway, but at least I will have the opportunity to look for someone else. Right now I feel like a prisoner, being starved of basic human needs, like hugs, touches, affection. (Does not that sound lame from a guy?? ) Well, anyway, here I am..here for the ride..","I do not know how things are going to turn out.

"When I was 10, my babysitter molested me many times over the course of 1 year. Many of the times she would make me dress up in girl is clothes and she would take me out that way. I am 30 now. I still cannot have sex. I still cannot go out into public without having severe anxiety attacks. And when I am at home, I find myself cross dressing sometimes. The shrinks with whom I have spoken have never been helpful so I am hoping this post finds someone who may have some idea of what I went through and am going through now.

"Despair is the normal state of my life I have not drank though. I have no urge to drink. I just want to stop. Stop moving. Just end. I keep picturing myself walking out on my job. Getting kicked out of my apartment. Living in my car. That being repossessed. And eventually ending up in a gutter, wrapped in a a blanket but still freezing to death. Just frozen. Not moving, not willing and thus not physically able to bring myself to it. There is no point to it. It is never enough. Not matter how much you work, how hard you try, it does not work. I do not get ahead. Everything I am, someone is better at it. And anything I do, I can be replaced. And if I do find success by some small measure, I acclimate and find myself just as miserable. Nothing has changed. I did a long big post a few weeks ago about all the supposed progress I made. It does not bring me happiness anymore. I am so fucking far behind I will never get to a place where I feel safe, so fuck it. I just want to exit. I am sick of being a cog in a machine I never wanted to help built or run. Life is just work, sleep, and distract. I am not sure why I am writing it. I do not know how I found the motivation.","Despair is the normal state of my life I have not drank though.

"I am just waste of sperm Where to start? Well I only life with my mom in shit apartment(my dad was alcoholic ect.) My mom is in debt because of school.. and has been in dept all her life. So all my 17 years we are poor. Sometimes we live without electricity because she cannot pay in time. In school when there is a road trip to somewhere I do not go and say I do not want to go because I cannot afford. (sometimes I want to go but most of the time I do not because of my mental illness.. ) Sometimes i do not have nothing to eat for dinner . All my 17 years I only eat 2 different food at home..potatoes or pasta. Because we are poor my teeth are really bad of eating all the shit junk food. I just do not smile anymore. Soo another problem is I am stupid just plain stupid I had to repeat classes 2 times and now I just do not care anymore because i will probably kill myself. I have low self-esteem. I SOO FCKING BAD HATE MYSELF IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS. So I have got soo many mental problems like ocd, bipolar, depression, anxiety, social anxiety sometimes I have panic attacks, I have signs of autism and im likely to be asexual. I have only 2 friends who I start to rarely see because I stay at home all day in bed . I have Phimosis too. So my life is just great. In my life I have never got what I wanted because we are poor.. soo I just hate my life nothing gives me happiness. I do not really see the point in living tbh. Nothing just inteests me. We are just born to die. Nice. I would prefer to die before my mom dies because I just could not bear with that.. Without my mom i would not survive in this lazy shit world!

"Well, a little update then. For those who do not know me that well yet, (which is everybody I suppose) I am the 20 (almost 21) year old that chose to take a break from school, due to pff what will it be? Anxiety, depression, health problems regarding sleep/energy. I tried it again at some point, but after 2 weeks found myself to be, not cured yet. I figured it had to end, so I went looking for help. Social worker, well that is all nice and stuff, but not too helpful. Then the official psychiatrists. Well let is pick up from there; the first one, in the Adolescents department directed me to another shrink after the first intake meeting, my help question; not sure. But something was keeping me from being able to fit in the system. I also had concentration problems but she did not want to dig into that. So this new shrink, on a different department, made me fill in some forms and we had some talks (2) and well, apparently the concentration problem IS a big issue and causing a lot of damage as well as my past (divorced parents, being bullied all my life etc etc.) Okay fine, so I says; maybe I need something to help me sleep? And she suggested I go see my house doctor and ask for sleeping medicines. Which I got, and used for two weeks now and ..nothing. Well, the first 2 days were good, the 2 after that were less good, and I do not even remember the ones after that. I woke up automatically, and sometimes sleep was okay. But after 2 weeks I am still SO tired everyday, it is killing me. I try and keep up a new rhythm, but it is so exhausting and I feel like doing all sorts of happy things but I just do not have the energy and then I go do it anyway and I end up so hurt and tired. Now, I cannot take the medicines for more than two weeks, so today was going to be my last. Well, I sort of should have read the booklet I got with it before use. It said I should not take them EVERY day but every other day, and like I do not know, it says it builds up and stays in your body. Well, I am fine do not worry. They warned about some side effects, but I seem to have been okay. However, the side effects include ALL the things I already suffered from BEFORE even taking the darn medicines!! So it is been a complete and utter waste. This one day, I tried sleeping without medicines, and I just could not..just, cannot fall asleep. So yeah, I had that talk with yet another shrink today, and now he wants me to see some other person. And he thinks I SHOULDN'T take sleeping medicines. So like, ARGH, people keep telling me opposite things, and now they want me to see this person, who will help me fill in my days and get organized?? That is all cool and well and all, but I got there myself already. I figured it all out before I even started seeing these ""professionals"" and now they are telling me what I already came up with on my own?? It is another 3 week wait. And I do not know anymore. I am confused about all this, and beginning to think it is been a huge mistake in the first place. And now that it is Spring again, I am feeling sort of happy. So depression is still here, but, I do not notice it much..or do I? I am still feeling so alone and my family still does not get me..I just want out, I just want to be away from here, which brings us back to the original problem. I am so annoyed, and after this, today is just going to be another day that I just do not do anything useful.. Sure I want to go back to school, but it takes time..I have some time, then again I do not.. I had so many plans, and ARGH this sleeping problem, which is going to be my main focus now, is just so darn annoying. I could listen to countless pieces of advice, but in the end, it is just no good to me.. Even the stupid sleeping medicines do not work..And every time I go see a shrink about one problem, they point me to someone else, and then another problem bothers me and they send me back but that still did not fix my first problem. I am like, fine I will go fix this darn problem myself then. (I really feel like cursing, but I will not because it is not proper so I will release some rage when I am done here, but just know that I am really upset and annoyed). After all, it was me who had to fix everything all my life right? So I might as well start now.. haha such a laugh, I will procrastinate till the day I die.. So very tired. I cannot do a thing.. ugh, I am so sick of it. I want to go sleep now, but I just know I will wake up late in the evening and will not be able to sleep tonight.

"Law of Attraction is bullshit. Also hard work does not pay off. Everything in life is based on chance and luck only. Our society preaches the fiction of hard work paying off because we need most expandable people to work hard, so that the rest can just chill and live off their backs. Also every fucking motivational coach and self-help guide is a fucking scam. Focusing your goals, working hard and putting effort in to achieve them? Yeah, tell that to people with terminal diseases or people living in poverty without the chance to ever get better, people dying of famine or living in war zones. Tell that to the legions of people who did not make the cut and never will. Yeah, tell them they just ""did not work hard enough"", ""did not want it enough"" while you completely ignore how fucking lucky you got to be in the privileged position you are in.

"I always wanted to go to the therapy but my very huge and overprotective gossip-loving family made this impossible for me to do Not only that but even a little hypothetical talk about it would instantly gain unnecessary panic like attention and after several phone calls to friends, family members with something like *""Hey Clara, he wants to go to the therapist. Is this normal? Which one should we call? Do you know anyone? Ask John please!""* And next day there will be several people touching my hand and saying ""Hey are you fine?"" Making it feel like something is wrong with me when I just want to talk to a professional in person without feeling like a babe. How do I know? Because my sister was depressed once and I have seen how everyone reacted to it. You see, my family is never changing mentality is ""we need to fight together! We are there for you (goddamn Fairy Tail guild or something)"". I do not blame them and I bet there are people who would exchange everything only to be with someone as supportive. But I have always hated attention so much since I remember my self as a kid. Ironically enough I have had the biggest birthday parties in the town to boost this 'weird' hate. Doing it secretly will be risky because I actually work in my family is business as well so my tight schedule and the fact that my town is pretty small makes this almost impossible. And if someone finds out I secretly go to talk to a doctor it will have even worse reaction than just straight out telling them. Maybe I am overreacting and have too much pride in me or no balls to admit to my family but sometimes I wish I could get invisible for just a week to sort my inner problems out. Sorry If this feels like I am trying to make it harder for you guys to make some suggestions. It is way more complicated than that I just wanted to let it out. I have read some posts here and some of them were so so dark that my problems actually fade away a bit and I felt better because I said to my self *""yo.. you are being a bitch right now, look at these people suffering here, you are not even close!""* (do not know if I am being terrible for healing my little wounds by reading how other people suffer). Anyways, Idk why I have not visited this sub earlier, as I type these last words I already feel better because it is the first time I am doing something like this.

"Journal Entry - 12:23AM Monday, December 4th, 2017 Just thought I would share my thoughts from last night. I occasionally lurk Reddit looking for a relatable story, so I figured I would share some of my own thoughts. I do not want a job. The hardest part of having a job is talking. It is bad enough that I have to make eye contact. Having to speak on top of that can be nerve wrecking. Meeting new people is also tough. It is even tougher when you are the new one. Who are these people? Do I even want to know you? Are you going to try and get to know me? Am I going to allow it? Customers are easier to deal with, but just a drag to have to deal with. It can be monotonous. Often, it is annoying. But all the while, I just feel drained. There are good days at work. But there are also bad days. And those bad days make the lasting impression, in my experience. I am thankful for those good days. But the bad days remind me that I want better for myself. I am tired of working in restaurants. I am tired of wearing a stupid hat my hair can barely fit under. I am tired of repeating phrases I am told to repeat. I am tired of seeing the disgusting process of how people is shitty food is prepared. I am tired of cooking, something I enjoy, feeling soulless. Historically, preparing a meal and feeding someone is a virtuous act, at least to me. The commoditization of it is a bit of a shame. I detest consumerism, generally speaking. Customers are not my favorite people. Along with restaurants, I hope to avoid customer interaction at my next job. I really do not want any job. When it comes to time &amp; energy vs. money, I am all for the money until I find out what I have to do. Then my my time &amp; energy feels more valuable. Because it is more valuable.","Journal Entry - 12:23AM Monday, December 4th, 2017 Just thought I would share my thoughts from last night.

I am not sure if trigger warnings are common place here, but before you read on I would like to say warn that this mentions suicide.

I am struggling to keep it all together. I just want to cry all day. But I do not want my kids to see my crying. Everyone around me is just carrying on like normal. I have a history of depression, I am currently in therapy and on medication. I feel like my family is wrapping me in cotton wool. When I first found out how it happened, I obsessed over articles that described the process they would have went through while dying. I kept wondering what they were feeling in that moment.. if during those last moments they had regret. Then I kept tormenting myself with the what if? I have been able to stop doing those. But now.. I just want to be a sloth. I want to sit on the couch and watch TV all day. All motivation I had prior to last week has just gone. I have never had anyone this close to me die.

I know it is just a glorified hook up app for the most part but the other night I matched with a really cute girl who was way out of my league and we started talking, one thing leads to another and next thing I know we are up to after 2am talking about Pokmon of all things. I feel like there is a connection there so i ask her out and she says yes. It took alot to do this and it honestly made my month as the last few have been pretty meh. We kept talking the next day and that evening she did not reply to one my texts, I tried to think nothing of it because it was not really a question or anything and tried to restart the conversation but nothing again. This morning I said Hi and she replied Hey back and then I asked her what she was up to and she just did not reply again. I do not blame her if she is not interested, that is fair enough it happens. She was sending x is up until she stopped texting back though and its not something i thought i was being naive about thinking she was interested in me but maybe i was wrong. I kinda just wish i knew where i went wrong. I just feel so unattractive and like there is something wrong with me. I know this probably sounds really petty and unimportant but it really hurts and I just needed to vent.","She was sending x is up until she stopped texting back though and its not something i thought i was being naive about thinking she was interested in me but maybe i was wrong.

"Does anyone else feel like life is maybe too long? I do not know what it is, but just having to face so many days of the same things, even if you switch it up once in a while, it is all so boring and monotonous. I find it difficult keeping myself entertained. I feel like I am at a party where I was having fun at first, but now things are starting to die down and I just want to go home, aka be dead already. Just a thought I have been having.

You: haha Stranger: hopping? Stranger: not sure You: ok, but would not u be extremely depressed and miserabl all the time. how could u find joy in such an existence?

Stranger: id say just keep going, if things seem bad now just realize how many times youve reached a breaking point in your life, for whatever reason, and that youre still here lol Stranger: also, just keep trying new things, and doing whatever, because what does it matter anyways? Stranger: and if you seriously feel depressed, consider going to a doctor/therapist, as there could be less serotonin in your brain that the average person Stranger: is that helpful at all lol You: yes, it is nice to hear someone else who has thought about these things. and who can give an honest opinion Stranger: i believe in u man Stranger: u still there?

"My mom asked me:""What held you back"" Today I went down to the city,I walked around for a while I went down to the river and stood there for a while than I went up to the bridge and stared down.I ran away from home.I did not have my phone.My parents did not know where I was.We had an argument for at least 8 hours and I just had enough.I had depression since I was 9(I am 15).My mom always said I was just imagining it.When I got home they started yelling at me(rightfully so,I was away for 2 hours they were about to call the police,but I had to be alone for a while).An hour ago my mother asked me why did not I just jump off if I have a ""missarable"" life.

"I am a daca recipient and I fucking hate it. I was born in Mexico and brought to the US when I was 3. This of course means I am one of those ""nasty illegals"" everyone seems to hate. My goal has always been success. Ever since I was a kid I daydreamed of owning a mansion with fancy gates, a huge lawn, a big pool. This was always my goal. I was not going to accept living in poverty like my parents or having an ""average"" life. So I worked hard for it. I was always top of my class, I was on the dean is honor list in college, I started (and failed) my first few businesses, joined clubs, went to a lot of events to meet people, and landed an internship. I was even in the middle of starting my next business. I also got my credit score up to almost 800 and started funding my retirement/investment account. Because my whole life has been focused on success, I attempted suicide a few times when I found out I was illegal and could not even go to college in high school. Obviously they all failed. However in 2012, the year before I graduated, Obama passed daca. Because I had been here since I was a toddler, was going to finish school, and did not have even a single misdemeanor, I was able to get a social security number, a work permit, a driver is license, open investment accounts, and received protection from deportation. Now Trump has ended it. The final decision will be made in early August, but it is most likely going to be rescinded. What am I supposed to do then? Just fucking accept losing everything? Everything I worked towards will have been for nothing. Even if daca continues, am I supposed to just keep living in fear of it ending again forever? I am losing all my fucking hair stressing over this. I have had a cold for months that has not gone away, and everything hurts. I cannot even talk to anyone about this. Everyone just tells me to man up and work some shitty job picking fruit in the fields. No one understands that I actually have goals in life. I refuse to accept a life where I work 60 hours a week, breaking down my body, for $30k a year with no room for advancement and living in fear every day. I have never been fond of life in the first place. The only thing that ever gave me happiness was growing my net worth, and pretty soon I will not even be able to do that. Why should not I end it all at that point? That is it. I needed to rant. I am sorry if I sound like a spoiled brat. TLR: I rely on daca to have an even somewhat decent life. It is being taken away. I am losing everything.","I was not going to accept living in poverty like my parents or having an ""average"" life.

Is it obvious when you have depression? I wonder if I have some form of mild depression or I just have low self esteem. I became a mute quite a few years ago after acouple of events that got me down. I think it may have been catatonia. But I am not 100%. Ever since then I do not feel like I got back to my normal self. I am a lot shyer and I do not have much luck socially or romantically or in my career. The best way to put it would be I lost my personality. I can really beat myself up sometimes because I hate myself. When something bad happens I really start self loathing quite badly. I do not feel suicidal. I hate myself more than I hate my life. I blame my lack of success on myself. I do not enjoy things as much as I used to so I have no real hobbies. I do not think I am likable and I cannot even pass interviews these days. I lost my personality and that is why I hate myself. I am unrecognisable to who I used to be so I isolate myself a lot more these days. I do not think significantly depressed but I wonder if mild depression is the cause of my loss of personality? Or could it be something else that caused me to change? All I know is I have lost a lot of confidence and I am always beating myself up about it,"Ever since then I do not feel like I got back to my normal self.

"I would like to say hello to everyone, I have bipolar and was doing a bit of research into my illness, which I have not done before as I have always denied having the illness. I do have funny story to tell. A few years ago now I lost the plot and lost my home wife and children as a result. Not that funny but at the time I did not know I had bipolar. New life spending loads of money racing up the career ladder (on a High) I meet this fantastic girl. We went on holidays together had some great times. After a year or two I moved in with this girl gave up my good job and planned a future for us both marriage extra. There was one thing holding us back we both hard bipolar and never told each other about or illness as we thought this could change everything. As you can imagine if she when on a high I went on a low , and when I went on a high starting companies and buying things I could not afford she would go on a low. Our relationship did not last for much longer as she would self harm and I would attempt suicide. It was not until I went into hospital that it all came out in the open. We are still friends but both agree that two bipolar people do not match. My doctor did smile and we did laugh about it. Anyway I am new and just want to say hi to everyone.","I would like to say hello to everyone, I have bipolar and was doing a bit of research into my illness, which I have not done before as I have always denied having the illness.

Do you know how it feels to go through the cycles of feeling nuts / alone to gaining a semblance of normalcy? Well, that makes me angry. I get angry when I start to get happy. I get angry when I start to feel sad. I get angry when someone shows me love. I get angry when things go well. I get angry when things do not go well. I get angry, I get angry, I get angry.

I am like a ghost of myself. When I speak, what comes out is all wrong. I am nothing like I used to be. I am scared, I am torn, and I am alone. My old friend looks to me: you are so great. You are here for me and you are strong. Blah blah blah .. in reality we are just too lost souls traveling the highways alone. If I see you, I see you. But you are not going be there for my funeral. You will probably not even know when and where it is. You will sleep through it and read about in the newspaper or some shit. You will cry to the person next to you, and that will be that.

"I am 30 years old and I have been living with depression as long as I can remember (I think it started when I was 10) . However I was diagnosed with major depression only 2 years ago. Since then I have experienced recurrent episodes of depression. I thought that knowing what was my problem, accepting it, taking medication, seeing a therapist, working on cognitive therapy, would make my life better. Unfortunately, I still have those major episodes of depression where I am hopeless and sad, and the only solution available to stop the pain seems to kill myself. No fun in there. I know that depression is part of who I am, I know it is part of my life and I accept it. What I cannot accept is the fact that it is not going to be easier. I need hope.

"this is my first post , so bare with me. I have been married a year and just found out some interesting news about my husband. He told me that the man he calls dad is not really his father. He told me that his mother never told him until he was 13 years old, and had to go to court to change his name. I always wondered why, he and his father never got along. His mother will not tell him who his real father is. I feel I need to help him find him, so he can close the door, and get answers to all his questions. My husband does not like to talk about feelings, he was raised in a family where no one talked about feelings and if you had a problem you kept it to yourself. I was raised totally opposite. In ways this has left him hurt and confused. He feels like he does not belong sometimes. He told me sometimes he would like to know who his dad is and other times he could care less. But, it seems like it is always on his mind, when family issues come about. The man that raised him, is an issue all to his own, he is very abusive, physically, and mentally. He is always telling my husband, he is wrong and will never be able to be successful. He has heard that all his life, but he has never believed it - he is strong and has a good heart - It just hurts me when I see him lash out. He takes all his problems out on me, I now understand why. I have not told him, but I found out who his father is. All I have is a name. I want to tell him but do not know if I should. I do not want his mother not to talk to him if he knows - I am very confused - I am right in the middle and do not want anyone to get hurt. Looking for advice - or someone that can relate to this.","He told me that the man he calls dad is not really his father.

"I have already posted on this forum but I never really introduced myself. So here goes: My name is Amy, and I am 24 years old. I have two beautiful daughters, ages 5 and 3. I am also raising my little brother, who is 1. I have suffered from anxiety attacks since I was 16 and became seriously depressed about 2 years ago. I was hospitalized once .. when the doctor put me on Zoloft. Since then I have tried Effexor XR and Klonopin (worked for 8 months) and am supposed to be trying Wellbutrin and Buspar now (scared to start them). I self - harm when things get too hard for me, and have scars covering much of my left arm due to cutting. I was recently dismissed from my therapy / psychiatrist due to missed appointments .. and I do not know if I am going to find another one yet. I think about just letting go sometimes. Nothing really helps anyways. The one thing that depresses me the most is my fear of spending the rest of my life alone. Men seem to think I am only good for one thing .. and I guess I agree. I hate that I go from being okay .. sometimes for weeks at a time .. and then everything falls apart. My family supports me .. sometimes. At least, my mom lets me crash at her house when things are real bad. My mom and my sister try to be there .. but they get tired of me. I cannot say I had a bad childhood .. I cannot remember my childhood. I went under hypnosis .. had a vision of my dad and became extremely afraid. I never had a chance to go back and find out why. Missed too many appointments. My dad was accused of being abusive (to my mother) and having a violent temper .. and of molesting my sister and I. Do not remember. My dad says my mom left us for two years when I was 2 or 3 years old and was always drunk. Do not remember. I spent much of my teen years drunk / high and being promiscuous .. let is just say even my mother knew I had a reputation. Why? Do not know. I have never felt like I belonged .. and the past few years I have felt like I have not really been living. Disassociation, I suppose. I am usually moody, never have any energy, and have started and quit school 3 times to date. Never accomplished anything but getting my GED .. and the sad thing is .. I am smart. I live day to day .. never knowing if it will be a good day or a bad day. My daughter had missed a lot of school because I cannot seem to get her there by 12 in the afternoon. My mom says she will help .. but I know I am on my own. Neither of my daughters' father is are any help. My dad left my little brother with me in November, sends down some money every month.. and has not seen him since. Some days I feel like I am on top of things .. most days I feel like things are on top of me .. and smothering me. I have started writing my daughters a letter letting them know everything I want them to know when they are older .. just in case I am not around. I cannot say for sure this will not beat me one day, and I want to be prepared. I love my kids .. but also believe with all my heart they would be better off without me. Sure .. they love me and I am their mommy .. but not all mommies are good mommies and not all mommies deserve to raise children. Love is not always enough .. because God (is he even real?) knows I would die / kill for my girls. I know the answers to nothing and have so many questions. This is my life .. Scared to be alone .. but I always am. I read this somewhere and it sums up how I feel: I am not hungry .. but I am starving. I am not tired .. but I am exhausted. I am not bleeding .. but I am dying. So hi to everyone who is fighting the same fight ..

Yes I have a supportive family and yes I have friends that are willing to listen to my bullshit, but dose that really lessen my inner turmoil and trouble with my mind, so I have to be fucking stabbed by my own brother to make it legit ?

Did all kids struggle with basics in school ?! Did every kid end up feeling alone no Mather what he or she did there entire life ?! Did they have to feel so alone and unconnected ?!

Do not you think at eats at me almost every waking moment of my existence?! Am I really that defective that I am just not good enough ?!

"I was first officially diagnosed as depressed when I was twelve, and had been depressed for two or three years before that, following the death of my younger sister. It took six years before I found an effective medication. During the time I was depressed, I was completely antisocial, had no friends, and was completely oblivious to the outside world. Now I am eighteen, and I feel like I have missed a decade of social development. I have no friends, and no idea how to make any. It is all well and good to say just be friendly, but I do not know what that means! I cannot make small talk, because I have no understanding of fashion, boys, make up, any of the things girls my age are meant to talk about, if that is what they are meant to talk about. Most of the things I know about other people my age I get from books and television, and I have no idea how accurate they are. Please, I really need help. I have just started attending a 'normal' school (as opposed to a hospital school) for the first time since 8th grade, and I would like to have friends, I just do not know how to go about it.","I have no friends, and no idea how to make any.

"I let out a belly laugh when I thought about the future. I could not plan the next 3 months, then realized how much of a depressed piece of shit I am that I laughed at myself for thinking I deserve a future. I am so pathetic. Half of me finds it genuinely funny that A. I deserve a future. B. I will not kill myself in the next 3 months. The other half cannot stop wondering how deep of a depression I am in and if I will ever get out.

Can somone help me find a documentary on mental illness? I saw this older documentary about this baseball player who had a mental breakdown awhile back. He was not famous. It was on youtube. Does this sound familiar? He had a beard and so did his dad. He lived in a mental hospital. It was like from the 80s I am pretty sure.,Can somone help me find a documentary on mental illness?

"For the first time in my life i liked this girl and when she left life around me does not make sense. Why does this pain happen to people This is my first time and please i need some answers on what to do, why does life work this way, i fucking hate that things had to go wrong this fucking way. My depression is taking over me and my family is worried about me. For the first time in high school i liked this girl for about 7 months and during that time we became best friends and i always thought she would like me if i cared for her and treated her right. i always acted the same way as her and found out we thought the same sometimes. We always talked to each other including late night till 2 or 3 am and we knew everything about each other and we always were with each other but instead she liked some asshole who did not like me and always kept lying about me to her. She never believed what he said about me but chose to love him and be with him more and they always were with each other after class and it made me jealous and angry on why she would do this. One day i invited her to some place with her and my friends but she decided to also want to take the asshole and i got frustrated and ended our friendship. she got angry at me and decided to leave too. but one day the asshole decided to leave her because of a fight they had and she starts crying to me on the phone and i try to help her get over him but it hurts me when she says she loves this person who kept lying to her about me and other things and he was known to be a bad person and she only dated one guy before but he was super nice and i did not understand why she liked him and she said she did not either, it was only that she felt happy around him. She is such a pretty girl and most of the guys in the school agree and thought me and her were dating but they never knew she really liked this asshole and during the time they hanged out she kept asking me if they were right for each other and she said she would separate from him but she did not listen to me. Instead they got closer and me and this asshole got into more fights with each other but she would rather not say anything and still be with him. Now she is actually separating from him after all this time. Why did she do this to me after everything we have been through because i treated her way better but she did this to me and i dont know should i go back to her after what she did. Its been 2 weeks and i have not talked to her since then and my mind has been thinking of ways to beat myself up because of this problem. Everyone knows im depressed but at this point i could not care and im losing my mind and i just need some answers of why she liked this asshole but not me.","For the first time in high school i liked this girl for about 7 months and during that time we became best friends and i always thought she would like me if i cared for her and treated her right.

I am sick and tire of letting my depression get in the way all the time I am sick of being shy secluded and uninterested I am sick of letting my depression define me!

"Suicide is a constant thought though I dont feel a desire to do it I have people who I care about and who care about me and I know deep down that Id never consider suicide a valid option but it seems that I cannot help but constantly think about it throughout the day, every day.

"Reddit is not a nice place for someone who suffers depression. I think it is funny how sometimes we take internet so seriously. I have no idea why the rudness of some totally strange person, probably between 12-16, made me so.. down. I think it is because I use Reddit a lot as someway of just..

"My grandma is dying and life does not stop So I work full-time and go to grad school part-time. I am busy 7 days a week between work, class, and homework/housework. Normally this is a very good thing for me as it keeps the depression and other mental illness at bay. But my grandma is dying. She was put into hospice over the weekend and cannot do much of anything anymore. I love her so much as my grandparents/mom is side of the family have been the only stable family I have ever had. My grandmother is an amazing woman. She graduated as valedictorian of her college class. She raised 7 amazing children (all college grads and successful in their fields) and has 14 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. She is 90 and has lived an amazing life. It is still so hard to say goodbye. I have been doing my best to spend time with her and my visiting family but the grief and depression are kicking my ass. I cannot do anything. I have a huge paper due this week and work has been insanely stressful. I cannot even manage to get my laundry done and I am buying and eating shit food that is bankrupting me. I do not know what to do. Life will not stop, and I am so stressed that my whole body is breaking out in rashes and I am sore all the time. I do not have any time off work since I have not been there long and we are already short staffed. The end of the semester is coming up and I cannot even think much less write a policy analysis. Any advice is welcomed.","My grandma is dying and life does not stop So I work full-time and go to grad school part-time.

"Hi, I am Ellen a.k.a. Froggie girl62, a 43-year-old female who has been depressed for life. I have been labeled as having dysthymia in the past. Although it was never officially shared with me, I believe from what I have read that I was depressed even as a child. I graduated college the first time in 1985 with a BA in Sociology with Medical Emphasis and have worked in the medical transcription field for 19 years. I have become bored with the job and dissatisfied with being forced to work from home. (Majorly boring!) Last year I started going back to school to pursue a Masters in Fine Arts in Graphic Design. This has been a huge challenge since I am brand new in the art field and most of the other students are already artists. In addition, I MUST work 40 hours a week to maintain my health insurance benefits. My mom has been my best friend and support person forever and now she has been diagnosed with lung cancer. She had surgery 2 months ago and just began chemotherapy last week. I have had an awful time dealing with this. Although she has been given a fairly decent prognosis, I am scared that she is going to leave me and would trade places with her in flash if I could. Truthfully I am disappointed every day when I wake up. I save lots of money on products to remove mascara, as the tears usually do the job. I had been on Zoloft 25 mg since the late 1990s and my family doctor increased it first to 50 and now to 100 mg. I have also started seeing a psychiatrist, only 2 sessions so far, so hard to say much about that. In the past when I went for counseling, they just gave me silly assignments and told me to go out and meet people. With my school work, I have enough assignments already. I found this forum from a post on another support forum.","I graduated college the first time in 1985 with a BA in Sociology with Medical Emphasis and have worked in the medical transcription field for 19 years.

"'I promised I would post regarding what I perceived to be a meltdown. As previously posted, I told all y'all that I would been taking Neurontin. Since it was not prescribed for seizures but for sleep, insurance would no longer cover it because they said it did not fit into the category of antidepressants or psychotropics, and so on and so forth. All red tape. So, the Neurontin was stopped, through no fault of my own. Well, this disturbed my therapist. So, after almost 6 weeks off of the Neurontin, during which each week I seemed to be going more off the deep end. Meaning, I could not sleep, eat, had the shakes, horrific mood swings, unable to think positive about myself, and piggyback panic attacks and I subsequently was going off on some crying gig, etc. So, on the 22nd when I saw my doctor she said with everything I was describing, that indeed I was having withdrawals. Like Duh, I already knew that. It seems the combination of the meds I was on was balancing me out and the mere change in the medicine did in fact change the way the other meds worked, or did not work. Since I am so hypersensitive to just about every medication, (it took forever to find the right medications and dosages to keep me on the straight and narrow) the doctor said she would like for me to go back to the psychiatrist that originally prescribed the medications and see if they would try another antidepressant. Another one? That did not set well with me and I guess I was at the end of my rope. I broke down and ended up staying at the doctor is office for almost two hours while they had to give me a pill to calm me down. I felt so vulnerable and of course in my state of mind I perceived this as another crisis. I also felt extremely istupid' for breaking down that way. That is why I said I had a ""meltdown."" There was not much I could physically do on Thursday, but, I knew I had to come back to earth. After calming down, thanks to their ""cocktail pill"", which I did not ask its name. I agreed to see the psychiatrist. What choice did I have. I think the crying episode happened because I remembered all the bad events that happened while they were trying to find the right meds that would balance me out. It is scary. Of course while I was at the doctor is, I kept asking stupid questions like, ""why do I have to be on anything?"" Is that denial or what? So, to cut this short. I will be going to the psychiatrist as soon as they can fit me in. But I need some help. I am asking any of my friends here to give me any input you want. I have been doing pretty good the last couple of days doing the cognitive thinking and just staying busy. It is the down time that is unsettling. And obviously, if you see the time this is being posted, you know I am not sleeping much. I am thinking positive. My doctor called me Friday to check on me. That was surprising. A doctor really calling back. So, seeing how she is my 'new' doctor, maybe we will be compatible after all. Thanks for taking the time to read this and for anything you would like to add to help. I really appreciate all of you and the joy I receive from reading and writing to you all means a lot to me. Your kindness means so much.","Meaning, I could not sleep, eat, had the shakes, horrific mood swings, unable to think positive about myself, and piggyback panic attacks and I subsequently was going off on some crying gig, etc.

"I am new to any kind of discussion like this. I am new to any kind of support like this. I go to Therapy once a week, or rather I did, but it was not really making a large difference. I am going to be twentytwo soon, and my life is nowhere how I wish it to be. The funny part is that to get it where I would like it all I would have to do is go out and get a job, start working. I just cannot seem to leave the house. I am not a shut in, or anything. I love people. I try and keep friends with everything, but I get self - conscious all the time. My early life was pretty difficult when it came to that, getting bullied badly for wearing glasses and being a bit of a dork. I never really learned those little social rules that everyone else did. Sometimes I just feel like I am not on everyone is page, and nothing seems to help. I became a father at nineteen, and it was difficult. I loved my girlfriend very much at the time, and dropped out of school to support her and our daughter. I love my daughter, she is everything. My girlfriend left me for another man when our daughter was four weeks old, I cannot help but feel insecure about this. Logically I should know she is just not so bright or genuine a person with me, but I cannot help but feel part of it was me. She stopped letting me see my daughter a short time after, I had to go to court and battle things out. The only accomplishment I have made in the last year that I could feel proud about was to get partial custody and three days a week with her. I am attentive and loving father. I have a great relationship with my little girl. But I cannot feel good about it. Sometimes it is like, as soon as she is gone, I forget she was even here. I spend all day in the house, like a zombie. I am either on the computer or at the TV, watching baseball. I know I want to have a healthy and happy life, and I want to have money and security for my daughter, but I cannot motivate myself to do anything. My parents were never attentive, and fight constantly, but I am twentyone and should be over that. Instead, it makes me more down now than it ever has. I am like a giant pit of negativity all the time. I was involved with a girl, but that faded quick, and just like everything else it brought me down. I do not do drugs, or drink, but sometimes I really want to. Funny part is that I have never felt any kind of relief doing them in the past. In fact, usually my insecurities and negativity are worse. I feel like I need to get moving soon, or I will never get moving. I tried killing myself after my girlfriend stopped letting me see my daughter, I know how bad that was for me. I know how I made others feel, and I know how miserable I was. I do not ever want to get that way again. But for some reason, and I just do not understand, I cannot get myself to get moving.","I am new to any kind of support like this.

My parents only having expectations for me to succeed just makes me feel like the biggest failure of my brothers. Which not only is bullshit but also makes me just not try in the first place a lot of the time. Because if I try and fail its worse because I am expected to succeed. I do not even understand why they expect me to be the successful one. I barely got acceptable grades in high school until senior year when I just took easy courses. I failed English and nearly failed Spanish in 9th grade because I was too lazy to put in any effort. I barely ever brought home friends or did extracurricular activities most of high school. But for some reason I am their grand vision for who is gonna make the family proud.,Because if I try and fail its worse because I am expected to succeed.
"new to the forum and just like to share my depression with you all. I was verbally abused at school from the age of 9 right the way up until i left school, at the age of 10 i self - harmed because i felt worthless not wanted and thick. at the age of 13 my dad left, at the age of 15 i took cannabis to get me through school, people at school used to pick on me everyday ""for nothing"" i would come home with tears dripping from my face go to my bedroom and cut myself with bits of glass. then at 16 the last year in school i used to get drunk before i went into school this helped me for a while it was the only thing i could rely on. anyway i am now 19 years old and have a list of problems such as: Social phobia / Mild Agoraphobia, Anxiety problems, Depression, Paranoia, Delusions and Insomnia ""what a list eh!!"" I do not want to play this sick board game we call life, i do not want anything from life it has nothing to offer me. i have lost count of all the times i have wanted to kill myself. I do not trust anyone i have no friends and i just want to be in total solitude. Why cannot people accept the fact i do not want to socialize? Why is that so wrong?

Ending my life if I turn 18 Things around me had become less interesting. I have become so bored to the point I just do not wanna live anymore.

"Read this if you want, I just needed to let this out somewhere instead of being bottled up inside me..

Even in objectively good circumstances I feel this emptiness Do you also feel this empty hole inside you while doing objectively interesting things like being on a holiday or doing something with your friends.

"I tried to get onto the chat room, but it will not let me so I will just post my question here. In my sociology class today my professor was talking about an experiment where several pseudomanic (healthy) patients checked into mental hospitals to record the results. The details of the experiment are not important, but what I was wondering was about how my teacher said that the patients used fake names so that it would not be on their permanent record and so that they would not be labeled as ""crazy"". So I raised my hand and asked who would be labeling them and why they could not use their real names, like how would people know? He said that it would be on their record and that if people wanted to find out if they have ever been hospitalized they could, particularly employers. Kind of like if you wanted to inquire about a rapist living in your town, is what he said. I wanted to ask more but did not want to press it. So my questions are, what kind of record does this go on? Your hospital record? Your police record? When employers do a background check, does this show up? Then I was wondering, when police pull you over for speeding or something and they check your information on their computer, what comes up? Everything? If they were involved in an ambulance taking someone into the hospital, do they have that on file? Is there any way to see what is on your file? I am just a little paranoid now about if there are going to be limitations in life now as to what I can do because of my record. Or if anyone knows how I would be able to find out this information that would be great,","In my sociology class today my professor was talking about an experiment where several pseudomanic (healthy) patients checked into mental hospitals to record the results.

fuck. so my ex who I miss like a lot and who moved away because she hated me so much is apparently coming back next year and.. I just want to die.

"I have severe anxiety and suicidal ideation I have no motivation to do anything. If i dont go to work im in bed all day. I have no desire to text friends or do things i used to be passionate about. All i can think about is how much of a loser i am because i have not applied to any colleges yet (i graduated in may). I see on social media people going out and having fun and i look at myself, im never out of bed. The only time i shower is when i go to work or go run errands with my mom. I am physically and mentally exhausted. Another thing, I have severe anxiety about posting on social media. Ill muster the courage to post a selfie and then delete an hour later. When i have panic attacks i delete my profile picture, bio and everything i posted that is a picture of me or i think people will judge me for. I keep thinking that my friends are just talking about me behind my back and actually hate me. These thoughts get so overwhelming that i start picking at my skin where i think there is something ""wrong"" about it and pulling my hair out. I keep cutting my hair, too. Its only two inches and it used to be down to my elbow. I keep thinking it will be all over if i just walk outside onto the freeway or swallow some pills. The only thing stopping me is that i cannot get out of bed most days. I cant handle being myself anymore and i dont know what to do","If i dont go to work im in bed all day.

"How do I know I am depressed? I do not have persistent sadness but some days I just feel really really down. Today I thought about how I could kill myself on my commute, but I think those might have just been wandering thoughts and nothing serious. I think today I might just have a case of the Mondays?",-
"I will never be able to take care of myself, let alone anyone else. I physically cannot find the energy to even do the most basic things, like laundry, showering, and eating. Grocery shopping is a really tiring adventure that is followed by a four hour nap. My schoolwork to rest ratio is 1:10. I cannot even remember to water the singular plant that I own. They always end up dying before I even realize. I do not even know how I would be able to take care of a pet, let alone any kids. It is a really good thing I do not want kids, because I would be a terrible, neglectful mother. I would hardly have any energy to make them food, let alone entertain them. I do not understand how people can clean and do laundry and brush their teeth every day. They are mountains to me.","I will never be able to take care of myself, let alone anyone else.

"Really struggling with self image - any tips to build self confidence? I have struggled with my overall view of myself for as long as I can remember - in particular with my weight. Where im at, at the moment feels like the worst its ever been, I keep having full blown melt downs about how much I repulse myself. Throughout my life Ive been on more diets than I can count and tried multiple different excercise routines. About 4 years ago I gained 30kgs really fast and after moping and feeling sorry for myself i decided i would kick it up a notch and started taking things really serious. 6 days a week at the gym, personal training, strict meal plans - the works. This worked so well at the beginning, I dropped 18kgs in the first few months. It came to a halt and for the past 3 years I have continued to lose weight slower - im at about 25 kilos down in total now. I thought I would be further along by now. I live and work on the road at the moment travelling from town to town so ive dropped the gym membership but I try and make up for it with doing workout sessions on my own, lots of hiking and swimming. I recently switched to a keto diet from the previous meal plan I was on. I am fitter than I have ever been and what I can achieve now in a physical capacity is so much greater than ever before in my life (I was less fit even as a child) The problem I have is that im still so overweight, I very rarely find anything that fits me in stores and i dont have an address to order things online. I feel like people could look at me and assume I dont give a fuck about my health when I do and that makes me feel worse. Anytime I talk to doctors about unrelated issues they make it about my weight. I feel like outwardly im the worst version of myself, I look in the mirror and get angry. Does anyone have any tips on how to pull myself out of this? I feel so crushed when I am reminded of my weight because I dont feel how I look. I want to be proud of my achievements but I am not, I feel annoyed that its not better and I havent reached a bigger goal. I think ill never reach a weight I am happy with - which is not only devastating to me but bothers me so much more because im genuinely trying my hardest. Ive had hiccups and times where I have literally tried to eat my feelings away but I always pick myself up and try again. I dont know how many more times I can fail. In an effort to help me stay on track my partner started eating the same foods as me. Weightloss had never been his goal or something he was focusing on, it was just to make it easier on me not to see him eating a toasted cheese sandwich while I was eating salad with no dressing. He wanted to limit the temptation and helped cook me awesome healthy meals that tasted a million times better than anything I cooked. For him it worked a treat, he was never overweight just a bit stocky, but hes since lost so much weight and looks amazing. And whilst im so happy for him it hurts as it just shows how much progress i havent made. As stupid as it sounds I think it highlights my weight more when we are together cause he looks so fit and healthy and I look like I sit around eating kfc all day. I want to be confident or at least more confident but I am so critical on myself I cant even begin to let the confidence through. Any thoughts on this are appreciated and thankyou to anyone who took the time to read this.","I feel like people could look at me and assume I dont give a fuck about my health when I do and that makes me feel worse.

"This girl I do not really know walked up to me and drew a heart on my paper I know it is something so small and meaningless but it made me really feel better. My day was really hard and some portions I felt as if I was going to start crying. I despise myself and the fact that someone can walk up to me and draw something kind of sweet and cute on my paper makes me feel less gross and insecure. Sadly my awkward self did not respond very fast and by the time my brain was able to form a ""aww thank you"" she walked away. Thanks Trinity, that was really nice, it really did make me feel better.",This girl I do not really know walked up to me and drew a heart on my paper I know it is something so small and meaningless but it made me really feel better.
"I do not know what my problem is Hello, I have never posted here before. I am a 28 year old guy and have a decent job that I like, it is quiet and involves a lot of puzzle solving and I am pretty good at it. I have never had a ton of friends because I am very particular and not very open with people so it takes a long time to build up relationships, but the friends I do have are outstanding and I would not trade them for anything. I am kind of the funny guy but my humor is very blue. I got bullied a lot in grade school and learned to make people laugh because it would get them to not make fun of me. I think it just kind of stuck. I do not know if any of that information is really important, just wanted to give it in case that is something that people do here. For at least 5 years, I have a hard time doing anything outside of my job alone without crawling up inside my head. All the things that I used to do for enjoyment like listening to music or playing video games, I just cannot do anything anymore. It is like a wave of apathy that very rarely lifts. Occasionally, I pick up a razor blade and will press it into my shoulder or hand and I do not really know why to be honest. I do not know if I like the pain or maybe I like having something else to focus on for a minute. Or just to feel something that is not apathy for a moment. I think about dying sometimes. Why we are here, what is the point if it ends the same. I doubt I would ever kill myself because there are things I care about here that I would not leave behind like that, mainly my mom and brother. I worry my brother will end up like me. Is there anything I can do? I do not know what a pill could do for me or if a pill works. I think the brain is so complex that it could not, but I guess I do not know. I do not want to be in a mental fog or be unaware or not be me anymore. I have also always kind of thought that it is human nature to feel this way: that everybody gets down, gets bored, thinks about their mortality, etc. and that I am just being soft and need to suck it up. Life is difficult, I just need to learn to deal with it maybe. I do not know what is going on but I do not like feeling like that. If I am hanging out with friends or family I am usually fine, it is being alone with myself and having time alone where I cannot entertain myself and waste away. I cannot really explain it. Does anyone else feel like this? What helps you? I have never talked to a therapist or anything like that and understand you cannot give a diagnosis on here, but if you know any methods to help me get out of that feeling, I would be eternally grateful. Is this what depression feels like and I have just been in denial about having it for years?","I do not know if I like the pain or maybe I like having something else to focus on for a minute.

Why does depression do this It is destroyed my ability to properly feel love or empathy with those closest to me. It is driving me insane and making me feel like I do not care about them anymore. But before depression I would have laughed if you would told me I did not care about my family. I have always been full of love and empathy. Now I am just angry and snappy with them. I feel like a monster.,Why does depression do this It is destroyed my ability to properly feel love or empathy with those closest to me.
"I want to die [trigger warning] [Trigger Warning] My trauma happened when i was 8, I am now 18 and still suffer from it daily. I actually suppressed the trauma completely until I was 12, when it all came back to me; so I guess I have only really been dealing with it for 6 years now. I have severe PTSD, severe depression, anxiety, severe panic/anxiety attacks, OCD, severe memory loss, and had an intense eating disorder for 6 years that I am still struggling with constantly. I have not gotten a good nights' sleep in years. I have constant PTSD nightmares, regular nightmares, and insomnia/constant fatigue and exhaustion. I also disassociate a lot and self harmed for years. Currently clean from self harm for about a year and a half. I have been admitted to a hospital because of all of my mental problems, and honestly wish I could go back sometimes. I was gaslighted for years to believe that my trauma was normal. My home environment was constantly hostile. I go through long periods of feeling suicidal. Currently in that period. Do not know what to do, honestly. Years of being in therapy and being prescribed pills and yet I still am nowhere near being close to healthy. Looking back, I cannot even remember the last time I was genuinely happy. The periods of my sadness last longer than my periods of calm. I am so afraid of waking up when I am 40 and still feeling the same way I do now. The thing about being an adult that spent their entire teenage years thinking they would have killed themselves by now is realizing that your mental illnesses have real repercussions. I have fucked bones and a fucked stomach because of an eating disorder that lasted so long and a GED because I couldnt find the will to do schoolwork when I was just trying to find the will to live another day and not cut myself again. I cannot afford college because I did not do any extracurriculars to get scholarships because the thought of having to stay after school made me want to have a panic attack and i just wanted to sleep. I have no friends because when people invited me to hang out my anxiety made me cry myself to sleep instead. I did not have any real thought-out grand plans because I was too busy hurting myself and getting high and wanting to kill myself to really sit down and plan things out. I said I wanted to do things but never took the time to think it all through. It doesnt seem fair that I went through this trauma, had/have all of this mental illness, and now have to do with the repercussions of those illnesses. It doesnt seem fair that I am suffering so much still. I do not know what to do anymore. I am tired of trying so fucking hard. I know this is self-pitying and 'emo' but I just do not know what to do. I have no one to talk to. I really just want to die.","I have severe PTSD, severe depression, anxiety, severe panic/anxiety attacks, OCD, severe memory loss, and had an intense eating disorder for 6 years that I am still struggling with constantly.

"Escapism and depression Sorry about the self-pity rant that is inbound, needed to get this out there somehow. This morning I was taking a shower sitting down with the lights off - I know, pretty edgy behavior, but it is my way of unwinding and resetting myself between bouts of work. I finished up a relatively escapist story the night prior. Stupidly, I had allowed myself to suspend my disbelief and got sucked into the plot. The writing was not even terribly good - the only reason I enjoyed myself was because I could temporarily forget my current self and take up the role of some other more relevant and admirable character. The story ended with a shoehorned but unbearably happy ending where the main character gets married, settles in with his newfound friends, and all is good for the time being. You know, the typical ""insert generic ending here"" bullshit. Fast forward to this morning. I am in the shower and start thinking of my day to come, making mental to-do lists, and stressing about my current temporary problems. But somewhere along the line, I start thinking of the stupid story. I cannot help but start comparing my life with that of the main character and think about how much I would give just to be able to live a more meaningful, less real life. Then I start comparing myself to the character, and realize just how _useless_ I am. Like holy shit, I am almost an adult and am still a passionless idiot who does nothing outside of schoolwork. Of course I cannot lead a meaningful life, I am not worthy of any of it. Thinking about this evidently stressed me out a bit too much, as I started puking what little I ate all over my shower floor and crying. I do not know. I enjoy escapism probably to a fault, but it is the only way for me to feel at least a little relevant. I will probably come to terms with my role as human being 6,732,385,402 someday. Many thanks to anybody who bothered to read this wall of text.","I am in the shower and start thinking of my day to come, making mental to-do lists, and stressing about my current temporary problems.

"It is been so long since I have been here doubt anyone would remember me! Lots has been happening. My job has become busier so I have become more exhausted when I get home and I just do not want to do anything. Then on March 4 my brother from my adopted mother died of a heart attack so had to go through that experience with my niece, his only daughter. Then right after that my husband got really sick with pain in his belly. We took him into emergency and they did a CT scan and could see only massive infection and could not tell where it was coming from. So he was admitted and given antibiotics and scheduled for a colonoscopy. He was also very low on potassium so he was given bags of potassium and taking pills on top of that. His colon was clear so it was determined his gall bladder was diseased and needed to come out. But right now it was so swollen and infected the surgeon wanted to wait until the infection cleared and swelling went down before he took it out. So husband is now on a non-fat diet to reduce the swelling and still on antibiotics to clear out the infection. Fortunately, being vegan, non - fat is not too hard for us to do. He goes in for a pre - exam on Wednesday and then surgery a week later. But through all this I have not been doing my routing of medications and exercise and am suffering for it. Fibro and migraines have hit me really hard. I am still trying to take care of my husband though by preparing his meals. He lost almost 30 lbs through the last week of this whole episode. In the meantime, I have an appointment Monday with a neurosurgeon to discuss if something needs to be done with my tethered spinal cord. I have had it for years and it causes weakness in my legs and pins and needles in my feet. It could also affect bladder and bowel functions but I have not had that problem yet. I have read that sometimes they cut the end of the spinal cord to get it out of the way of the vertebrae. I am not sure how serious my case is but my neurologist thought it was serious enough to send me to surgeons. It is a rare birth defect I guess found in adults. Usually they catch it in infants. So, in a LARGE nutshell, that has been what I have been up to","We took him into emergency and they did a CT scan and could see only massive infection and could not tell where it was coming from.

"Today I realized I do not have any friends. Not really. This weekend I was going to go to a Harry Potter symphony with my two aunts. One of them and my grandma, who all live together, got sick. They gave me the three tickets. They told me to go with friends, but they do not want to chance getting me sick or no one staying with their mom. Fair enough. As I was driving home from work today I was thinking about who to take, and I came up blank. No one came to mind. I have my roommates, but I do not really talk to them much and they all have girlfriends that they hang out with all the time anyway. Even the ones I went to high school with. I realized the other day when they mentioned it in passing that they had started a new DnD campaign with a new guy. I am never invited to dinners or anything anymore. We never make a big ass meal together on Saturday anymore. Honestly, I do not think they would even want to go anyway. There is no one else I would ask. Everyone at work is either dating someone or I do not know them well enough. I am taking online classes so no one there either. I do not do anything outside of school or work. I do not even have any friends to take to this fucking symphony. Not even one. I identify more with the characters in the books I read than with anyone I know. I do not know what to do. I feel so alone. I am not even that close with my family, not really. Not well enough that I can even really talk about my opinions and especially not my emotions.

"I have been depressed all my life and I am just tired I am finding it harder and harder everyday. I am almost 23 years old and I cannot even function properly. I feel like I have the mental capacity of a child sometimes because I do not know how to do anything. My entire life I lived in fear of my parents and now that I am out I just cannot function at all. I had to quit my job because I could not handle being at work in my emotional state. I cannot handle people being vaguely negative towards me. I feel awful because now it is just my fianc working, but he says that it is okay that I need time.. I cannot help but feel he resents me for it. I do not even know how we are going to pay for our wedding. I do not know anything about feminine hygiene, or how to brush/style my hair. It is just matted in knots and up in a bun, or if it looks decent enough I will put it in a ponytail. I do not know how to keep friends because I was constantly grounded for everything. I spent most of my life alone in my room, when I was grounded I was not allowed to eat dinner with the family. I have 2 step sisters, one half sister, and 3 half brothers. All from 3 different marriages not including my parents' since I am their only child. And I am not close with any of them. I do not even know all of their ages. I did not have mother figure in my life because my stepmoms were just either physically abusive or emotionally. My dad was a drunk, and just controlled every aspect of my life yelling at me if I did not want to do something or had different opinions than him you think you are in control of your life but you are not. You belong to me or make weird sexual remarks in front of his friend when I would have a friend over oh you two girls are probably going to kiss and rollover on top of each other thankfully not in front of her. But sadly our friendship did not really last very long. Then he convinced me to get really drunk when I went to go visit from college and his friend tried taking advantage of me when I was trying to sleep it off in my room. I want to get a better job than the one I had previously but my upkeep is awful and I probably would not get hired.. And I know I have to better myself but it is just so hard I just do not know where to start. I have no money. No friends. I practically have no family because I never want to go back. I dropped out of school because I could not afford it anymore because my dad stole the money I saved up. But even if he did not I probably still would have dropped out because I could not pick a major, I kept changing it, and I feel like a loser because I was supposed to graduate this year. I used to be really good at math and writing and now I cannot even remember simple math or how to use proper grammar. I find myself not knowing how to spell words or using the wrong ones and it just makes me feel so stupid. I hate it. I was diagnosed with BPD and I cannot even afford to treat it. My car stopped working, and I do not even know how to use a bus. I hate my life. I hate everything. I am just so tired of it all. I already went to a mental facility for a month and I still cannot function. I cannot bring myself to end it all because I love my fianc more than anything. He is been my one true friend since high school, even if we only spoke at school, he is always been there for me. I cannot leave him. I do not know what to do. I do not have clear thinking. I hate that I am so black and white, I am just trying to be gray.

"The last 3 days felt like the first days of my life. Today feels like the beginning of the last days. I have been having depression since Senior Year. I have been fighting non stop for 5 years. I took gap years to fight depression. Until last October, I thought depression has gone cause i felt totally normal at that time. During the time, I had a lot of ups and downs. Lots of tears, lots of laugh. But i have never given up on myself Last November, my brother did sth bad. And my ex attempted suicide. That is when i got depressed again. The first time in 2 years Until 3 days ago, I met a girl. ""Perfect stranger"" is the word that would suit her the most.

And 3 days after we met ( we hung out everyday for the last 3 days), she is gone. We still keep contact but I dont think i would ever see her again ( please dont ask why). She knows about depression. She made me make a promise to reach out to her every time i get depressed. The last 3 days were the happiest days of my life. It feels like I actually live for the first time. But i also got depressed since. I got depressed because i could not recall her image. I couldnt recall her face. I could not recall what she looked like when we first met. And i couldnt remember why those were the happiest days of my life. I just recall those were the happiest. All i can recall is a brief moment of her smile for like 5-10 secs, her voice, and the moment when we were about to say good bye that i poured out my heart. Everything is so blurry. Then i went on to google to search for blurry memories and depression. And it leads me to ""depression and memory loss"" and "" depression and Alzheimer "" . Then i started to shed tears. I was thinking about the day i actually lost my memories. What if it actually comes, What if one day i wouldnt remember her, my mom, my best friends, and even myself ? I was teaching in class when i shed tears. I had to run to the bathroom and cried in there for 15 mins. Luckily noone noticed. I remembered my promise to her. I was about to text her. And then i started to cry again. I will bother her. I will make her worried. I will waste her time. And i cant afford to hurt people i love. This is the beginning of the end.

"Am I Depressed or is it something else? This seems like a dumb question because to an extent I know I am depressed but not to a clinical level. Like I hate the situation I am in. I hate being in debt. I hate living where I live. That sort of thing. However, I am not unmotivated. Like at all. I am not hopeless. I am not suicidal in any way. I am terrified of death in fact one of my biggest fears is that I will get so depressed that I will become suicidal which is weird, I know but the point is, nothing in me wants to die. That being said, I am tired all the time. I mean physically exhausted. Which seems to contradict major depression. I get up every day, shower every day, though I do not really want to go to work I go to work and do work with no issue (it is more that I do not enjoy my job that much on most days honestly some days it is super fun it is just one of those things it really has to do with the fact that I am older and I am not doing what I thought I would be doing by this point in my life more than I hate my job). I cannot think of many reasons why I would be this physically exhausted all the time. Literally every doctor says ""You you are just massively depressed"". No, I do not believe I am depressed to the degree that it makes me physically exhausted. If I still have plenty of hope for the future, want to get up, want to get dressed, want to shower, want to look good..how is this major depression to a point where I am also tired all the time? Is it possible to have some major depressive disorder and not be hopeless and still be motivated to work hard and try new things? Because if it is, someone needs to tell me that. Any time a doctor tells me I must be depressed if I am so tired all the time and I tell them that I am not hopeless or suicidal or unmotivated then they go, ""Oh well I do not know what it is then"". I am very annoyed with this because I never used to be physically exhausted like this before and doctors seem to just dismiss it as depression when I am positive my depression is not so bad it is ONLY making my physically exhausted and not having any other emotional affect on me. I am frustrated so, if anyone can answer this it would be helpful so I can see what avenue to pursue next.

"Back pain has brought me to a dark space. I have been struggling with back pain for 2 years now and I am 17. I play soccer (football), and thats all I know, I have played my whole life. I do not have much friends nor other hobbies besides gaming (very mediocre gamer). However, these pass two years have been terrible. Due to my undying love for the sport, I would try to play through the pain. (regret it) Which has only made me worse. I decided my first Summer with back pain that I would not play for a month. Which I achieved with no real results. I passed the time playing Video games. However, the constant sitting probably made my back worse. I played a tournament that same Summer after the month break. 5 games some sort of international tournament. By the end of the tournament my back had gotten so bad I could not bear to move. Despite all this, I somehow got chosen to go to Spain. Few months later I went to Spain at 16, with back pain, played soccer and such but did not get noticed. Fast forward to now and I have gone a whole season barley playing and still struggle with back pain. Now I am 17, I have gone this whole Summer without much activity just stretching and ab work outs. The Summer is almost over and the realization that I have not gotten better is bringing a dark cloud over me. I scream at night out of anger and sadness. I constantly tell myself I want to die(&lt;-Im not sure if this is breaking a rule, sorry in advanced, just tell me and I will remove this part), and I cry everyday. I do most of those things in private, when no one is home (excluding the random screaming I do at night). I do not want my mom to worry about me like she does my diagnosed depressed big brother, and also her dealing with my little brother is life (He is 7). On top of all that my mom is a single mom and barley has time for her own life and gets sad easily. (The sight of my mom sad deeply pains me inside) I have always been the one kid that could take care of himself. She has even told me personally that she is glad that she does not need to worry too much about me (only deals with my back pain, she takes me to rehab). I have been to the Doctors and have done a MRI, they say its nothing. Just functional. (Whatever that means..) Point is, I am very sad and I feel like I am getting worse everyday. I do not know what to do with my life. The one thing I was good at is now gone. I do not have any other talents or interest.I feel empty without soccer and I do not know how to feel it. TL; DR: I have played soccer my whole life, got a back injury two years ago and I still have not healed. Doctors say its nothing) As a result, I am very sad but I keep it to myself. I am not good at anything else.","I play soccer (football), and thats all I know, I have played my whole life.

"ok, so today i had another freak out. I woke up feeling good .. it was supposed to be my first therapy session (which i and my boyfriend were happy about) and then after this i was supposed to meet up with my boyfriend for lunch, check my test marks, and then go to the library with my boyfriend to study. These plans changed.. When i walked into the therapy office, they said no appointment was scheduled. All of a sudden i felt really rejected, not worthy of an appointment (like they gave it to someone else), anxious, sick to my stomach, a little dizzy. I have been waiting since February for this appointment! I could not deal with my anger properly or the fact that my plans for therapy were ruined today. I started stuttering kind of i kind of got all dazed out and really sick when the receptionist wanted to schedule another appointment. So, it is tomorrow at 9am .. 9am!! What bastards. Anyway, so because i got all weird .. i did not want to be around people. I called my boyfriend .. could not get a hold of him. I cancelled .. did not check my marks, did not go to the library, or lunch or see my boyfriend. I left. I told my boyfriend i had bad anxiety. So, now he wants a ""break."" And I have been in my room since i got home (since about 1pm) .. feeling really low and weird and lightheaded .. I have been rocking a lot too on my rocking chair .. it is a weird compulsive soothing mechanism i have. Do not ask. I am mad at my boyfriend because he decided to take a break when i needed him most. Is this cold or what?! At the same time i understand: he wants his ""brain clear"" for exam studying. Whatever. I guess it is hard being with a depressed, neurotic girl. No one wants to be with a depressed girl. Let is not kid ourselves here.","it was supposed to be my first therapy session (which i and my boyfriend were happy about) and then after this i was supposed to meet up with my boyfriend for lunch, check my test marks, and then go to the library with my boyfriend to study.

"This is how I feel and I have a slight sense I am the only one to think think this way. I am depressed? Help wanted I yearn for the days I was in high school. I felt as if I was always happy and never worried about anything. I am 22, just having graduated from University. It seems each day I am becoming a person who does not want to have a relationship with anyone other then my family. I want to be alone. Happiness to me is being sheltered by reality--alone with my thoughts. I deleted every single bit of social media I had about a year ago (SC, FB, Insta, Twitter, etc) in an attempt to become as alone as possible. I truly deep down wish I was never born, but I would never ever commit suicide. I wish more then anything else that I can just disappear and leave this world. I am studying for the MCAT currently. I do not have any problem doing so because of my extremely addictive personality, but I find that I enjoy things that take my mind off of reality. Studying, reading, listening to music or going for a drives are my favorite ways to achieve this. But the reality I see is that this world is shit. I believe that as a whole, humans are riddled with greed and selfishness that are the motivations behind MOST of everything in this world. And by humans, that obviously includes myself and I hate myself down to the core for the selfish things I have done. Maybe I am too cynical or something. But this bad world syndrome fucks my brain and idk. I REEALLY question every aspect of life and I cannot help it. Each time I am left with questions that completely make me hate the way this world is. I guess I can give one example. The most recent self-philosophical argument I had is the idea of wars, with murdering others specifically. We praise those who fight for our country, yet at the same time a great deal of these same people are super religious. Do people not evaluate the reality they are in? Do they not question why they believe the things they do? Am I the only one? Does someone is act of ending another life provide justification for doing the same? Who is to even say so? If they would kill all of us if we did not kill them, then what makes our lives worth more? That is just one example, but then I look at areas like American healthcare or the fact my family and others are wealthy while there are people fucking dying because they cannot get water or food. Even the American political system with the deep state and shit. Why are we even on this damn earth? Seriously, what is the point of everything in life? I simply do not view the joys of life being worth living for. I just do not understand. This whole text here is just me rambling my thoughts in hopes that someone somewhere reading this could maybe help me.","Happiness to me is being sheltered by reality--alone with my thoughts.

"I know you should not need someone else to complete you but.. I feel so alone and empty and the few times I have ever felt truly happy is when I am with a guy, whether he is using me or not. Idk it is led to me getting my heartbroken a bunch, I let so many guys use me too but I guess in a weird way I was also using them? I was never really in love with any of them except for 1 and was mostly in it because I loved the idea of a relationship. I do not like being alone and I fear I will never find someone I truly love and who loves me, leading to me living my life full of sadness and regret","I do not like being alone and I fear I will never find someone I truly love and who loves me, leading to me living my life full of sadness and regret"
"As you live life and learn new things you grow more mature. Life is not about growing up and making plans for tomorrow, it is about enjoying every moment as you are living. Happiness is the most important thing and people have forgotten that. The world is full of so many interesting things that all cost money and we believe having a lot of something is the key to happiness. And since money is the thing that buys us the things we want we sort of become obsessed with getting as much of it as we can. In my mom and my situation we have tasted what money can buy us and we do not want to go back to the way things used to be. But the thing is we were both happy then and now we are not. I have learned money cannot buy happiness. My dad and Julie do not have much money and they are happy. There is something we can all say we regret from our lives. I regret regretting. Everyday I have lived has come to this moment and even after all the things that have gone wrong recently, I can pretty much say I am happy with they way my life has turned out. I am happy with who I am behind my mask. I am happy with what I know and what I want to know. Lately I have been wanting to die. Actually no, I wanted to want to die. Depression is all about seeing those bad moments and ignoring the good times in your life. When you are depressed the only thing that matters are the bad times. I do not think I was stupid for wanting to want to die. When something goes wrong you tend to act out of spite as soon as it happens because you are so overwhelmed with the moment. Most people do this - it does not mean we are stupid it just means we got carried away and we sometimes do things without thinking. Now I am starting to realize that the break up with Scott was a good thing. We were forcing something that was not making either of us happy. Of course I did not think about either him or me and our happiness I just wanted to keep us together for as long as possible. Besides I have too many other things going on in my life right now that I need to work on and if we were still together I would have ignored these things. I do not want to become one of those people who throw their entire lives in their online journal so I will not go into everything that is going on with me. If you are my friend you know. I am through acting like someone else in order to please people. This is my life and I am the one living it. Other people will not be around my whole life but I will so therefore I am putting myself and my happiness first. No more staying in one place because I am afraid of change. I want to experience as much as I can because to me that is what life is all about. No more dwelling on the past it cannot be changed - move onto today that is were things are happening and decisions need to be made. I do not want to slip off the road by looking the wrong way like I did on my driving test which by the way I failed. But that is ok, there is always next Thursday. OK enough with the things I have already learned and experienced. Onto new things, new places, and new people. I am tired of feeling sorry for myself and wanting to be someone else. I am going to be me again and do what makes me happy. I am going to take advantage of the help I am getting and I am going to help myself get better and not depend on others to save me. And I am also sorry to Scott, one of the reasons why I was so dependent on you was because you helped me and I thought you could save me entirely and make all the bad things go away. I now realize I am the only one who can do that. I am sorry I turned you into my therapist. I am through with the break inside my hole, time to climb out.","As you live life and learn new things you grow more mature.

"Now, I know we are all on the same bus, but I am an engineer who works with nerds all day. These people are social misfits (not like I am not!!) but I can sit in my hamster cage all day and one will talk to me. They really do not talk to each other unless it is either work - related or they are talking about themselves. It is like working with robots, and they are good at it!

"I feel like I am dead already. Nothing gives me joy anymore, but I am perfectly able to feel every negative emotion that is there. I feel like I am wasting everyone is time. Basically it does not matter whether I am around or not because I do not get anything out of it. I cannot enjoy shit anymore. I do not wanna exist anymore. I feel like dying would be the best solution for everyone. but last night, for the first time, I felt like I could end it myself. it was enough, my emotions pushed me to the thought of actually doing it. I am not afraid, I am kind of glad that maybe there will be an end to all of this, maybe I can overcome my extreme guilt and end it myself one day.","I feel like I am dead already.

"I am 23 years old. After a long time of finally trying to get my life on track, I finally had it all together. I found the person I was meant to be with for the rest of my life and everything was so wonderful. I have never been so happy. I had known this guy for two and a half years and we always liked each other. Obstacles kept coming up that prevented us from being together; one being that I live in Kentucky and he lives in Texas. After I broke up with my ex in December, we finally got together. He was going to move here in June and it was going to be perfect. Then a few days ago he got into a horrible car crash and lost his memory. He still remembers me but he remembers me as a friend. He does not remember me the way we were .. in love. Now whenever I talk to him .. he will not tell me that he loves me back and he acts like I make him uncomfortable. When I tell him about the way things used to be, he does not seem to care. I do not he cannot remember but it is so devastating for me. I am terrified that he will not remember how much he loved me and that he will find someone else down there. I am finding it extremely hard to cope and almost feel like I cannot function. I do not know what to say/do anymore. Any advice / thoughts would be so appreciated!","After a long time of finally trying to get my life on track, I finally had it all together.

"I am quitting my job. I have been working at a department store for about 5 months yet, and I just cannot do it anymore. There is too much to know and I just cannot keep up. People who have been there 3 weeks are telling me how to do things. I sat down with my manager this morning and explained it all. The crying in the bathroom, the calling in sick because I am too scared to go in, everything. She was really nice about it, and I decided to put in my notice. It feels like a failure, but I gave it my best try, and it is not working out. I feel relieved that I only have 2 more weeks. I do not have another job lined up yet but I had to get out. I know that is not a good choice, but the anxiety is so intense there. I feel like a bit of a failure. A blind labradoodle could do this job haha.

"Just wondering, for those who have had lifelong depression did you ever find some joy that was not turned to a sad story? I am starting to feel that depression never goes away, you just learn to manage it. I however, cannot recall a time in my life where I was happy. I do not even congratulate myself when I do accomplish something. I do not allow others to either, because it does not mean much to get praised for things I should have accomplished a long time ago. Anyways, I am on meds and truth is, I do not feel like myself? I do not think any drug can make me feel myself? Depression in some wicked way has made me become the person I am today. A lot of my coping skills and defense mechanisms are still present and that makes a lot of who I am.","I am starting to feel that depression never goes away, you just learn to manage it."
"I have been recently released from the hospital after a failed suicide attempt. I am trying to learn how to cope with things and I recently found out that my wife has disclosed the fact that I attempted suicide to many people (about 8) that I really do not know, nor do I feel comfortable with them knowing. As a matter of fact, I am very upset about this. For a little background my wife and i have not had the best relationship for the past 2 - 3 years. about 18 months ago we moved back to her hometown after I lost my job and she could advance in her career where we are now. I really do not have any friends down here and have lost contact with my old friends. I have told 3 people that I attempted suicide (mom, dad, brother) and i knew that her family knew (mom, dad, 2 sisters) Now my wife tells me that she needed to deal with what I have done and she has told many of her coworkers. She could not talk about this with her family or with her high school friends (which are still in the area, and I have known about 8 years). She had to tell people that she knows I do not know very well, and of what I do know, I do not like very much. Now my wife wants me to do more things with her coworkers and I feel very uncomfortable around them. Am I being too sensitive about this? Not realizing my wife is needs? Or am I justified in my being upset? I will not be able to come back to this board until Monday (tomorrow) evening so I cannot post any replies until then.","I am trying to learn how to cope with things and I recently found out that my wife has disclosed the fact that I attempted suicide to many people (about 8) that I really do not know, nor do I feel comfortable with them knowing.

"Is it stress, depression or burn out? Hey, I am a diabetic 1 with Autism. For the past 3 years i have felt constant fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems, bad memory and concentration issues. I took antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg before this during 8 months for major stress and it helped me with almost no side effects. But after i quit antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg ,the fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems and concentration issues has been persistent in my life. Now for 3 years. No matter how much rest i get i feel tired. Even if excercise, eat healthy, do yoga and meditation. My blood sugar levels has been up and down lately. But even if they are controlled i feel the same. A cause could be that i have worked on a lot of projects during the past 3 years. It went as far as that i started to get suicide thoughts. I do not feel any ups or downs in my life. Things i used to like to do isles enjoyable. I rather stay at home than being social. I believe i have major depression and i have visited psychologist and psychiatrist who have advised me to take antidepressants. But the question is if I am stressed, have major depression or simply burnt out. I certainly feel that i have a huge major depression. My OCD thought are back and i have been stuck on testing my blood sugar 10-15 times per day during the past year. Which also could bring my stress levels up. The past year has been very stressful for me work wise. But even if i get a weekend of rest i do not feel rested. I have been to different psychiatrists and psychologist and the conclusion is either major depression or burn out. I barely have the energy to clean my apartment anymore, wash my clothes or think about my hygiene. I feel tearful occasionally on some days. I have thought about taking antidepressants again, particularly Cymbalta since it worked for me the first time. But i have been afraid of taking them. Instead my psychiatrist described me brintellix (Vortioxetine), 10 mg per day for my depression. But the question is, i am i stressed, depressed or burnt out? Anyone have been in a similar case? Any experiences of the antidepressants brintellix (Vortioxetine) for major depression? I am so afraid of starting to take them, but i do not want to feel this way of every morning waking up with no motivation for anything that the day brings me.","I believe i have major depression and i have visited psychologist and psychiatrist who have advised me to take antidepressants.

And then be surprised when no one is around. Cast down, cast down.

"Hello again everyone, my real name is Mike. I found this site a couple weeks ago but have been pretty busy with the holidays and a new job. So I thought I would post a bit more about myself. This is not easy since I am not that good at talking about myself but here goes. I am 35 years old and have been depressed as long as I can remember. When I was 12 or 13 years old I remember sitting in my closet in my room with the doors shut writing a suicide note. After talking to a friend of mine about 7 years ago who started going to a therapist and taking Prozac, I decided to go get help. I did not even know to call it depression until I started talking to him. I was diagnosed with Dysthymic Disorder and have been on and off a couple different kinds of medicines, one of which was Effexor and the other one I cannot remember the name but it started with and S. I have a bad habit of remembering every bad thing that has ever happened to me and continually go over and over it in my head. I will bring up something with my brother or sister and they say ""I cannot believe you remember that"" and yet sometimes I am lucky I remember my own name. I just started a new job recently and will not have insurance until the end of January. I am seriously considering going back to a therapist and possibly getting on medicines again. I am tired of carrying around this baggage and want to do something about it. There are so many things I want to do with my life and seem held back by my depression. I found this site one night after feeling really depressed over something that I cannot even remember now in the hope talking to people who knew how I felt and what I was going through.","I am 35 years old and have been depressed as long as I can remember.

"NOTES FOR A SUCCESSFUL EFFEXOR WITHDRAWAL After doing research on this board and others, I prepared the following withdrawal regime and carried it out, making slight adjustments as I went along. It worked for me, although the withdrawal was not easy. I share it with you all in gratitude for all your advice and sharing over these past months. I hope it will be a help for you preparing to come off Effexor 1. MY SITUATION: a. Length of Time of Effexor: 5.5 years b. Dosage: 150 mg XR c. Reason for Effexor: TMJ, myofascia and migraines due to a displaced jaw disc, lock jaw and stress. d. Other medications: Flexeril (periodically over the years but not in past year when things are ""bad""); Trazodone, for sleep; vitamins and herbs as needed. e. Status: Age: 43, Height 5'-10""; Weight: 160. Married, no kids, work from home. f. Reasons to Come Off: Generally feeling better with the help of physiotherapist; life situation has become low-stress and stabile (secure job, good marriage, work from home); side effects of Effexor becoming irritating, especially the emotional distance from my own thoughts / emotions; and simply feel that I cannot be on this drug for the rest of my life. 2. MY WITHDRAWAL REGIME Procedure: Drop my dosage by 18.75 mg (XR) every two weeks. 4 months total time to get to zero. Divided 37mg pills into two parts to equal 18.75, depositing each part in new empty vegetable gel caps (available at health food store). In general: a. No caffeine -- not even decaffeinated coffee. b. No alcohol. c. Exercise every day (heartbeat up for 20 minutes or more). d. Steam Room / Sauna / Hot bath or long hot shower every day. e. 40-50 hour work weeks, nights / weekends off for ""down time"". Daily: a. Vitamins (one dosage each in the morning and night): B Complex (50 mg); C (100 mg); E (400 iu); Omega (200 mg); Glucosamine Sulfate; 8 glasses of water. b. Continued with my Trazodone medication for sleep during entire tapering process, took no Flexeril. Experience during each tapering of 18.75 mg: First 24 hours: no side effects. 48 hours: very bad day: grumpy, anger, rage (for someone relatively sweet natured); nausea, dizzy, balance problems, headache; when moving head too quickly would become nauseous; body pains, disrupted sleep with periodic nightmares. The main thing is to be as far from other people as possible since any conversation would rub me the wrong way. Asked wife to take nothing I say personally, agree with whatever I say, or simply ""get out of my way"". Eventually we found sending her away for the day shopping or whatever to be the best. On these days I would plan to do a lot of non - thinking busy work around the house: fix things, garden, etc. Spent extra time at gym and in steam room. 72 hours: very low energy, dopey, foggy, wanting to stay in bed, body pains. My energy would then slowly gain over the next few days. Some of the above side effects would appear briefly without warning between drops in dosage (anger, bad nights sleep, sluggish). Once at zero mg.: Symptoms: All of the above, but slightly increased in all areas. Acute allergy symptoms -- sneezing, headache, stuffed up from morning to night -- aches and pains. I took Benadryl during this time which helped a lot. Detox Period: Now I had to remove the toxins from Effexor from my body. Regime: a. Steam Room / Sauna / Hot bath or long hot shower twice every day--with cold shower breaks in between heat sessions to mimic the aspects of fever. b. cleanser: Triphila and Psyllium husk powder twice a day c. Dry brush my skin (the skin holds a 1/3 of the body is toxins) d. 5 day juice fast, with 2 days before and after of raw vegetables/fruits only. Stopped all medications, vitamins, benadryl, colon cleanser, everything during this juice fast. I scheduled the fast approximately 2 weeks after stopping Effexor. e. Exercise regime every day. 3. AM I NOW IN THE CLEAR? Here I am 4 weeks after the end of Effexor (and Trazadone -- which I replaced with melatonin). I continue to take vitamins and will do so for quite a while. So .. How am I feeling? - I do not have words to describe how wonderful it is to have my feelings, emotions and mind back, where I feel that my moods are my own and not manufactured by Effexor. - Allergies continue to haunt me daily, but each day it gets a bit better, and I take less benadryl. - No need to remember pill times is wonderful, less dry mouth. - Still a bit ""low energy"", but it gets better each day. - Mood is upbeat, feeling hopeful and looking forward to clear windshields everyday! I hope this help those of you out there planning to come off this drug. I am grateful for Effexor for all it has done to help me over the years. I wished they warned me about the withdrawal. I am grateful for all your suggestions and comments that helped me research and put this regime into place. It worked for me and I probably would not change a thing if I were to do it again.","I hope it will be a help for you preparing to come off Effexor 1.
Length of Time of Effexor: 5.5 years b.
d. Other medications: Flexeril (periodically over the years but not in past year when things are ""bad""); Trazodone, for sleep; vitamins and herbs as needed.
f. Reasons to Come Off: Generally feeling better with the help of physiotherapist; life situation has become low-stress and stabile (secure job, good marriage, work from home); side effects of Effexor becoming irritating, especially the emotional distance from my own thoughts / emotions; and simply feel that I cannot be on this drug for the rest of my life.
2. MY WITHDRAWAL REGIME Procedure: Drop my dosage by 18.75 mg (XR) every two weeks.
e. 40-50 hour work weeks, nights / weekends off for ""down time"".
Vitamins (one dosage each in the morning and night): B Complex (50 mg); C (100 mg); E (400 iu); Omega (200 mg); Glucosamine Sulfate; 8 glasses of water.
48 hours: very bad day: grumpy, anger, rage (for someone relatively sweet natured); nausea, dizzy, balance problems, headache; when moving head too quickly would become nauseous; body pains, disrupted sleep with periodic nightmares.
On these days I would plan to do a lot of non - thinking busy work around the house: fix things, garden, etc.
e. Exercise regime every day.
- Allergies continue to haunt me daily, but each day it gets a bit better, and I take less benadryl.

"I am the funny guy. When I am near people I love (anybody that shows a moderate amount of affection towards me) I always try to bring them up. Life sucks for all of us. I just want to make people happy. I have always been pretty good at telling jokes, which is weird since I am super introverted and if I am not joking I am super quiet. The problem is that no one knows when I am telling the truth. I will try to come out to people. I will try to tell them about my drug abuse. I will try to tell them about who I am. Nobody wants to listen. Everyone assumes that the funny guy is just fine. Nobody wants to have a genuine conversation because sometimes I am a real fucking downer. So yeah.

"If you do not want periods (or PMS) at all there is the 3 monthly injection - Depo-provera - in the UK. It does not work the same for everyone (like all medicines) but for me it stopped all periods and kept my depression down to such a level that I could function ""normally"". I stopped having the 1 week mood swings, 1 week misery, 1 week mood swings, 1 week ok cycle. If that is not an option for you there is a herb supplement that I tried called Agnus Castus. It seems to have beneficial effects for most ""women is problems"" from aching breasts to full blown menopause. And it can have the side effect of weight loss (not a bad thing for me ) I was on it for ten years at a time and got to the stage where when I came off it and had a period again I had completely forgotten what they were really like! And things have wings now. The PMS did not cause my depression but it certainly did not help it.

"I am always wrong.. I got married with a wrong man. I have been married for 5 years. I have a baby who is still a month. I realized that i chose the wrong person as husband. He ruined my life. He ruined my inside. He cheats on me while i was pregnant. But he does not think he did bad things to me. When i said something, he always says that I am stupid or crazy. He thinks he is right.

I have a baby but he does not support me. I have not realized he is such a bad man.. He has hidden so many things from me.. So i thought he is a good husband. But he brought financial issues. And i have helped it. But he forgot that.. I want to leave him but i do not have money and i have a baby.. And I am in different country.. No one is by my side. I cut myself almost every day. I have stopped it since i was 20. But situations make me do that. I would never wear short sleeve again. Too much scars. But i do not regret to cut myself. Because that is the only way to make me live. Maybe people say easy that i should get a divorce or just leave him or ask my family. But that is not easy. I have tried to end my life many times after i moved here. But I am failed. I hope one day i can be gone. Life is so unfair. I do not want to live this life anymore.

"Feeling Trapped Hello, I am 22 and had quite severe depression during the age of 17-18. My past 3 years of life from the ages 19-22 have actually been great and I have had no problems. I have had a girlfriend since the age of 20 whom I love. I have worked a few different mundane jobs, and have been going to school for electrical engineering. I am entering my last year of undergraduate school in the ASU online program. The reason my depression has returned is because I feel trapped, mainly due to my living situation. I would consider my upbringing to be the low end of middle class, and yes I realize there are people much worse off than I am. I grew up in a family of 6, 2 parents and 4 siblings including myself. For the past 18 years we have lived in an 1800 sq. ft. town house in California, right off of a busy street. There are 2 rooms in the house. The master bedroom is rather large, I would estimate about 2.5x as big as the other bedroom. Up until a few months ago when my sister moved out, all 4 of us siblings were sharing the smaller room. Now there are 3 of use sharing it, but still two bunk beds taking up the same space. There is absolutely no space, and I am 6'3"" tall and do not really fit into my twin size bunk bed. My mom has kept the large master bedroom for herself over the years, and has forced my father to sleep in the living room, despite the fact that he is the one who pays the bills. She is a selfish person. My desk, which is where I try to study and work, and where I spend most of my time, is in the living room. My dad is usually in the living room watching TV, and there are lots of noise and distractions from other people and the kitchen etc. which make it nearly impossible to study or just relax. This did not really bother me much as a kid, but now that I am 22, it is getting worse and worse everyday. Because I do online schooling (which was not what I intended) , I have little to no interaction with peers and my schooling is basically sitting in front of my computer at home. I feel completely trapped. The bedroom I share is completely cramped, and usually one of my other siblings is in it. In the living room I am surrounded by distractions and other people, with absolutely no privacy. It is hard to study or focus on anything. I feel like I have no space to myself, like there is nowhere to go. I often feel extremely anxious and depressed, and feel as though someone is cramming me into a box. This makes me just want to cease being conscious. All I think about is how badly I need to move out. Every night it is getting worse and worse, until I decided to come here tonight to post. Due to school payments, and buying a car, it is not possible to move out with the mediocre job that I have. There is still another year until I graduate school, and even then I do not know for certain if I will be able to get a job that will enable me to move out. I will still have to pay off school loans after that. The thought of staying here for another year, or even worse 2-3 years is completely unbearable. My girlfriend and I have made plans to move out together eventually, but that probably would not happen for another 2 years minimum. This had made me extremely depressed and anxious the past 6 months. Does anyone have any advice for what I should do? I have been considering spending more time at libraries during the day. I have also been trying to spend a little more time outside and at the gym etc. But if anyone else has been in a similar situation, please give me advice. Note: I know there are people who have it much worse. Homeless, disabled, etc. I realize that and that is the main thing that I try to think about when I feel depressed and anxious. That I have it better than some people. But this is just my personal situation I am trying to deal with.","Feeling Trapped Hello, I am 22 and had quite severe depression during the age of 17-18.

"I have always felt different, i guess i am a little weird, loner gay, but at the same time smart loving, people admire me and respect me . i felt depression back in 96. tried different medications, until, effexor worked for me, then i felt good for several years now depression has come back again, and with much vengeance. it took my soul and mind, I am back with my partner after a short break up which i think caused the monster to come back, i lost motivation in life and i called my ex to come back into my life since i was feeling suicidal, he claims he loves and will be there for me, and he has been a great deal of support for me. i am taking cymbalta for 4 weeks now but my doctor says it will take 2 more weeks until we decide which medication i should stay with. in the meantime there are suicidal thoughts, running in my head as well as some of hope. i would hate to miss out on my son is high school graduation, or my own graduation from the RN program. as a nurse i know that there is hope, but no matter how much knowledge you have you will always feel lost and helpless when depression is in your body. my message is that we should be patient and continue to do positive things because at the end, all this mess in our heads, will only seem like a period of time where we were sleeping or we blanked out, i am hurting so much and i know there are many more hurting out there, but let is be kind to ourselves and give ourselves words of appreciation and affection, over and over, take care of yourselves and be PATIENT, just like i will be.

"I feel like depression has turned my brain into mush and now I cannot be successful in anything Last year I stopped being productive at work and it is now seeping into the rest of my life.

"I am not able to do breath meditation myself, so I am a fine one to talk, but I have read that it works. The thoughts will come, no matter what you do. Supposedly the trick with breath mediation is that it gives you distance on the thoughts, helps you ""stand back"" from them a bit, and feel the accompanying emotions but not get as carried away by them. This reinforces your ability to know that they are just thoughts, and they will go away if you do not act on them. And supposedly either with breath meditation or without, there is an element of ""fake it till you make it"" at work here. It is been shown that ""acting out anger"" as a therapeutic tool actually makes getting angry easier than letting go of it, because it maintains the neurological pathways that anger uses. One meditation teacher calls it ""rehearsing anger"". So supposedly if you replace negative thoughts/feelings with positive ones, like caring for the part of you that is angry and hurt, then eventually your brain will reprogram itself to think and feel positive things. Breath meditation has become a non-religious phenomenon in recent years, like yoga. Three books that are just good reading anyway are ""The Art of Happiness"" by the psychiatrist Howard Cutler with the Dalai Lama, ""Destructive Emotions - How Can We Overcome Them?"", by the psychologist Daniel Goleman with the Dalai Lama, and ""Anger- Wisdom For Cooling The Flames"", by Thich Nhat Hanh, all of which discuss breath meditation as a simple practice for ""mental hygiene"" as opposed to a ""religious practice"" of any sort. Supposedly the Dalai Lama was really surprised to hear that ""self-loathing"" is common in Western culture, because it was so uncommon in Tibet- there was just no concept. The point of all this is, with or without meditation, is that if you notice a negative thought or emotion when it arises, rather than struggle with it to try to put it out of your mind, you should just quietly label it as ""negative thought"" and let it go away, and/or replace it with a positive thought, like ""caring for the wounded child within you"". (It is odd to notice that John Bradshaw, the ""king"" of ""healing the wounded child"", and Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, say the same thing about this.) But it is being said that there is a great similarity between Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and meditation practice, because meditation practice recognizes negative self-talk and replaces it with positive self-talk, and supposedly conditions the brain to react in positive ways. In ""Destructive Emotions"" there is a part about brain imaging that shows that people who meditate are activating more positive parts of their brains. And again, these books are just good reading anyway. But like I say, easier said than done. Supposedly it works for some people. I cannot do it, but some people can. Maybe you can. If nothing else, all these works, including Bradshaw, are good reading and you may be able to develop positive mental habits and replace the negative mental habits with them. Both breath meditation and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy have been shown to be good adjuncts to recovery from depression, even if the depression itself is being treated with medication.","So supposedly if you replace negative thoughts/feelings with positive ones, like caring for the part of you that is angry and hurt, then eventually your brain will reprogram itself to think and feel positive things.

I am good at the Engineering subjects (Physics, Chemistry and Math) and I like CS but I have never really enjoyed doing it. Do not get me wrong, I am not bad at studying. I am among the top kids at my school. Everybody thinks I have my life figured out and somehow that just makes it worse. I am fucking terrified of what the future holds. I stay up whole nights crying just going over what is going to happen and trying to achieve some sort of clarity about what I am going to do. I have tons of friends at school but I have never connected with anyone. There was this one guy I was really good friends with and had a crush on since 6th grade but he changed schools last year and we lost touch. I have tried making actual new friends since then but it is never clicked with anyone. There are good days and bad days, the latter consisting of me drawing all the curtains in my room, turning off the lights, wrapping myself in my blanket and just laying there in the dark. It embarrasses me to admit that that is what I am doing right now. I really want to go to college in the US just to experience something new for once but med school is really expensive. I just want to feel happy about something for once. Why does nothing interest me anymore? I feel like a robot going through the same routine everyday. Eat, study, sleep, repeat. I just want to be happy.","I feel so lost Hi. I am 15 year old girl from India and I have no idea what I am doing with my life.

"I just love sleeping Just getting in my covers and wrap myself in a blanket. Everything is dark and my body is resting. I wish I could be there all my life. I dream, sometimes, but normally I do not dream. And that is when I am the happiest. I just feel like I am dead and have no problems. Just the ritual of wrapping myself and then getting comfortable is the only thing to make me smile. I then daydream, and in that state where I am conscious but not enough to acknowledge my problems, I fall asleep. But then there comes tomorrow, and sometimes I wish I could have stayed awake all night to avoid waking up and facing reality, but then I remember I love sleeping. Sadly, it is another day and I have to get out of bed.","I just love sleeping Just getting in my covers and wrap myself in a blanket.

"Do you ever feel like why bother we are all going to die anyhow and all we have accomplished and done will be forgotten? I enjoy art, but I often think why bother. I will die one day and all my art work will be thrown away. There is a lot I do enjoy but none of it serves any purpose. After you go on vacation for example you are just left with the memories, until you get old and forget it all. Sure it was fun at the moment but serves no long term purpose and one day even the memories will be gone. They say enjoy life but why? Animals do not. They just do what they do. They are only purpose is to keep their species alive and technically that is our only purpose in life to keep our species going. Maybe if we did not spend so much time focusing on life and enjoying it we would actually be happier people and more accepting of pending doom.

"Help, I am not sure if my partner is depressed. I need help moving forward. A little background on my partner and our relationship, he is 23 and I am 21. He lost his mother to sickness when he was 17 years old, dropped out of school because of that and moved away to complete a foundation course. We met while he was back home but he currently studies overseas to complete his bachelor is degree. However, he is been home for the past 2.5 weeks as he is having his semester break. We began dating a year and 2 months ago. He is been nothing but the most supportive and kind partner I have ever had the honour of dating. Very caring, remembers the little things and is very physically affectionate. However for the past 2.5 weeks, he is been incredibly hot and cold with me. The worst instance having been on Thursday (4 days ago). We had planned to meet at 2pm, but at 2pm he asks if we can meet at 5pm because nothe weather is too hot'. Fair enough, so we decide to meet at 5pm. When I meet him, he is cold and withdrawn and does not even acknowledge me. I reach for his hand and he lets me hold it, but the bus ride is filled with nothing but silence. He is looking out the window and he does not want to speak to me. We reach our destination and head to a restaurant for early dinner, but he orders one tiny dish and does not want to eat anymore because he has no appetite. I asked him what is wrong and he said he is just tired. I asked if he is angry at me and he says no. He continues being very physically affectionate by holding my hand and holding my waist but he does not want to make eye contact with me or kiss me. He smiles all of 2 times while we are out. We then decide to head to a bar (his decision, even though I told him I am okay with going home), but we just drank our beers in silence, I tried telling him about a book I had just bought but I could tell he was disinterested. While on the way back home, I teared up while telling him that I have been trying so hard to communicate with him but I have just not gotten a response. He tells me that he is tired and it is got nothing to do with me. We head back home and I tell him to text me when he is back home but he does not. It is been 4 days since then and I texted him last night but to no response (it is been 24 hours). Other reasons why I think he may be depressed are:- A week before he came home, he found out his dog of 13 years passed away. \- He has a very erratic sleep schedule. He will sleep at 5am, wake up at noon. \- He does not want to do things that we planned to do. We wanted to go for an exhibition and he said we will go 'next week' but that has not happened yet. \- We have not had sex in a week. \- He has not met his best friend of a few years even though he is been home for 2.5 weeks. \- He has not made contact with me for 4 days, this is out of the ordinary. \- He is totally checked out of social media, not stayed up to date with memes and Instagram stories (with the only exception being last night when he watched my Instagram story) \- His Instagram and Twitter bio is ""Have fun. Be kind. Die."" (!!) I feel so lost and helpless, and I feel like I am grasping at straws trying to figure out what is going on. I do not know if this could be depression or if it is just a case of him checking out of this relationship. If any of these signs are an indicator, please please please let me know what I can do. I feel especially on edge because he is leaving to go back to uni in a few days but I do not know when I will be able to see him again. I do not know how to reach out to him, he did not respond to my text message and the last thing I want to do is shove him deeper into isolation. Please give me any advice you can on how to go about dealing with the situation.

I am new here. Decided to look up some info on the withdrawal effect of Effexor and decided that it was time to check out support as well. I have suffered from depression since I was very young but was not diagnosed until my early twenties (I am 33 now) I was not medicated until my husband decided he did not want to be married anymore and the bottom fell out of my life. At the time I needed something to help balance me out a bit. I should have been medicated a long time ago I still have times where it hits me but not nearly as severe as it used to. I describe it as my black cloud coming over me. I tell people when it is there as I am very open about my depression as I feel it may help someone else.,At the time I needed something to help balance me out a bit.

"God giveth and God taketh away, but lately he seems to just be taking from me. I am tired of it all now. A little over a year ago my Grandfather who lived with us passed away. About 6 months ago my mother passed away. A week ago my father went into the hospital to have open heart surgery done on him, and today he came back and is definitely looking worse for wear. For the time being he cannot do anything physical, cannot drive, and just looks like he is in pain, and is talking about probably retiring. Meanwhile in my life i am struggling between choosing to go off to college or getting a full-time job. Only just a week ago I was getting ready to start to apply to FAFSA in preparation for actually starting college this year -- now with recent developments i am not sure if that is even a viable option. I will probably need to stay home and help out by getting a full-time job since both me and my brother are reliant on my dad financially, and my brother is already in college. I really do not know what I want to do or what I even can do. Add onto more shallow but personal reasons for me to feel down, like the fact that I have no social life to speak of and honestly it is enough to make me seriously consider suicide. It all just feels hopeless to me, and I do not even really feel like living to see what the future holds because it feels as though it is all bleak in the long term.","A little over a year ago my Grandfather who lived with us passed away.

I have a bad personality that appears good. My personality is a result of childhood abuse and depression. I was treated like a subordinate not worthy of shit growing up and now as an adult I am a people pleaser to the extent of ruining my own life to help others even if they dont need it because I worry about my reputation and want people to constantly think I am a really good person. I know that it is not good behaviour but I do not know how to be outside of that.

"Gets worse by the day lately Lately.. the depression has been getting worse as each new day arrives. It is getting to the point where I am afraid of my own mind and thoughts. Lately I have been hoping that i do not wake up from my sleep. In the past six months, I have lost two people that I loved so much. One was my best friend of 8 years, we dated for a year and broke up but remained friends until about six months ago. He started to ignore me out of no where. Tried my best to talk to him but.. he was the cause of why my depression spiraled back so bad that I almost took my own life. Then I met another guy about 5 months earlier.. he liked me, I liked him, I fell in love with him. He knew of my ex/best friend and what he did to me. Guy number two said he would not do what guy number one did to me.. and now I feel like he is doing the same exact thing that guy number one did to me.. we have not talked in two weeks. I know two weeks is not that long to not talk, but.. seeing as guy number one did not talk to me for two weeks.. I cannot help that guy number two is doing the same exact thing and ignoring me and somehow I will lose him as friend. Sadly.. I fell really hard for guy number two..

"I think letters are a wonderful way to communicate. That way you do not say anything without thinking about it first. I was not clear if your mother actually read the letter or not. If she has not, I might suggest approaching the letter with just the first issue of the way she treats you (without the father issue) in one letter. That might open dialogue and allow you guys to focus on fixing that first. I understand your fear of authority figures. When I was that age (I am 31 now) I could not talk to anyone of authority. My mom, who was shy herself had to do that kind of stuff for me. Could another one of your relatives go with you to take your drivers test? Nana or Sonny who you mentioned in the letter? If it helps to hear, I did get over my fear of authority figures and sometimes I go overboard and challenge them (to make up for lost time?). I never had psychotherapy, but I wish I had. So do not discount it, nip it in the bud if you are able to. One other question I have is..is your mother ALWAYS this way or does she show moments of tenderness, sympathy or interest in your life? I think that if you have seen the mom in her in the past, it sounds like she has some internal problems that she takes out on you, but have nothing to do with you. Do not worry about how you should be at this age..everyone has their own time clock inside. If we were all the same, this would be a very very boring world.

"GF stopped taking antidepressants So my LDR girlfriend just recently stopped taking antidepressants because her mother pressured her into it. She clearly needs them, she can barely function without them and I told her but she refuses to take them again. Her mother, by the way, is bipolar and very mentally abusive. It seems like my GF had been convinced by her mother that not taking meds is the way to go. I told my parents about this and they agree with her not taking them, claiming it will help the chemicals leave her body. I do not know what to do. I want to support her decision but her getting off her meds is clearly affecting her negatively and she is even sadder and less motivated to do anything now. It is currently impossible for us to live together and we visit each other 1-2 times a year when school is out. We are both in uni. I myself stopped taking antidepressants cold turkey as well (that was about 5 years ago) and I am still depressed but not to the point where I cannot go out and do what I am supposed to like she is experiencing right now. I love her and want to be with her forever but I do not know how to help at this point, she is not receptive to my help and hates herself and has no friends where she lives, a small town in Canada.","It seems like my GF had been convinced by her mother that not taking meds is the way to go.

"What ambitions are left to aspire to if you do not want kids? I am a 27 male surrounded by mombies and a culture that I do not fit into. I feel like I have accomplished all my very serious ambitions from graduating college to studying in grad school and withdrawing, twice. (I was doing fine in grad school, they were job prep program. School Psych and a teacher prep program. I withdrew basically because I was apathetic about the job goals/mission. I studied philosophy/psychology during my undergrad and I feel extremely content with all the knowledge I have accumulated, but it just feels like I am getting old. It feels like friends are moving away, the world is getting smaller, less wondrous. It is like realizing I am too old to aspire to great things like being an astronaut or something. I feel like my role models are way too big, or that things are just downhill from here. So I am asking myself questions like why bother working? Why bother moving forward? Maybe I am pessimistic and think the US political situation is horrible and it is affecting me. But I wonder how older people without kids keep going forward. What pushes them? I firmly do not want my career to be my only reason to live. I do not want to live to work.","I feel like I have accomplished all my very serious ambitions from graduating college to studying in grad school and withdrawing, twice.

"I am convinced money CAN buy happiness. Can it fix everything? No. It would fix my life. Money would be freedom, safety, comfort. Money would give me back control of my life.

"This is a really great forum and nice to know there are other men out there willing to help as they know what it is like. It is also funny how sometimes what you think you are doing and what other perceive are totally different. For example, my wife has recently stated that she feels like she is living in a ""glass jar."" What she means it that due to my depression and anxiety she, at times, feels like she has to act or say things differently because of how she thinks I am going to interpret them. Whereas all I want is for her to act normal and do and act as she was and let me deal with the insecurities and issues. I hope this is making some sense to some of you and if so, any suggestions on what to do? Thanks!","For example, my wife has recently stated that she feels like she is living in a ""glass jar.""

"Becoming fat Perhaps due to my meds (some of them have side effects pertaining to increase in appetite and weight gain), and perhaps due to my ridiculous comfort eating, I have become fat.

Exercise and the lot do not work - in fact I have exercised 30 minutes or more every day in the last 1.5 month - after all I am not a young person, I do not do very strenuous exercise and my metabolism is probably low.

"I read ""The Art of Happiness"" a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it. The Dalai Lama is something else. I have forgotten a lot of it but I do remember him saying that we should strive to be unswayed by emotion so that we do not differentiate between good things happening or bad things. I am the opposite of this. When good things happen I feel good. When bad things happen I feel bad. I loved what you said about there being no such thing as self loathing in Tibet. I wonder if this means there is no depression. I have always wanted to be a monk. Maybe that is the answer. Thanks for the interesting post Harlequin. I will now go and Google breathing meditation.

I watched a video of her earlier. Happy and giddy with excitement. She jumped around and kicked her legs, unable to contain her excitement. She was so happy and full of enjoyment. But seeing her be so happy without me has put me in a state of deep depression since. Even typing though his out is painful.

Feeling nostalgic? Does anyone else obsess over a point of time in their life when they felt like they were truly happy? For me the last time in my life when I felt like I was truly happy was 2013 and 2014 (mostly the summers) Ever since then life has changed so much. My depression got worse than ever. I spend so much time reminiscing on the good times because life is so crappy now. Does it ever get better again or what? I keep telling myself this is just a stage and things will get good again but it just seems to get worse.

"Finished my goodbye letters. Would just like to vent a little before I hang up my hat.. For the last two months I went through hell with my relationship to my GF that I was planning on proposing to right before this all began. Since May she is been telling me how she is depressed and does not know why and that our relationship is failing because of it. I did absolutely everything I could to help even changing so many things about myself. This went on for over a month until she said we needed to take a break which we began to and for the next month we were on and off yet still living together and in my eyes things were turning around for the better. Well, June 29th I found out the reason for all this was that she was talking to a co-worker that lives down the street and began sleeping with him while I was at work. Unfortunately I snapped and went to confront the guy which she blocked the door from me leaving and I just ripped it open hitting her with the door not even thinking bruising her shoulder. 4 days later she calls the cops and 2 days after that I am arrested for domestic battery. We were planning a life together and I have never felt so betrayed. After a couple days I began to see the light and once I did my mother had a heart attack and I cannot help but blame myself for putting her through all this stress. Normally if I had family problems I would turn to Kaitlyn my GF and if I had GF problems I would speak to my mother or my brother who lives half way across the country. Well, now I have no one to turn to and I am spiralling out of control. Last night I spent a few hours writing my goodbyes and have been collecting a variety of sleeping pills and muscle relaxers. Im gonna try and enjoy the next couple days and then I am pulling all my money out of the bank to go find a beautiful scenery and make that my last memory. You have always been a huge help Reddit over the last few years but this is my breaking point.

It really hurts me that he does this, because he knows I have bad mental health, but he only makes me feel worse about it by making me feel worse about myself.

I am tired of school, I am tired of feeling inadequate compared to my friends who are moving on to bigger and better things, I am tired of feeling like a disappointment to my family, and I am tired of the shitty life I feel like I have. Yet the thing I am most tired of is being unable to find any consistent motivation in my life, never truly feeling motivated to do or finish anything, just letting any and everything just pass me by. It makes me hate myself even more thinking about all the things I could do if I could just find some motivation or will to be better.",-
"How much longer can I fake it? I am 33, had a full-time job for several years and have a young son. I took a leave from work in 2014 for mental illness, at which point I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, prescribed Zoloft and was back at work when my short term disability ran out. This was the first time I would been on anti-depressants. I felt tired all the time, had no sex drive, and started gaining weight, but at least I was functional. Over the next year, I received a few verbal warnings and 1 written warning at work about my poor performance. Eventually, the mask broke and I was on leave again in 2015. This time I was away for much longer, was diagnosed w/ dysthymia, tried several different medications, found out that just about every SSRI gave me horrible side effects (sweating, nausea, insomnia, no sex drive, I am actually thinking now that maybe they caused serotonin syndrome) and eventually landed on Remeron and Wellbutrin. This combo actually started to work, without any side effects (except for weight gain, which I have been managing with a diet now). This time, I returned to work because I received notice in the mail that my employment was going to be terminated because it was coming up on 2 years without being at work. I figured if I was going to be fired for not returning, I may as well return, make some money and worst thing that happens is I get fired anyways. I was not better when I returned to work, I was functional, I was able to smile, but the low mood persisted in a big way. And so here I am, still working, trying to fake it everyday, feeling like a house of cards thats ready to topple. I am afraid because if I go off work again that will have been 3 leaves of absence, and I really do not think I could show my face around here anymore after that. I remember how horrible my life felt when I was on medical leave. I remember falling behind on child support, having to borrow money from my parents. I remember trying to convince my girlfriend that my low sex drive was because of meds and not because of her. I remember trying to convince an insurance company that I am sick, while simultaneously trying to convince myself that I can get better. I remember feeling like a useless waste of skin that drained on the resources of everyone that dared to care about me. I guess what I am saying is I know, right now, I am suffering from depression, and I am afraid of what might happen if I admit that again.","I felt tired all the time, had no sex drive, and started gaining weight, but at least I was functional.

"today is my birthday Today is my birthday. 8th alone. 22 today, a number that i never would have thought i would reach. I bought some of my favorite snacks and got my old blanket, just going to watch some of my favorite movies today. I also bought a card for myself ( which i do every year) , written on it was ""Happy Birthday, Love mum and dad"".. they were the last people to ever tell that to me and i know that even tho its been over a decade since they are gone, they were the last people to celebrate and be happy because of me, the last people to love me. i miss them so much. I get so lonely, its hard to cope sometimes, i wish i could spend more time with them. I love you mum and dad EDIT 1: Thank you all so much for the wishes, it really means a lot. this is the most i have gotten in years. Really made my day, been struggling to cope especially in the last few months, everything is just hitting like a train so thank you to all! Wish you all a good day EDIT 2: THANK YOU SO MUCH TO EVERYONE! You are all such awesome people. I cannot express how thankful i am and how this has been my best birthday in years, i feel like a kid again. i have not smiled more in the past years. It brings tears to my eyes to receive so many thoughtful messages and support, all of you are just great! Hearts of gold. Thank you. Thank you. And to everyone in this subreddit I have finally found my bit of happiness, all thanks to you! I no longer feel alone, and you should not either! Theres so many good people here on reddit.

"OK, for you guys out there- I apologize ahead of time.. It is that time of the month for me - and I thought I was doing pretty well until this afternoon. It is like my hormones, brain chemicals and whatever else have done a complete 180 on me. Driving home today I prayed I would just make it safely because I was starting to feel so out of control. I want to scream (which I cannot because of where I live) or break things- or whatever else to get this anger out!! I do not even know where it is coming from!! All I know is everything is pissing me off!! Has anyone else ever felt like this? What do you do? I cannot cry- the tears will not come. I am thinking about watching a show I like, but I do not seem to like anything right now. Also, I am supposed to be working from home right now, which is the last thing I want to do. I just want to take some Klonopin and make myself chill and go to sleep. I will not, though, because I am still feeling responsible at this moment, despite my feelings of rage. I just want to get rid of these feelings!! Any ideas??","OK, for you guys out there- I apologize ahead of time..

"I am 16 and I have thought about suicide some, never tried yet. I will tell you about myself. I am in high school .. just got my license. I have been to two shrinks, neither for depression but a anger problem, though I do not have one, just Mom and me fight and we have always been close. No one has ever known that I have thought of suicide except when I was in junior high and it was not really much true, sure a little but I was more agreeing with my cousin when she said that she has thought of such. Now I have been recently noticing (for a small bit months now) how I have been having some I guess you would say symptoms (pardon my spelling) of depression and all. Especially I have been losing interest in things and feeling guilty over everything and that is the most extreme ones, I have some others too. I have taken online tests and it says that I may have depression. But I cannot believe I do. I mean why would I have depression. I would just guess I am making it up to myself or something. We will I have always been interesting in psychology stuff like personality disorders, so maybe I am just reading into it wrong or something. That would probably be what a shrink would say so I do not want to go to one, plus I do not really like talking to them. Another thing is one of my friends just attempted suicide, lucky survived and if I say something to someone they would think I am just saying such because of that. I have felt like this before that though .. another thing is I am a Christian and Christians should not feel this way, right? Can someone help me figure out if I am just making this up in my head!!","Now I have been recently noticing (for a small bit months now) how I have been having some I guess you would say symptoms (pardon my spelling) of depression and all.

"I am a 33 year old man with a history of depression (I was diagnosed when I was 10) and of ""standing apart"" -- not refusing to fit in out of some sense of rebellion, but not fitting in simply because I could not. I have never been married. I have had only one long term relationship -- it was long - distance and very turbulent for both my partner and I (the relationship ended three years ago). To this day I wonder why I do not ""measure up"", why I cannot seem to find my place in life. While not physically stunning by any means, I never thought I was hideous, either -- though my looks have most often been pointed out to me as a shortcoming, so that is the explanation I tend to go with most of the time. When I hit my teenage years, panic disorder became a problem, too (as I realized how little control I had over my life and the way it was going to turn out). At the beginning of each year, I stand back and take stock of my situation, asking myself: where am I right now? Which direction am I headed in from here? What are my options? Up until now, I could always find some reason to be at least a little hopeful, to keep going -- but this year I cannot. I have been out of work for a long time, the panic attacks are getting bad again, I have had a number of relatively minor but still worrisome health problems in the last few months -- and worst of all, after so many years, I am still alone. There are no prospects out there; no one wants to be with me. I am in a lot of pain and I do not know how to make it better. This is not just a temporary slump, it is my whole life, but it hurts even worse now than it used to.","When I hit my teenage years, panic disorder became a problem, too (as I realized how little control I had over my life and the way it was going to turn out).

I do not know why I thought that I was ok. Maybe because I had been drug free in my treatment for the last 2 1/2 yrs, or because things did not seem so chaotic this time before someone noticed I was ""different""?

"My mother pt.2 I posted about my issues with my mother the other day, and I have discovered new information. She is been complaining to her boyfriend, and he has a busy mouth, so naturally he is spilled it all. I have learned that my mother never wanted me to move back in with her after I lost my apartment, and she is been saying she buys me lots of things: clothes, computers, etc. And I just toss them aside and never use them, because I am an ungrateful child. So she just took the stuff and started wearing the clothes. None of that is true. What is probably going on here is that she is buying herself things, and using me as a scapegoat so she does not have to tell her boyfriend she has money, or bought things for herself. Or she is just delusional and making shit up. Maybe even that she is stealing clothes from me and covering that way. I could believe any of that. Either way, she wants me to leave, and I know she does. And that hurts like a mother. No pun intended. What I want to do is get custody of my younger brother, and leave the state. Just start over, and make sure my brother is raised in a safe and nurturing environment. Because I cannot live with knowing that he is growing up in the same toxicity that I did, and how it will fuck him up like it did me. She is two-facing everyone; talking shit to one person, then smiling to the person is face she just trashed. And if anyone tries to call her out, she gets pissed and plays dumb. Her sugar daddies have been showing up at the house. She does drugs on the daily. She is going to end up old, a lone, and with her kids and family hating her, no one coming to see her. I am ready to disown her. It just hurts. Why is she like this? Why does it have to be this way?

"Why did they forget me? I was never someone people would consider anti-social. Rather, I was the opposite. I loved talking to people, meeting new people, and just being social. In highschool, I never had a ""group"" of friends per se, but I knew almost everyone in my grade, and was friends with a lot of them. After high school, I went to a local university, so I would have to commute to my school, unlike the rest of my classmates who went to to schools further away. My current university is a huge commuter school, so there is no on campus experience to be had, and I am actually transferring to a local community college instead, so I can transfer out later. Through all this, the friends I had in high school have all kind of forgotten about me. Even in high school, I would be the first to message people, or the one to initiate hangouts and whatnots. But now, in college, its the same but so much more lonely. All my friends are away, and I am rotting here. I feel so alone. On top of this, I miss my ex from a year ago. We went from meeting, to best friends, to huge fallout, to reconciliation, to best friends, to dating, to nothing. I miss the friend part. This loss has dampened my mood for a year now. Just overall, I feel so lonely. A year ago I felt on top of the world, and now, I am back to shit. All I ever wanted was someone to message me first saying ""Hey dude, how are ya?"" Its been a while"". The worst was Thanksgiving break, where I had excitedly messaged a few people saying I am so happy to see them and we (read: I asked to) made plans to hangout. A lot of them fell through. Others postponed till Christmas break. I messaged 28 people one day, desperate to talk to someone. I feel like I will never be anyone is ""everything"" ya know? I want a dog. Not just because its cute and all, but I want a companion that will never forget me, and will love me. I hate myself. Depression sucks. Loneliness sucks.

"Hello. I am a 40 year-old woman, and I am feeling quite lost right now. I have always been sort of depressed, but have never been given a formal diagnosis. That may change tomorrow. I have an appointment with a shrink. My psychiatrist put me on Prozac 3 years ago. I was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 34, and needed some help getting past that. I am adopted (a biggie for relationship issues), was married at the age of 18, had 3 kids by the time I was 40, and I am having a hard time transitioning to my new stage in life (sort of empty nest syndrome, I guess) I should be thrilled with my life. I make oodles of money, my kids are all fairly successful & just about on their own, but I am miserable. My husband and I are in a sort of ""friendship"" relationship, I could care less if he stays or goes. I started having panic attacks after my 40th birthday few weeks ago; I actually thought I was having a heart attack. So now, I am on 30 mg Prozac & .05 Klonadine (1/2 pill at a time) 3 times a day. I cannot quit crying. So.. how long does a psychology test take. How long will it take for them to diagnose me with something? These drugs are not doing a whole lot.

"I have never liked myself. Honestly, I think that my entire life I have been depressed, but now that I am older (19 y/o), I have realized what it actually is.

I always envied just about everyone else and thought the worst about myself and every action I took. The only time I *ever* felt happy about myself was after a psilocybin mushroom trip. But that is besides the point. I have always hated myself but I was too naive to know what it was and I thought it was normal. Why cannot I be normal?

I would rather be depressed and suicidal because at least I know it is real. It is not some bullshit fleeting feeling that I get that leads to disappointment.

"Depressed people get sick, too; How stigma in the medical community made me sicker I have often found myself in a chicken and egg situation with my doctors when it comes to depression. When I say I am sick, they are too quick to assume the depression is the cause of my pain and not the other way around. After five minutes listening to me breathe, looking into my throat, and and touching the outside of my neck, they are stumped so it must be mental illness. It got the the point that when I was having severe abdominal pain, I did not go to the hospital. I had to push for any kind of testing, which took forever. When I finally found a doctor who listened to me, she told me I should have gone to the ER. Then I was depressed about that; I had let the other doctors make me doubt my own sanity. Turns out, I have been pretty sick and needed surgery. Nearly all of the issues they blamed on depression were due to a chronic, painful illness with no cure. It is bittersweet, I have solved a big piece of the puzzle for sure. But I am still struggling a lot. I just found out that I may be infertile. After my doctor said having a baby could help my condition. So that was depressing too. (I do not think my depression caused my infertility. Checkmate, doctors!) I did start seeing a psychiatrist, and he is a kind man. He diagnosed me with depression and anxiety. He has never suggested that my depression is the cause of my physical problems, and he seems to be sympathetic to me as a chronic pain patient. He is given me depression medication, but I do not know how much it is helping. Chronic illness is a thing that happens to people and it is just *depressing*. I have always had depression, but this just makes it worse. He has never dismissed me for feeling that way or written off my pain as being in my head. Just wanted to share my experience with others who might understand. People with depression can experience health issues and get dismissed so easily. It took me years and years to get anywhere. It is a struggle to cope with both mental and physical illness. Here is to getting through today, friends.","When I say I am sick, they are too quick to assume the depression is the cause of my pain and not the other way around.

"My long-term relationship ended without a breakup conversation. My bf just ghosted me and stopped talking to me without any explanation. I am feeling very depressed and need some advice? I (22/f) found out through Instagram that my long-term bf (23/m) was cheating on me with multiple women. I have noticed the last month together he is been distant and acting strangely. Now all his strange behavior makes sense. After I found out I texted him letting him know that I found out about the cheating and that I lost all respect for him. He did not even bother responding or giving me a call. There was no text back, no phone call back. Zero conversation. I sent the text a week ago. I loved him so much and I cannot believe after all this time together he is just going to ghost me and leave me without a final conversation. Him ignoring me is so awful and selfish and is mind-boggling to me. I went ahead and deleted his number and deleted him off social media.

"Still recovering from ex-girlfriend To preface this, I am sure anyone who reads this has seen something similar on this sub a million times already. This is long and the last three paragraphs are my main point, the rest is just an explanation of my previous relationship. A little over a year ago my ex and I finally split after a long year and a half of on and offs filled with tons of emotional abuse. It was mainly her abusing me at first, getting angry for not texting her quickly enough, coming at my neck for hanging out with friends everynight ( I assume was because she stayed home all the time) and so on. The last couple times we dated she was always angry with me for cheating (which I never did) later to find out she was the one cheating on me. I was extremely depressed once we finally cut ties that I went back and talked to her and then she told me she cheated in detail so she could bring me down more. After the breakup I ended up getting sick and after a couple months could not even bring myself to take care of myself. Small stuff like wearing my retainer and showering before 5pm was the hardest part of my day. I know that seems small but it plays into how I feel now. 3 months after the breakup I started talking to a friend I met through my ex (however they were not and still are not friends anymore) and we have been happily together for almost a year now. There was a lot of useless drama with my ex about this which has been resolved but she still tries to harass me and my girlfriend. Last month she texted my phone from her friends number trying to harass me and it was just ridiculous. Unfortunately I have to see her in May for my girlfriend is prom, they are in the same senior class and I an currently a college sophomore. I still feel as though I am in a rough place and do not physically look as good as I should. Stuff such as my teeth and acne and other results of that loss of hygeine that I still struggle with makes me feel like I have been doing worse than her, which I know should not matter but it still bothers me. I have tried getting my old habits back which work for a month and then I lose track again. I guess my overall issue is I compare myself how I was when with her to where I am now, mostly with my appearance. I am also still very depressed and feel that it puts me below her now. My only real win is that I have nearly kicked my drug addiction (mainly weed, I was using it to runaway from my problems) but now I cannot seem too kick my other habits of nicotine addiction and taking any kind of pill or cough syrup just to not be sober. I have distanced myself from friends and I simply feel lost and useless to the world. In college I cannot make new friends and just sit in my dorm room wishing I could go back and start over so I could be healthier than I am now. I am looking for advice or anyone to be straightforward with me on any aspect of my situation. Thank you to anyone who reads this and responds!","It was mainly her abusing me at first, getting angry for not texting her quickly enough, coming at my neck for hanging out with friends everynight ( I assume was because she stayed home all the time) and so on.
3 months after the breakup I started talking to a friend I met through my ex (however they were not and still are not friends anymore) and we have been happily together for almost a year now.
Last month she texted my phone from her friends number trying to harass me and it was just ridiculous.
I have distanced myself from friends and I simply feel lost and useless to the world."
"I am the person everyone refers to when they say ""There is always someone worse."" Extremely stupid; embarassing myself on a daily basis with my poor IQ and lack of understanding anything. Lost a VOLUNTEER job because I am an idiot and kept screwing things up, and everybody wanted me gone. Ca not control my own pet dog, in too much trouble. Financially in a dangerous situation. Unable to find a single thing in life I am good at, and therefore enjoy. Forever single due to my weird nature and orientation. Losing connection with family members due to my questionable morality. Cannot find work that will suit my long-term heart and breathing issue. No motivation to do anything anymore. Cannot do basic tasks. I cannot even lace my shoes properly.","Unable to find a single thing in life I am good at, and therefore enjoy.

"I thought things were getting better.. Sorry for the little rant.. I just needed to say this somewhere. After recently getting out of the hospital for a(nother) attempt at my life, I was surrounded by family and friends who want to support me. For a couple days this almost gave me a high, thinking that maybe I really am glad I was not able to go through with it or that maybe I was beating these years of depressiveness. Not even just after a week of getting out of the mental ward, I fantasize about what I could have done differently to have made sure I died that night. Going forward I thought I would be happy being able to see my younger siblings and my dog again, yet the only thing I can think of is them knowing I tried killing myself, and that I have added just another thing to deal with and another burden on them. I will now be treated with *care* and people will be on guard around me, and I did not want to do that to them. This semester has started again and I have already missed the first week, and while part of me just wants to drop everything, I cannot afford to start paying back the loans. I just want to curl into a ball and not exist and have to deal with it all. TLR - trying to take the easy way out has just made everything harder.","After recently getting out of the hospital for a(nother) attempt at my life, I was surrounded by family and friends who want to support me.

I am a 26 year old female that has had depression since i could remember i started cutting myself in high school and stopped when i graduated with very few relapses but for the past year i have been wanting to i just recently had a son who is my pride and joy but my son is the only thing that i have in my life. his father is not around and everything in my life just seems to be getting worse. i constantly stare at the razor in my hand and just want to release all this pain and sorrow and loneliness that i feel but i cannot bring the razor down because i can only think what my one year old son would think if he knew what i wanted to do i just need to know another way to release the pain cause i can not figure anything out i know how cutting makes me feel released but i know that i cannot do it anymore. help me,-
"Feeling numb I have realized that if I cannot talk to someone about my feelings then the next best thing is to write them down and seek advice from reddit so here I am. I am on campus right now preparing for my midterm and my confidence is at an all time low. I have not even seen the paper and already I feel as if I have lost. I never thought I would reach such a low in my life. Something weird happened today. I finally set up a countdown timer to the day my exam results are announced. That seemed like the next logical step and it made complete sense to me in a weird way. The only thing that made me remove that was talking to my parents and seeing the hope and love for me in their eyes. I know my life is not truly mine and that if I hurt myself then I also hurt other people but it is just getting too much. The thought is always there in my mind and for the past few days that voice has gotten stronger. I have been through this period before and had come out nearly unharmed and at the beginning of the year I was feeling optimistic about what is to come but that lasted all of one month. The future I was dreaming of looks bleak and distant and with every passing minute that future keeps on going farther and farther away from me. I try very hard to keep my guard up near people I know and love but it is becoming harder and harder to do so. I used to think that I was destined to do some good in the world but maybe that was just me being delusional. It is getting harder to keep the tears in. Whenever I used to feel numb, I used to punch the wall just to feel something but even that is not helping now. All I wanna do is talk to someone and pour my heart out but I do not know if I have the strength left to do that. Getting out of bed is starting to feel like a struggle and for the first time in a while I am afraid of myself, of what I might do if things do not go my way. I know that this is not the end of the line but why does it feel like it is? How can anyone recover from such a failure? It is gotten so bad that I would much rather prefer that I disappeared than having to tell my parents what is wrong. Depression is nothing new for my university and it would not be the first time that someone took a drastic step and now I know why they did what they did. The pressure and stress which comes with a university as respected as mine, is just too much to handle. I am almost inclined to reveal my university is name just in case someone is able to figure out who I am and I can finally get the respite I desire so much. All around me I see happy faces and I can only hope that one day I can leave all this behind me and be happy but in the meantime I guess I just have to struggle on and wait for the light at the end of the tunnel.","Feeling numb I have realized that if I cannot talk to someone about my feelings then the next best thing is to write them down and seek advice from reddit so here I am.

i am not really sure what i want to say here. I was sexually abused by my brother from the age of 4 until i was about 17. He hung himself when i was 20. i am 34 now and just finding it hard to get a handle on life. I never really thought of what happened to me as being a big deal but my partner has made me think again about what happened in the past. my most formative years were disrupted and i believe i am still suffering as a result. I suppose i am just wondering if anyone has any advice or knows of anyone who was in a similar situation. I am in counseling at the moment and am just starting to face my demons. I came off my depression / anxiety medications. i felt they were stopping me from really feeling and i felt i needed to be fully aware of my feeling in order to work through this and be able to let go. at the moment i do not see an end to all this.,"I am in counseling at the moment and am just starting to face my demons.

"Browsing r/nostalgia was a mistake Looking through that sub just makes me cry. It reminds me of how quickly time passes, and how I feel like I never utilized my childhood years to create lasting memories. I was just a passive observer, always waiting for my happiness to arrive. It never did.",-
"I am starting to feel really frustrated with life because there are things I do not understand about the world. My problem is I think too much and I wish I was off in space thinking about a night out in the city but I am not. Instead I focus on every negative thing I can. I would never kill myself and because I would not do that I really want to know how I can get over all this shit and be happy with what I got. I do not know if it is my mind playing the victim but I feel like everyone close to me is out to hurt me. For example I am 20 and I do not have a car. I can understand I should already have it like two years ago but this a prime point for my parents to pick on me. For some reason my mom got herself into a bit of a mood and started having a go at me which caused me to end up in tears because she told me I am hopeless and so are all my brothers and that I am an embarrassment. This is all because I do not have a car! She is usually really caring but she came out with all this stuff. Am I going crazy or is it really a huge deal to not yet have a car? Is it worth hurting your daughter over?? Then there is my supposed ""boyfriend"" who picks on me about my weight. I am not as thin as I once was. I have put on about 10 kilos in 3 years. I know it is not a good thing but for ages everything was about my weight. I used to weigh 54 kg which is tiny and now I am 64kg. My boyfriend is at university and thinks that my life holds no meaning because I apparently have no hobbies and I just turn up to my ""little job"". I have friends that are completely selfish and I always end up paying for everything and they cannot even do me a simple favor. I do not want to play the victim because I have been a punching bag for so many people who themselves have played the victim so it is nothing I would aspire to be. I could write pages and pages and pages of how annoyed I am but I thought I would just give an idea. I am sick of people being the way they are to me and making me out to be a energy drain. Does anyone know what to do to not feel bad about who you are?","I am starting to feel really frustrated with life because there are things I do not understand about the world.

"Trying to understand my depressed SO I am sorry if I am posting in the wrong sub. I just figured you guys could offer perspective So my SO is away for work (for more than a month), but we are still in the same time zone. Lately, he is been having bad episodes, but a week ago he said he had a really session with his therapist there. (I am proud to say that he said I was the only person who managed to convince him to seek professional help!) So, okay, so far so good. When he has bad days, sometimes he likes to ""check out of the world"". He also feels that opening up about his struggles might be too much of a burden for me. But we had a discussion before wherein I said, I understand that you might need space, but let me know if you are having a bad day, and you are not in a chatty mood. Not sure if this was the right approach, but this was the time before the therapist and after we learned that he had to be away for more than a month. And for the most part, he is been open with me. This weekend really bothered me because it was radio silence, despite my check ins, and despite not asking ""how are you questions"". For example, we are both big football/soccer fans so I tried to talk about the World Cup. He is a huge fan of the French team which won the Cup. Nothing. My anxious nature is making things more challenging because now I am thinking is it the depression or relationship issues? My anxious self might pester him for answers but I am not sure if that is helpful. So, I am not sure how to go about this. Let him be and try not to freak out until he returns? Advice greatly appreciated. Thanks","When he has bad days, sometimes he likes to ""check out of the world"".

"I cannot stop thinking about suicide and it is making it hard to do anything I cant get these thoughts of suicide out of my head. The word just keeps popping up in my head. I keep thinking of where I could go, or what effect it would have. I cannot get it out of my head. I have been staring at reddit doing absolutely nothing because every time i do something it keeps coming up again and it just distracts me until im slumped in my chair staring or lying on the ground. I used to smoke weed all the time, I like to think it helped me ignore my depression, but it really just made my depression make me more useless than i already am. I do not see the any sort of happy ending to my life. The happiest i can see myself attain is dying alone with a self-published book thats gone unread till I die, then maybe someone will read it. I dont see myself ever finding love, I see friends leaving every minute, every conversation I have with family only makes them hate me more. I try so hard everyday. I feel like im the only one trying. I adapt to my friends, they never pay me mind. I adapt to my family, they dont pay me mind. Its easier staying in my room all day.

"During my high school years I was always a little ""klooster"" never went out that much never did anything bad .. When I left school I moved to Johannesburg and from there moved to my mom in Mpumalanga, South Africa, a day before my 21st birthday I got raped .. the most terrible feeling ever, I was not wearing any revealing clothes, had jeans a t-shirt and tekkies on, how do you explain this. I always believed that those girls, wearing the most revealing clothes are the ones that ask for it, but do they really? I can not see how any one can ask for this, it is the worst thing that can ever happen to you. A few months thereafter I had to have an abortion due to the fact that I could not keep the baby .. I was way too young, I never and still up until date, do not believe in this type thing, but now I think? Was it the right thing to do, will you ever be able to face the child the same way you will face a child born into a happy and wonderful marriage? I also suffer from depression, high blood pressure and all those wonderful things, I got married in December 2005 and due to me and my fiance having a big argument with my dad, he never walked me down the aisle on my big day and me and my husband had to pay for the whole wedding, I feel awful, but the things my dad said and done can never be forgiven. My stepsister had a baby at the end of December and she is getting married now in April 2006, guess who is doing and paying for her wedding .. I feel sick, sick of people always walking over me, always stuffing it in my face and my frustration gets taken out on the wrong people, my husband is the one getting it? I battle to have healthy sex, due to the fact that every time I close my eyes, I see this person on top of me, forcing himself in, I feel guilty to have kids, how can I have more, if I killed one? How can I bring up a family if my own family is up to shit .. I often find myself wondering why? Why me, why am I the one crying myself to sleep, why do I have to keep myself in tone, to prevent a stroke, especially at my young age??","I was way too young, I never and still up until date, do not believe in this type thing, but now I think?

"Reminder that it will get better. Everyday I get home from my part time job, I cry for at least half an hour before I get up to go inside and finish the rest of my day. Everyday I feel and believe that things just keep getting heavier to deal with. That my life will not become healthier and I will not ever be happy. It is one issues after the next, or all at once and I keep wanting (sometimes do) push it off to the side. Everyday I also remind myself that it will get better. Sitting here alone, sobbing my eyes out while texting this post, I do not believe it in these moments, but I am not giving myself any other choice/exception. I will beat this and be happy.

"Well I am new here so here goes nothing. I have been diagnosed clinically depressed, along with obsessive compulsive disorder. I am 32 years old. I have been divorced once and have since re - married. I have 2 children, 7 year old boy (stepson) and 4 1/2 year old girl. I work for a state government agency repairing computers. So far so good right? Well the major problems I am having is becoming a social recluse. I have a REALLY hard time ""letting things go"". In 2005, I lost both my sister (suicide) and my father (heart attack), and those events only added to the trauma I would been going through. I live in a small town, so when I went to the doctor about possible ADHD (i was moody, could not focus on work, could not complete tasks on time etc), they determined I was bipolar and put me on Effexor and Wellbutrin. Well that just did absolutely nothing. In fact my anger with the world increased dramatically and I had rage episodes that about destroyed my second marriage. I have had a lot of rage in the past. Recently I have not had any outbursts. I am currently taking Cymbalta and Celexa and that seems to be a good combination. But I still have a hard time going to work, and functioning throughout the day. I would rather stay at home, in my bedroom, away from people most of the time. That is what bothers me. I am on antidepressants, but it does not seem to help me get motivated to face the world. Does that come from within? Is there no magic pill that will all of a sudden make me feel confident? I guess that is good enough for now. I have a ton of mental history but do not want to flood anybody.","I am 32 years old.

"Hi, sorry if this turns into a lengthy post, but I could do with some advice, and I think this is probably the best place to ask. Firstly, I should point out, I am a 19 year male. My problem is that I am concerned by the physical effects the depression is having on me. I have probably been suffering from depression for several years, but I only sought medical help last November after I had a breakdown. The doctor has prescribed me with Fluoxetine, and I am taking 40mg per day. I originally started off on 20mg per day, but after I told the doctor what I will tell you now, about 2 months ago, he ""upgraded"" my status to severe depression, hence the increase in dosage. I can appreciate that my mindset is slightly biased towards feeling negative, and expecting the worst, but nevertheless I cannot help but feel my symptoms might be the result of an even more serious problem. The medication has helped my mind (even though I still have plenty of lows, they are not always as severe as they were 6 months ago), yet my physical health is deteriorating to the point where that is the main factor preventing me from accomplishing day to day tasks. My symptoms are as follows (and they may be generalized, I will admit): Constant fatigue, even after plenty of rest; constant aching throughout the body; generally feeling very weak, lacking energy and strength, e.g. carrying shopping home can leave my arms in agony; loss of coordination, I have become very clumsy, always knocking glasses over, or dropping things for no reason; occasional loss of balance, usually when getting up, or starting to walk from a stand still; joints are feeling slightly stiff, they still move, but I can feel more resistance than normal and they get very tired very quick if was to use them, or even just hold my arms straight out in front of me; and for me, the worst symptom is an almost constant tremor in both hands and arms, which sometimes spreads throughout the body. If I attempt slow, fine movements with my hands, the tremor becomes very clear and results in jerky movements. Also, I like to exercise, yet after all exercises, even low intensity ones, the trembling seems to intensify. I doubt it is anxiety, as I still shake when I am calm, relaxed and immobile. I know I cannot expect I diagnosis, but I would appreciate it if anyone can tell me if the severity of the physical effects I am experiencing, is quite common, even when the mental state is much more relaxed and beginning to recover? Thanks for any help","I originally started off on 20mg per day, but after I told the doctor what I will tell you now, about 2 months ago, he ""upgraded"" my status to severe depression, hence the increase in dosage.

"I see no way out, except to stop this life. I am 59 years old and have not worked since 2004 due to depression and anxiety disorders. I live on social security disability. I barely have enough money to live on. I lost all my savings after losing my job as a teacher. I did make my car payment, but I could not pay my other bills. I have about $14,00 in debts now. I have not been able to work due to depression and panic attacks. I should try to work, but my teaching credential has expired.

"Is anyone taking Lamictal? After trying almost every available antidepressant through the years, my psychiatrist is having me try Lamictal.

"Hello, my name is Joe and I have been battling some form of depression, but I do not know what type or how severe it is. I have a family history of bipolar depression but I am not sure if this is a disease that is genetic to such an extent. Does it skip generations? My moods swing from euphoria to deep depression to where I contemplate just cutting away from my life and vanish. I am not suicidal; just feel at times isolation is the answer. I have one trigger I know of and it is usually when I am lacking in knowledge of a current situation I may be in. This make sense?

This will then lead to insomnia and I will once again, for the second night in a row, be up all night working and mind wandering contemplating just getting in my car and driving to a remote town and re-invent myself. I have tried professional help, but to no avail I am just as bad if not worse. I figured since I am online most the day I would search for a forum that might lead me on a better path.

"I think for me some of the major issues affecting my depression are happiness, motivation and isolation..I am not really sure which came first, but I voted motivation, as I do not seem to have any! I cannot remember the last time I truly felt 'happy' either - I think it was probably about 5 or 6 years ago when I was in college, had a great social life and thought I was with a great guy cially, I find it very difficult to stay in touch with people because I am paranoid that they do not really want to hear from me. I lost touch with friends when I moved to college, and then lost friends when I moved back to my home town. Now I have very few friends, and feel the ones I do have do not really care too much about me. I hate sounding like I am feeling sorry for myself, but it is hard to explain..","I cannot remember the last time I truly felt 'happy' either - I think it was probably about 5 or 6 years ago when I was in college, had a great social life and thought I was with a great guy cially, I find it very difficult to stay in touch with people because I am paranoid that they do not really want to hear from me."
"I am a guy..well still a teen but a guy, and the sad thing is I feel such like a girl. I am not into the macho thing, but I cry all the time when I am not around people, I feel like crap, I have swings where all of a sudden I just get very very angry at people All these things. I have never gone to a doctor out of fear of embarrassment and telling my parents what I feel. I hide it from them and try to hide it from others..but it usually does not work. Its been like this for a year now, but as of late it does not end, before there was some couple of day breaks in between, but now everyday I am depressed. I am sick of life..I want to end it, but the only thing that is stopping me is what happens if I do. I just cannot get pass the action..what happens during it. There is almost a physical feeling surrounding me..I feel it. That is just how I feel. Hope that gives insight. Maybe it is the man in me to scared to go to a doctor.","I am a guy..well still a teen but a guy, and the sad thing is I feel such like a girl.

"Lately i have been having some very vivid story - like dreams, normally i cannot follow my dreams because they switch too quickly. i had a dream where i took my grandmother is large knife and a permanent marker and wrote my signature on it. Then later my mother found out about what i had done and became so angry with what i had done, that she made me cry, and i actually woke up crying. Then later that day i took a nap and i dreamt that i was being seduced by Tom Cruise, (who had gained a lot of weight), and when things began to heat up i rejected him, and he became very angry at me. He then later came to the house where i was, and began trying to hurt me and the people around me (which was an older lady, a young boy and teenage girl). i could hear him saying ""just kill them"" and talking about how he was really embarrassed when i rejected him, and he could do so much better than me. i then proceeded to take the young boy into hiding, and while hiding we were found and the boy hurt Tom defensively, but in a very graphic manor. I cannot understand why i am having such negative dreams, why they are so vivid, and what they all mean!","Then later that day i took a nap and i dreamt that i was being seduced by Tom Cruise, (who had gained a lot of weight), and when things began to heat up i rejected him, and he became very angry at me."
I am 16 years old. I am having problems in school and I feel like dropping out. I also feel like committing suicide. I have foster parents and I do not like them one bit. I cry every night because I miss my mom. At this point in life I do not feel a need in living. I really need your help and advice to make me feel more comfortable talking to my foster parents and to convince me not to kill myself. I am a very suicidal person who is looking for help. I have a record of cutting myself and burning myself so i think that the cutting and burning led to suicidal attempts I am looking for help. i do not know what led suicide but if anyone has any advice on what i could do or any questions please tell me,"I also feel like committing suicide.

"The Last of Us I just finished my second playthrough, PS3 (im poor, sue me bitch). after the part with the cannibals, ellie sat on a bench and did not talk much. this, in combination with when she says ""he tried to.."" to joel after she kills david, made me get a bit angry and sad. then i thought about my female friends (few as they may be) and family and how if any ever hurt them in such a way, especially my family, well i think it is better if that is left unsaid. had to pause the game for a min to cry. i never thought i would be so depressed that a video game could make me cry (and i have played a lot of games, over 1,200 trophies on PSN. only this one made me cry). and in retrospect, i now think i have come to appreciate at least one aspect of my depression: emotion and the appreciation of it. sometimes i can look at someone, there body language, listen to them and feel there pain, suffering and sadness. i now appreciate The Last of Us, life and other people more. although i did feel more alone afterwards (especially since i think it would be wonderful to find a girl that has a personality like ellie is. never had a gf, had any physical romantic interaction with a girl or even been on a date. i was 12 when the game was released and will probably still be 16 when part 2 comes out, so we ai not dealin with no pedo shit in these christian suburbs) it was definitely worth it. -just thought i would share that in the hopes that it would brighten someone is day. I love you all, stay safe.","and in retrospect, i now think i have come to appreciate at least one aspect of my depression: emotion and the appreciation of it.

"I have been abandoned by anyone I have ever loved. My mother emptied the bank accounts and left while I was in school one day, 20 years ago. A few years later, my father followed suit, getting sent to prison and never contacting me again. My brother lives across the country, have not spoken to him in years. Sister actually lives a few miles away, have not spoken to her in months. And recently my girlfriend of 4 years, who I was planning on proposing to, left without any warning, not even a talk. I have not spoken out loud to another human, barring work hours, in 3 weeks. I received my last non work related text 2 weeks ago. I keep trying to keep going, but I want to give up. I want to feel nothing. I do not want to cry anymore. And if I did, gave up, did the unthinkable, no one would know for months.","My brother lives across the country, have not spoken to him in years.

I Just Found Out I am a Toxic Person I manipulate people I ruin all my relationships I do not want to get help or change I have problems I shove said problems onto other people I cause other people to be angry I am extremely critical of everything and everyone I blame others for my problems I hate myself Thanks for reading,-
"(I am 39) I say this to myself all the time, SJW..I never thought I would be in this position..but I am..and so are you..I can relate to you on many levels. If I did not work for my father I am sure I would be unemployed..due to my concentration problems, ATTENDANCE problems, uneven mood and unpredictable production level..so I am very lucky. I can see what challenges you face. I often thought that I might like to go into some sort of counseling because of my life experiences also. Do you live in a big enough city that you can apply at some mental health clinics or government aid departments? Sometimes the willingness to do that kind of work can get you in the door. It may be entry level, but you could work up if it were a job that satisfied your needs. What about like an activity director at a youth home, or a retirement village/senior home, or a special needs program? Here our recreation commission has a special populations program that coordinates trips and activities for the special population of the area. They go on ski trips and day trips and it looks very fun! Of course it takes a certain frame of mind to be able to work with the special population of the world. But I just mention it because you talked about counseling.. I just wanted to clarify that although I am very lucky to have an income, it really fuels my depression sometimes to think about ""how I am letting my dad down"" or causing him extra crap to deal with..so lucky and not so lucky.","If I did not work for my father I am sure I would be unemployed..due to my concentration problems, ATTENDANCE problems, uneven mood and unpredictable production level..so I am very lucky.

"When people with good intentions say the wrong shit.. How do you deal with it? When someone who is just trying to help you says something that cuts you really deeply, or when they are pushing you when you just need them to back off while. How do you personally deal with it? Recently I had an Uncle who I was close with get involved trying to help with my depression and anxiety issues. He encouraged me to go see a therapist again for the first time in years and was just there to talk and encourage. Then when he saw progress he started pushing more and more and I started getting really stressed. Then when I had a break down and started slipping back he took said some shit to me which really cut me deep. I stopped talking to him for a while after that. He said things that confirmed what I thought people in my family were thinking abou me. Now the issue I am facing. I do not feel justified in being angry at him because he was trying to help and he just got too excited at seeing progress that I had made many times before and then he got frustrated when it came to a halt. So now I just feel guilty at having the feelings and the anger turns inward and eats me up. But the anger and hurt do not go away from what he said either. It is been months and I just do not want to talk to or see him at all. He is reaching out again and I cannot find the words to explain the anger and hurt I feel, because I feel like I should not be angry or hurt. So it is just a big spiral of anger and shame. The worst part is I do not know of I can ever have the same relationship I had with him before. We were buddies. Even if I get over this I just do not know if the trust will ever be back. This makes me sad. I did not really want him involved, but good intentions make it hard to tell people their help is not wanted.","When someone who is just trying to help you says something that cuts you really deeply, or when they are pushing you when you just need them to back off while.

"Dear reddit, happiness is not a choice for everyone I am sorry but I need to get this off my chest in a place where people will understand me. Dear people that think happiness is a choice, it is not. Me or my fellow sufferers do not choose to be miserable. In fact if it really was that simple, I am sure 99% of us would choose to be happy without even having to think. I feel sad because I have mental illness. If you do not know, that means my brain is not normal. My brain has deficiencies and such that keep me from feeling happy, even when I should. I am so sick of reading replies to mine and other people is post about depression that try to oversimplify a serious mental illness that can cause suicide. I swear everyone on this website assumes we do nothing to try to help ourselves. I really cannot believe people are that misinformed that they really think that many people choose to be that miserable. You would not choose to be miserable if you had the choice, and so would we. But we do not get that choice. Then we have comments like ""Just put a life together that wont make you depressed"". I think these piss me off the most. If it was really that simple you think I would of done that by now? Also a lot of people do not mention how hard changing your life can be if you do not have money or resources.

"I went on 6weeks. FMLA almost two years ago for depression, GAD and Panic Disorder. I felt uncomfortable when I went back, after having had the same position for 25 yrs, but I am still there, and no one made a big deal about it when I came back. I am still on medicines for depression and have a ton of anxiety, which the medicines help with. I am able to function in a fast paced environment where things change every day. I can sleep, which is great as I put off going in for treatment and was beat when I finally got on medicines, had lost weight, and was headed for agoraphobia. Medicines and some therapy work well for me. I cannot deny that I had myself under one ton of stress and had no outlets. I found out the hard way that there is more to life than work, work, work. One has to find a way to relax, too.","I went on 6weeks.

"I have completed step one I am killing myself this year. Not sure when, but I am really hoping I can make it happen. Last week, I had a wild night in the shower with a lot of vodka and a razor, posted one last snap on my story with a waving emoji, then went full white noise. No snapchat, no instagram, no Facebook, nothing. Broke all my streaks. Now I have no contact with anyone at all. I avoid the people I know at meal times. I stay in my room and game, or start the long list of letters I have to write to people. The sad thing is, I could have been dead almost a week and no one would know. No one has come to my room to check on me, or message me to ask if I am ok. No ones seen or heard from me in days. I have pushed everyone away.

"I owe 31k in student loans, my mom owes 52k in PLUS loans on my education. I feel so terrible.. I am the first of my 3 siblings to go to college. I got depressed and wasted a year. Now I am on my 5th year and I will not graduate till one more semester in the fall. I have been working too but I only make enough to cover some of my living expenses. My school schedule only lets me work around 30 hours a week. My mom has helped me out by taking out Parent PLUS loans for me which she is responsible to repay after I graduate. So far she owes $52k while I owe $31k. I feel so shitty, I cannot believe Ive put her through all of this. My dad does not work so it is just her, and my siblings have yet to finish college (one of them is starting in a couple years). I am so pissed off at myself, how did I let this happen? If I had my act together I could have graduated earlier. I hate myself so much for this, I always prided myself on keeping my mom from harm but she is going to be in so much debt. It is so unfair, if I had thought this through maybe she would not be in this position. Im so close to graduation but so fucking scared. What if I do not get a job right away?

"Helping a girlfriend with depression possibly? Hello, I want to first off say this is a throwaway. I also looked for similar post regarding what I will ask, but i really want a tailored answer for my own sanity. Sorry for being selfish, this is just hard. I have been dating this girl for almost a year and I know she has been slipping into an abyss of what I cannot diagnose, but seems like depression. I will start with a time table. We began dating after meeting on a popular dating app and we hit it off fast. Similar interest, goals, outlooks, expectations, and lifestyle. We became extremely close with in two months and then out of the blue she tells me its over. I did not feel it was a justifiable way to end the relationship. I contacted her and we had long winded email correspondence with in which she had this quote to me "" I feel lost at work, lost in my personal life, and just lost with trying to find my happiness. You do make me happier. And idk what just snapped last week but I was super depressed all week ."" I talked with her and we set small goals to rekindle and help her find her happiness. We got back together with in two weeks and that started a prolonged honeymoon period for which we traveled, went on ski trips, took our dogs on hikes, and generally enjoyed ourselves. This continued until march or 2018, when I noticed her slipping back in to her just overall never satisfied state. I got worried and tried to lightly push her to no avail. I then tried to make plans at least twice a month to help distract her and give her a solid thing to look forward to. She never changed and just got worse to the point where the last 2 months, she gets home from work smokes enough weed to put me to sleep, eats too much and then goes to sleep by 9. I tried to encourage by proxy by going to the gym and going to parks with her dog and taking pictures and even getting closer with her family. nothing worked. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, she went to Sweden on a vacation with her best friend and had a blast and was calling me everyday so happy and excited. I thought we had a legitimate break through. Then one week before she returns i start to only get 1 or 2 text a day, I figure she is living her best life to busy with international travel to communicate regularly like she requested. She returns and we spend one night together and she calls me at school to come over to her place asap. she dumps me with little to no explanation. I met with her once more to voice my opinion and she was just quiet and had nothing to say but sorry and that i deserve someone who loves me like Love her. Today she starts emailing me about how she just needs space and she wants me to still talk to her family. I really do not know what to think.. My friends say fuck her move on. I have never had a connection or love for someone outside my family and I have had at least 3 relationships over 2 years (I am almost 30). This one really felt different, the way she looked in my eyes and the way we talked about all our joint desires, just felt so good. I just want everyone to know I am open to honest responses and please feel free to speak openly, I just hurt because I feel like this is when she needs me most, but also might just need her own time to figure her self out. Thank you for your time and help.

"Feel like I have no right to feel this way People have it worse than me, while I, a privileged man with a loving family, cannot feel most of the time. I hate using the term depressed. Even as I am writing this, I feel like I want to delete it. It is being thrown around so much lately that I feel like I am just being a little bitch that uses it like I do not know it. Have been seeing therapists for months, talking to them and trying to find a way on how to see life differently. Thankfully I am not prescribed any of those fucking pills, because my current therapist is smart enough to know they are not the best medicine for me.

"Hey, My name is Jonathan. I am 23 years old. I am a senior in college hoping to be through very VERY soon. I went through a really rough depression era starting around the age of 15 and lasting till I was 21. It started to get a little better when I got into college, but then severely accelerated throughout the years. I took a year off from school to work and basically to get help, which I did. I found out a lot of my depression was cognitive.. thinking negatively about myself. When I was growing up, I was a real shy guy. I think some of that though has turned into a social anxiety issue, but I did not have a great social. I still do not, but once I got help, the psychologist I saw really helped me get past the negative thinking, but I still have really tightly bound emotional issues from time to time that tend to really upset me. It is taken pieces of my personality and completely do a 180. Part of my depression was that I was co-dependent. Now I am really completely independent. I guess I am trying more to understand than to get just advice. I cannot make sense of my emotions anymore.","It started to get a little better when I got into college, but then severely accelerated throughout the years.

"The only thing that can happen in such a boring world is terror. Or something. Did you se the footage from Monrovia (that is in Liberia, for any Americans who might be reading this..)? I cannot understand how these kids are just walking around firing their AKs as if they are hanging out after school. You do not tend to see the other side but I assume it is the same. There was a shot of a group of kids nonchalantly lounging around on the back of a pickup truck upon which was mounted an old-fashioned looking heavy machine-gun, the kind with an armored shield and mounted on a pivot, maybe a mobile anti-aircraft gun. The truck was not moving, the gun was in use. So why were a bunch of kids just sitting there? Do not human beings usually seek to protect themselves from danger? Why do people involved in a fire fight walk around as if they were popping out to the shops for a six pack and a box of 200 B & H?

What do you do when everything you were told turned out to be bullshit and you realize that everyone you know is deluded?

Or something. I have lashed out at her, hitting and screaming and have, during intense screaming matches, to beat my fists against the wall. This is the best I can do to prevent myself from smashing her to pieces. My right hand still hurts me from a couple of days ago. She closes the windows to try to spare the neighbors any unpleasantness. God knows what they must think. Like I could give a fuck. I am inconsiderate, I am selfish, I am a bastard, I have a cold attitude to others, I am a snob, I have contempt for everyone. I do not know which is my stuff and which is hers. I am thinking more of suicide these days. I used to have the regular teenage fascination with my mortality and the potential termination thereof. We were going to try for a baby but she has a hormonal condition which seems quite serious. I have to go wank in a jar and see if my tadpoles are doing whatever it is they should do. She wants me to consider going off with another woman to procreate if it turns out she is infertile. This fills me with rage. I will not tell you why. If you do not understand this you do not understand. What does anyone understand? Is life ever going to change? I am starting to suffer from a new sort of depression.

"I am 15 and have been depressed for about a year. i got over it for a little while but now i am back to all the pain. I cut myself for the first time a couple weeks ago and now i cannot stop. I always reach for my knife when I am alone and hurting. One of my major problems is that I am really good at hiding my feelings. No one knows that I am depressed and no one except my best friend knew that i cut myself. I told my best friend because we tell each other everything when I told her the only thing she could say was ""you are Crazy"" Not exactly the reaction i was expecting especially since she once told me that she cut herself because we got into a huge fight. And even though I knew she was only saying it for attention and she had no scars on her wrist the next day, i still supported her. But now she is turning her back on me. I think she thinks I am doing it for attention but I am not. if i were i would not hide the scars under my wrist band and long sleeve shirts. Any way so now i have no one there to talk to. I do not trust anyone anymore and I am too scared to tell my parents. Even if i did they cannot do anything. I have 3 other brothers and my parents do not have the time or money to deal with my problems. I really scare myself. I have already planned out how I am going to kill myself if i do and i tempt myself all the time i never have the guts to go through with it all the way but I still try.

"Feeling good about helping people Does anyone else here ever feel better about themselves when you are able to offer a little help or guidance to someone off the street you do not know? As an example, sometime last month I was having a pretty meh day, just.. Not feeling the worst ever, but not feeling very good either, when on my way home I happened to find an iPhone sitting on a grate outside the subway station. I picked it up and looked around for the owner, then after entering the station found a couple of young women searching their bags and I asked if the phone was theirs. It was, and they said ""thank you so much!"" And I felt really happy that I would been able to help them, like, I just kinda decided right then to forget about my problems, because, I would helped someone. Like, maybe those two would have never found their phone if I had not come along. I mean they probably would have, but, y'know. I felt like I would been helpful in a real small but meaningful way and that felt good. I really like helping people, but I usually get upset when I try to help people I actually know personally, because, well, people do not always want help with more personal issues, or even with simple issues from people they know well, and trying to tell when to help or not is just really complicated. Like, I will just real nicely try to suggest a solution to a problem, or simply offering some consolation, and instead of, I dunno, actually trying it or telling me patiently why that is not a good idea, they just rail on me and tell me to shut up or whatever. And I just feel like, jeez, what would I do? I am trying to help here.. And I always get real upset about that and doubt myself over it, like, am I doing a bad thing by trying to be nice? I know that is not true, I get sometimes people want to figure things out on their own, or I guess you do not like my attitude or blablabla, but, I dunno, you cannot maybe acknowledge that I am trying to do good? But in a situation where it is just strangers, trying to find their way, cross the street, lost a thing or whatever, it is easy to tell when they need help, because everything is a lot more straightforward, if that makes sense. If someone needs help, it is usually pretty obvious and they are almost always pretty receptive to help, and, provided you just look like a normal person, they do not judge. No biases or baggage over past interactions or whatever, they are just happy to have help. So yeah I guess this is a little longer than it needs to be, but, yeah. Helping random people feels good and distracts from my depression a little. Is what I was saying. Anyone else feel this way?","Feeling good about helping people Does anyone else here ever feel better about themselves when you are able to offer a little help or guidance to someone off the street you do not know?

"Every Day is Exactly the Same. I am Lonely, Worthless, and Done With Life Every day, I wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep. That is basically it. That is my life.

I had no idea that she felt the way she did, and she would not even discuss the matter with me. I have tried meeting other people since then, and I have gone on exactly three dates with one person. That is it. I am basically invisible to women, and no amount of effort will ever change that. I just have to accept the reality that I hold absolutely no value in a romantic context. Why? I do not know. Maybe it is because my generation is only interested in people who are aesthetically in the top tier, or make the most money. Maybe it is because my generation is eschewing committed relationships in favor of having fuck buddies left and right, whoring themselves out to whoever will get their rocks off, both men and women are at fault for this. I do not think I am a particularly unattractive guy, and I make a pretty damn good amount of money for my age, but since I am not in that top 10% of men, I am just always going to be passed over and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. It is almost like there something inherent to my existence that prevents me from having any intimacy. No matter how much money I make or how much I improve myself, that intrinsic quality of my being will always hold me back. I did not ask for this, but it is the way things are, so I have pretty much given up completely. I do not have any plans of offing myself or anything like that. But every day, it gets harder and harder to convince myself that I actually have anything worth living for. The one thought I keep coming back to is how scared my cat would be if I gave her to a shelter or how she would get by if I were gone. I love my cat, and she does not deserve to be put in a situation like that. I feel like she is the only thing keeping me marginally together. The thought of causing her any distress breaks my heart, and one of the big things on my mind all the time is simply making sure she is happy and feels safe. I feel worthless and frustrated. I wish I understood how to achieve what I want in life and be happy, but I guess that is just not in the cards. I cannot wait until the day I die, I will finally get some goddamn peace and quiet. I am so tired of feeling broken. I am so tired of constantly being reminded that there is something wrong with me, like I am some sort of bastard aberration of what humans are supposed to be. I have struggled with this for 12 years now. I do not know how much more I can take.","I am Lonely, Worthless, and Done With Life Every day, I wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep.

"Today just sucks I have been sitting at my desk at work for the past hour and a half crying on and off. Not really sure why. I feel physically sick and I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and sleep for a few days. I am supposed to teach a class tonight, but I am really not sure I can function around people. I know I should just cancel it, but I feel guilty doing that, and I have no idea why. It makes no sense since I cannot seem to bring myself to care about anything else right now- like the fact that I have gotten almost nothing done at work today and probably will not in the remaining 3 hours. I just do not know what to do anymore.",Today just sucks I have been sitting at my desk at work for the past hour and a half crying on and off.
"Painfully lonely and spiraling into the worst depression I have ever been in I recently moved to a new city for a job after college. I have a few friends at work, but they are a group of guys that I do not have a lot in common with and we do not really talk outside of the occasional work conversation. They are nice and I am happy to be friends with them, but it is hard for me to really get to know them because they do ""guy stuff"" on the weekends (like sitting around drinking and playing FIFA) that I am totally not interested in/they do not bother inviting me to. Other than that, I have a few online friends that I am growing increasingly dependent on for social interaction which is really unhealthy. I notice myself getting more paranoid with them about not responding, and I bug them way too much to the point where I know I would definitely be annoyed if I was them. Also they are not very supportive (probably the opposite) but it is not their fault -- they are just causal online friends that should not have to cater to my current host of mental problems. I am totally alone. My family and college friends live 4 hours away. I have pretty bad social anxiety and I am terrified of every new social interaction I have. I work 9 hours and come home to my empty apartment and watch netflix to escape my own life, every day. I sometimes hear from my college friends about all of the fun they are still having together and it honestly brings me to tears that I have such a pathetic lonely life now. I have never been able to have a ""normal"" social life -- it takes me forever to make close friends, and then even at my best I only have a handful of good friends at a time. I do not enjoy going out every weekend or the other obvious ways of making friends, and that would not work now anyway since I would NEVER go alone and I do not have a single person that I could ask to go with me. When I was a freshman in college I had this same problem -- absolutely zero friends and living in a totally different city. It was the worst depression I have ever been through. I had dozens and dozens of online friends at the time (now we have all lost touch and moved on from the RPG we were playing) that helped ease the loneliness, and I eventually joined a student club and finally made friends after like a year of going. There is not really anything I can ""join"" like that in a non-college town.. I have been applying for a few volunteering things, they have not started but I am doubtful that it will be a good way to meet people. I honestly just need ONE person to talk to. Anyone. I do not know what is wrong with me, I am not a complete weirdo or anything and I know I can have meaningful friendships (just 90% of them have been online, and now I cannot even seem to make any fucking online friends either), but I live the loneliest life of anyone I have ever known or heard of. I have never been serious about suicide, but recently that is changed and it is becoming something I could actually picture myself doing. I am a long way from that but at this point I do not see anything getting better and I practically cry myself to sleep some days and have to hide emotional breakdowns at work after eating lunch alone. Does anyone have any advice for meeting new people in a non-college town? Anyone else having the same problem? I am so lost and sad and pathetic","My family and college friends live 4 hours away.

"I am an empty shell of a person I only show emotion I do not feel it when society dictates that I should laugh or cry I do but I do not feel happy or sad just nothing.

"I feel like I am spiraling downwards. I am losing people and cannot do anything about it or do the wrong things. I am just searching desperately for someone to care before it is too late. This summer has just flown by. I work so much and made the mistake of taking multiple summer classes. I spend every moment I can trying to do fun things with my friends but many times it is not as much as I would like. My best friend is stationed overseas, and while I have a close group of friends I have known for years, literally all of them are doing something this fall that takes them elsewhere. When they are gone, I am going to be all by myself. I have been so lonely lately too. Just wanting someone to care about me. I had it and fucked it all up at the beginning of the year, and I just regret it all the time. I drink by myself a lot at night to deal with the loneliness, but it makes it worse. This summer has already just been shitty, but at least my friends are around. It is like fall is just a ticking time bomb at this point. No matter how hard I try to talk to someone new it never goes my way and I am always left on read or stood up on plans. The other night, I got drunk and did something I have never done before, and that was cut myself. Honestly, I feel like I did it to see if I could, and how it would make me feel. I guess I still do not know how it does, but I was disappointed in myself I let it get so far. I do not know. I just feel like this year has just been me slowly losing the only things that make me happy.","I am just searching desperately for someone to care before it is too late.

Need some advice Should I try to fit in by pretending to be cheerful all the time or should I show how I feel? The thing is the people that I am around are understanding and they have not made fun of me ( till now) but I have not become one of them because of this so should I pretend to be cheerful or continue to show how I feel?,-
"I am tired of forcing myself to do things. Maybe it is me being lazy. Maybe it is my undiagnosed ADHD. I do not know. All I know is that I hate not being able to enjoy almost *anything*. I just feel so numb and dull. I dropped almost all of my friendships with people who are not in my workplace. Have not had the motivation to talk to anyone. It just feels like a chore to me. Socializing is torturous and I get bored very quick. I cannot seem to focus on any conversation. I hate forcing myself to do the most simple things, like: taking a shower, putting on makeup, cooking, cleaning, even playing videogames. I am a huge WoW nerd, so I should be excited for the new patch and game. But, I am not. I got amped up when I saw the trailer, but now, I rather not play it. I rather not play anything. Just recently, I forced myself to play Bioshock again. It is been years since I visited Rapture. I *love* Rapture. But why is it so boring to play? I used to have so much fun.. How do you get out of this funk? I do not want to feel like this and it is ruining my life. Not to mention, my SO and I have not been doing well because of it. I just feel..nothing. I need help, but I do not want a therapist or any new diet plans. None of that copypaste bullshit. What *actually* works? Also, I forgot to mention that I smoke weed daily. I heard that it can make depression worse and I have been using it for almost two years now. Is this something I should only do at night? I originally used it for sleep.","I hate forcing myself to do the most simple things, like: taking a shower, putting on makeup, cooking, cleaning, even playing videogames.

"dropped back into a depression, feels like i travelled back in time anyone else feel like this? about this time a year ago i went through a very rough patch due to depression, and it was one of the lowest points in my life. i slowly but surely started to get better, or rather, more numb. eventually i was ok. not happy, but i could function fine. fast forward to today and i suddenly dropped back into my depressed mindset. it is as though i just woke up from a year long sleep, like i would been going through some fugue state. it is weird and scary but also familiar and comfortable in the worst ways. i feel so awful but life also feels more real than it has in the past year. im suddenly remembering all of my regrets and aspirations and relationships that i had just pushed down and suppressed and it is awful but also it feels like i have found a missing part of myself? this is ramble-y and i do not know if it makes any sense but i just wanted to put it out there.","dropped back into a depression, feels like i travelled back in time anyone else feel like this?

Okay so I am doing a really shitty job of keeping up with this journal. So Sam came and went. Not before I went to a wedding and got drunk and told her parents that I was in love with her . Yea.. umm.. I am gay. I then told her that I thought moving to Oregon was a bad bad idea. Not because I was in love with her but because moving to a city for a boy that you are in love with but has no interest in you. Not such a good idea. so anyways that made things all fucked up and she left and we were not on the best terms besides that the roommate thing just kind of fell apart. I did not get the apartment across from shaye because of credit issues. So now I am going to just move into her place. We will see how that turns out.. If we kill each other or not. I am not on the lease so if it sucks I can just move out there are a few boys that are into me. However I do not think that my soul really wants to be with anyone right now. I have something wrong with my heart I am doing blood work on Monday to figure out what is going on. And I took last week off for no reason at all. So I guess a lot has happened in the last 15 days. I should really try to keep up with this journal.,"Okay so I am doing a really shitty job of keeping up with this journal.

"I have realized that I made a big mistake by starting this blog. It serves no purpose to put feelings out for public view, so I have deleted the entries from the last six months. I was going to explain some things, but thought better of it. I think a small part of my old self has awakened again. I am a bit ashamed of all the whining I have done here. I am embarrassed that I have sought out people in my life for emotional support when I should have dealt with things privately, on my own. When I lost my mind to grief, I forgot everything that I knew. As the old adage goes: you come into this world alone, you live alone, you die alone. You solve your problems alone, needs to be added. The intense pain of grief can warp your mind, impair your judgment and make you do foolish things that you will later regret. I am sorry if I have upset anyone, but my intention was simply an attempt at self-help, not to change the world. I was simply searching for a way to try to deal with and escape from this pain. I have always appreciated the supportive comments left by people and I thought I had expressed that before. I never thought anyone had an expectation that I would contact them or would even really want me to contact them. I am after all, a stranger to those who have read my words. I was getting to the point where I was starting to consider emailing some of the people who have posted comments, just to thank them, but now I think that it is better that I do not. This is the old, public version of me writing to day. I have pushed most of the real, troubled me back down into a box for a little while. I have resolved only to let her out when I am alone. In this blog, I did dwell on many of the same things again and again, but I was surprised that I could actually find some release by repeatedly talking about the same thing. I think this will be my last entry, so goodbye and good luck.","I was going to explain some things, but thought better of it.

Why does anyone care? Its not like my life can get any better it does not do no good talking to anybody either because I just end up turning them against me my best friend a guy that I look up to as a brother does not even want anything to do with me anymore.

"Fuck Everything &amp; Everyone I decided to make a different account for this, because I need to get all of this off my chest. I hate myself and I hate my life. I feel trapped at an absolute dead end in my life, and I am not even in my twenties yet. I might as well be, considering everything I have to do. I turned 17 a few months ago, and things have only gotten worse. My parents are completely delusional and cannot grasp the fact that thet cause suffering for their own benefit. They would punch you in the face and find any excuse in the book to give a reason behind what they did, even if there was not one. My mom is an asshole, to put it nicely. She is very controlling. I have called and made my own therapy appointments only to find out she cancelled them, resulting in me having to find a different therapist AND doctor twice because they would not take me because of canceling so many times, and I still have not found either, so no therapy or medication. I have next to no friends because of how she is, coupled with my inability to speak without getting anxiety. My dad is a lazy dirtbag who fights with me constantly for no reason other than he hates me. He hates how liberal I am, he hates the people I like, whatever I like he probably hates. He sits in front of a TV all day watching shit, he bitches about anything he can, yet does absolutely nothing to fix the issue that he is the main cause of. No clean dishes? I am in the wrong even though he does not rinse his or even bring them to the sink. Pills went missing? He takes more than he is supposed to and forgets and goes into a rage. So on and so forth. I honestly do not look forward to waking up anymore. I can only find peace at night and then I usually get less sleep than I should. Of course I am 'lazy' for sleeping in. More gets done quicker in less time when I get up than the whole time they have been up. I hate this stupid town and I hate my life. It feels like I am destined for absolute failure. School puts a heavy amount of pressure on me too. I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up, that would be ideal honestly.

"No doubt in my mind that since I have been taking Zoloft, I do dream a lot more and sometimes very vividly. Most of mine do not make any sense either .. but on occasion, my remembered dreams are so real, it is almost spooky. (If only those dreams were somewhat romantic, well then I would not be bringing this up, would I? .. lol) Another thing I noticed is that if I am asleep and my cell phone rings, I get up, walk a few feet away, answer, carry a short conversation and afterwards, I have no recollection whatsoever. It reminds me of sleep walking. That is so unusual and strange to me.

"I think I am having a nervous breakdown I have struggled off and on for about 10 years with anxiety and depression. The latter half has been mostly on. Recently my psychiatrist changed my medication from Zoloft to Effexor because the Zoloft had pretty much plateaued and then started working less. I do not think the Effexor is having a very good effect on me. My depression has been worse than ever. On top of that I found out that my dog has bone cancer and likely will not live more than 8-12 months. She is only 6 and she has been my entire world since I adopted her and she has helped me through a lot of difficult times. Because of these things my moods have been very bad, and I had to leave work a few days ago and I have not been back since, and I am pretty sure they are going to fire me because I am still new. Although the job was adding to my stress because they failed to tell me that we would be working mandatory overtime EVERY SINGLE DAY. I do not have much of a support system. My mom is pissed at me about work, and I am living with my grandfather who just does not get it. I do not really have much in the way of friends which is I guess why I am ranting on Reddit looking for some kind of support. I do not really know what to do. I am going to call my psychiatrist Monday to set up an appointment and hopefully get off Effexor. I want to find a job that is less intense than this one, and less hours. Hopefully part time.

At this point I have no idea how to even get back to the pathetic life I used to have.

I still have three more papers.. WTF is wrong with me.. I have not worked in 5 years, I live in a property owned by my parents and live off 100 dollars a month that is from settlement from an accident (it will end very soon). I go weeks at a time without leaving the house.

"I am 61 and for almost two years have been dealing with anxiety. It is strange the way of hitting and I would like to know from some of you experts if it is typical GAD. For almost two years I have been awakened almost every day at about 5:30 out of sound sleep with this feeling of anxiety. At first it hit my spine, now my stomach. If I take a xanax it will dissipate and not bother me much until later in the day. Again, no matter what I am doing I can feel it start to build, take a xanax and go on with life. By late afternoon it is gone and does not return until the next day. During this period my thyroid has been going haywire, probably from four surgeries in four years, the last being two months ago..a total knee repacement.. About sox weels before this surgery, after changing my thyroid meds a bit, the anxiety had left me. I was fine through the operation and then about three weeks after, it was back! Before the operation I was beginning to get some real bouts of rolling depression but they are gone for now .. just anxiety. The thing that I question is that it is the same no matter what is or has happened in my life for the day. I can have a great, relaxed day or a hectic, chaotic day and the next day will be exactly the same. My environment does not seem to affect it. Is all of this typical of GAD or should I redress my thyroid or other hormonal screw ups? Thanks for reading. It is really getting me down!","I am 61 and for almost two years have been dealing with anxiety.

My parents has been very nice and understanding since I told them about my depression. But when he said something along the lines ofno one stays in bed all day, everybody has to get up, you have friends who take the bus to work and work all night long. Why should you get special treatment? The only one who can change how you feel is you.

"I am new and my message does not seem to fit anywhere else. I have been suffering from depression since I was 15 (now 21) but I have only recently thought of it as wouldepression' as I used to think it was just me and all my feelings were real. It started with wanting to end up in hospital - get hit by a car etc. I felt useless and boring and unwanted by my family or anyone. Felt like I was jus in the way wherever I went. I felt empty and the only escape I ever had was fantasizing about the day I die - that release that I would feel from everything. So I used to write suicide notes and when I could read them without crying then I would deem myself ready. Or I would think that if I could starve myself for a week then I would be ready. (This one I could not do) finally it all got too much. In my head, my parents were so disappointed in me that they would be better off without me and to my sisters I was too annoying that they would not miss me. Up until now I had jus cut myself discreetly. So I took 80 paracetamol (not knowing then that they cannot actually kill you) and jus sat around waiting - half excited half scared. Nothing happened for ages and I started to get more scared - what would my parents think? Would they cope? Would they blame themselves? So I threw up and called an ambulance myself. I will never get over how hurt they were by what I had done and so will never do that again. But I still think bout it. When ever things get too hard. I think how can I make it look like an accident as I know they could handle that much better than suicide. I have been on antidepressants for 8 months now. For the 3rd time. But it seems that they are just putting a 'blanket' over how I am feeling and I am not addressing the real issues; not that I know what they are. I cannot get motivated to study, go to class, go out, anything. I do not care. I do not see the point in living a miserable life and what if there is no point? what if our worlds are all the creation of our minds and once our minds are dead, so is our world so there is no one left hurting once were gone? What is the point to a miserable life when it could all be ended now? I do not think suicide is the right way to go - I believe only god, whatever you conceive him to be (if anything) should have the only power over life and death, but why does he take some people and not others? (More specifically, me?) I pray that he will take me next - give me the cancer meant for someone who loves life - but as yet has been to no avail. But if all we are to do is to be alive then die, why can I not decide to take my death into my own hands, like so many people do what they want with their lives? Of course, there is always the factor of limbo - do people who commit suicide really end up in limbo? I suppose what scares me even more is that - going through the pain and anguish of suicide just to end up in limbo - with just your mind, thinking away for ever.. are my feelings wrong? Is it a chemical reaction in my brain? Or do I just not belong in this life? So confused! And just do not see the point in being here - anyone have the answers I am looking for? Life is pointless.","I have been suffering from depression since I was 15 (now 21) but I have only recently thought of it as wouldepression' as I used to think it was just me and all my feelings were real.

"Crashing In Sorry this is long. I have been depressed since I was 15. First signs were at age 4. I found pot and stayed high for 8 years. Clean and sober for 30 years, I never stopped having suicidal thoughts despite medication. So I tried to bury the pain in relationships, which did not work either. I have been married three times in recovery. I had a daughter who I love very much, and we used to be very close. She became a reason to live. Then 4 years ago she did not want to live with me 1/2 time any more. She became argumentative and we fought a lot. Last year I found out she was accusing me of sexual abuse, with help from her mom ( first wife) and therapist, which is not true. The therapist never reported the abuse, and told daughter I have NPD, which also is not true. So I got a guardian ad litem to investigate and found my daughter was suicidal, claiming PTSD because of the alleged molestation. The lawyer never helped my daughter, sparking a slide into deeper depression. My wife and parents did not do much to try to help. They got angry when I begged them to step in. Suidical ideation and inappropriate attention-getting threats became an actual plan, and a way to do it without leaving the stain of suicide. Then at work I made a $5 billion discovery that is extremely disruptive in the industry I work in. My quarter million dollar program found out millions are being spent on the wrong strategy. And 1/2 my team works on the other strategy at the same time as they are helping me, so they are taking steps to undermine the findings. Lately they gave up trying to block the discovery, and the fact that we can literally feed more people with no more land used for farming, by raising more animals (naturally) with the same amount of feed. I am getting invited to speak globally about the discovery. The suicidal thoughts deepen, knowing the disruption to status quo is only beginning. Just before Christmas my third wife moved out, and I spent Christmas alone because my parents were sick. Last night she told my mom she intends to get a divorce. The medicine is not working. The AA old timers are saying I am depressed because I am not working the steps correctly. I am going to 2-3 meetings a day, most days. In two days I am shutting down the case I opened to try to get help for my daughter. I can hardly work, because I cannot complete thoughts very well any more, being so depressed. I have been complaining about feeling depressed and suicidal, because it is true, and it became a way to relate to the world, which makes people leave. The spiral is getting tighter, and it feels like a black hole is pulling me in. I cannot imagine facing another divorce feeling this low. Mom said to get a roast beef out of the freezer and cook it with some potatoes and carrots and stop thinking about negative things. I went to Landmark and they say this is all just a story, and part of a racket I created to avoid responsibility. They say I can create something different by changing my story. I have tried a rainbow of medicine, and tomorrow I increase Latuda from 20 mg to 40, and keep the trintellex at 20, per MD. I cannot do anything now because third wife will get 1/2, and parents are too old to deal with my belongings. My thoughts turn to seeing if I can find someone else who will love me anyway, or giving up. I want to give up but not really. I really want to live, but I cannot see any hope. And I cannot stand the thought of being alone. Any help, hope or ideas would be appreciated. Thank you.","Then 4 years ago she did not want to live with me 1/2 time any more.

"I lost my job, i am in the worst place i have ever been, and nothing makes sense or feels fair. I have worked at the same place for nearly three years. It is an entry level retail job, but i have not ever had anything else, so it was really the only thing that made me feel validated. Recently, for the fifth time i got passed up for a promotion, but this time marked the end. The girl who got promoted over me is one of my best friends in the world. She is absolutely amazing, and i am so happy for her, but it was the hardest to accept. She started about a year ago, and i helped train her and build her up. Fairly quickly, we became the face of the job that we did. She was my partner in everything, and i feel like i would be there for the things she could not do, and she would be there for the things i could not do. Seeing her success is the most proud i have ever been, but it is made me the most miserable. I basically found out that after busting my ass for over two years, my partner was going to be my boss. I hate that. I lost the person that was my rock in the things that i did. I do not want to work under her, i wanted to be there with her. She told me when it happened out of respect for me, and i turned in my resignation the next day. Now the only thing that made me feel validated and gave me security is gone, and i do not know what to do. My friend understood everything of course. More than just being my partner in work, she was the only person who could tell when things got really bad for me. When i hide how miserable i am, she is the first person to notice, and the only person who understands and will tell me what i need to hear. If there is any upside to all of this, it is that at least i still have my friend. In my overthinking and fear, i guess i was afraid this would change things. I learned pretty fast how much care and respect she holds for me, and i do not think anything will change that. I hope not. This job was beating me down. I trained a lot of our best staff, and i had a lot of associate come to me before management, feeling like i was more of a leader to them than our actual leadership was. We lost a lot of people due to burnout and frustration with management, but i know that i always cared about the people i got to train and help, and took a lot of pride in their success. Even after getting underpaid, undervalued, and shafted at every turn, i always stayed because i cared about the people i worked with and i would not give up on them. One would think that leaving a shit situation would make me happy, but it just does not. Despite my 2+ years retail and leadership experience, it is been hard to find another job. Most people offer me less money than i made before (not much) and basically completely ignore any qualifications i actually have. I am in school. I finish community college this year and will move to a four year school assuming i can as my performance is not amazing. I I want to pursue grad school to gain qualifications as an industrial/org psychologist, but everything seems so far away. I feel like with being a Psych major i am just going to end up equally as useless with a four year degree, and even if grad school does work out, that is overall another four years from now. I have to pay bills, and i hate feeling so useless. I am not going to starve and die or anything. My family has money, and has offered to help me pay bills if i cannot find a job, but that just makes things worse in a way. I moved away from home because i wanted to be my own person. It has been three years and i have not had to ask for help from anybody. I hate the thought that i will have to rely on these people who have given me everything to give me more. It is not their fault that i am a fuck up. A man said to the universe: Sir, I exist! However, replied the universe, The fact has not created in me A sense of obligation. - Stephen Crane I know that life is not fair. I know nobody owes me anything, but i hate that it seems like i always end up last. My friend gets to be happy, my other friend practically runs the store now (but not enough to help, because the SM makes all the decisions and she is shitty), but i have the least and i get the least. My staff and coworkers get people to hang out with. Everyone gets to go home to someone that loves them when they fail and gets comfort from that. I do not get that. I am alone, and i have always been. The joy i get is from making other people happy because i cannot make myself happy. I want to make these people never have to feel how i do. It is just so fucking unfair that things just seem to work out better for everyone else. I do not know what to do, i do not know where to go, and i do not know how to be happy. This is the worst it has been. Usually i go home for a bit to take my mind off things, or can occupy my time with videos games or something to take my mind off things. Nothing is fun right now. Not turning to alcohol is hard. I really feel like things will get better but.. how fucking long does it take? What do i do until then?","I lost my job, i am in the worst place i have ever been, and nothing makes sense or feels fair.

"Can people stop telling me that hiking and exercise is the magical cure? It just frustrates me so much, and continues the perpetual cycle of ""well if I cannot make myself better through such simple actions I must be even more of a failure than I realised"". I appreciate the science behind it, releasing endorphins yada yada, but if I cannot bring myself to drink water or get out of bed how am I supposed to go for a jog? If I am so insecure about myself why would running and jiggling in front of everyone to imagine their sneery comments going to make me feel better? Where do I find the energy to go for a hike when being awake for three hours makes my body physically ache? I get it, it is helpful for a lot of people but telling me to go get my yoga pants on and be at one with nature will not cure a thing and by repeating that useless mantra you are making me worse. Rant over, I am going back to bed. Edit: a few people telling me if I exercise I will lose weight and feel better about myself. I only need to try it apparently. On the advice of my doctor, I have tried it, even walking. I do walk, every day, no matter how I feel. I also do not need to lose weight and being overweight is not the reason I am depressed (because I am not overweight). Just saying to stop preaching the exercise mantra as if it is the only thing that could possibly fix what is a very real mental illness that has nothing to do with how often I move, flex or jump. My point is that it is not working.","If I am so insecure about myself why would running and jiggling in front of everyone to imagine their sneery comments going to make me feel better?

"Abnormal I am so used to being depressed and anxious I am amazed how people can act normally in general. I am like how do they do it? I am so used to feeling uncomfortable in my skin that its normal for me to feel awkward and weird in social situations. The fact that people everywhere do not have to deal with this everyday and just can ""be themselves"" without breaking a nervous sweat blows my mind. I feel abnormal and tired of it. This is the part people do not understand. I have met shy people and they are effective communicators once they get over that initial hesitancy of speaking. When you are overcome with social anxiety, depression, and feelings of incompetency its damn near impossible to speak or want to. Every word you utter to someone is misinterpreted because half the time its not heard or not what you meant to say. So frustrating I cannot explain it but its killing me.

"I am new to the forum and this is the most interesting thread I have found so far. I am in my mid fifties and have suffered from depression for as long as I can remember. It is got a lot worse lately. I have been an ""underachiever"" because of it, but now I have slowly lost just about everything. I have been on Prozac, Effexor, etc., and I am now on Zispin. This latest one makes me sleep a lot. I could not get up for work even if I could hold down a job. I have gone from being a successful business man to losing wife, estranging my kids and grand kids, I am unemployed, out of money and running out of hope. It is time that depression in men was seen as the problem it really is. How many of us are performing so far below what we are intellectually, physically and emotionally capable of? It is not just a personal problem. It is a problem for our families and friends and I believe it robs our society of a lot of valuable people. Here is hoping that there really is a solution out there somewhere.","I am new to the forum and this is the most interesting thread I have found so far.

"Hi folks, I have only discovered this topic after making several previous posts I am from a traditional Asian culture, but now half-westernized on migration to Australia since age 6. I have had a long history that stems right to my parents' histories before I was born. To cut it very short, my father has schizoid/schizotypal/socially withdrawn personality traits, and my mother has dependent traits, so they basically had a loveless marriage (common in my culture). There is a long history of parental quarrelling and physical abuse on my mother before and after I was born, some of which I heard as a child to early teens. I was seldom exposed socially growing up, and I had few school friends. I was also 'born' a quiet person, but this and lack of socializing made me a withdrawn kid. When I was about 4, I believe I experienced one psychotic episode (I isaw' 2 caped 'grim reapers' at that time), since which I have no further experiences. I experienced a few bouts of depression during secondary school, for which I did not seek help because of my shyness and parental/cultural stigma that wouldepression does not exist' (thankfully my family has ditched that attitude now). During that time, I had many suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide maybe 3 times but did not tell anyone about it. A very terrible incident also happened towards the end of high school - one night, I physically assaulted my father while he was quarrelling with mom, and he was hospitalized. I got charged with assault, but no conviction was recorded after I did psychotherapy for anger control - that was also the only therapeutic contact with psychological/psychiatric services I had until very recently. That incident, although I felt numb through that time, has been scarred into my memory - I can still recall the events, and my conscience is still wrecked over it, though I continue to fight it and let it go. At school, I was a top-end academic achiever in science and math. I was named dux of the school on graduation. Upon entering university, my depression became worse mainly because of increased social isolation. I was still shy and withdrawn, I lost contact with my high school friends (they also saw me as 'weird', but I was also a bit narcissistic towards them at some times - I think it was an unconscious aggressive reaction towards them), and failed to make any lasting friendship with university peers. One year into university, I started studying Medicine, which I am still doing at the moment. However I felt that course had over time did not improve me, though I did make few friends. I still felt unable to socialize with peers, even though I was in constant contact with them through many lectures and tutorials. Even though I was an average performer, I felt I struggled heavily through the years with study. Late last year, my depression hit a new low - my parents had another quarrel, and I was studying psychiatry which forced me to realize the extensiveness of my past and current problems. It was another awful time - I lost a lot of self-confidence/esteem, became more withdrawn. I ended up failing my first practical exam but still passed given my past satisfactory academic record - the faculty put it down to lack of practice, but the truth is because of what I experienced leading up to the exam. In this year however my depressive bouts became much worse - my few friends had deferred, and I was left with no friends, despite still knowing the others 'by name'. My experience during this year was largely negative - I felt harassed by teaching doctors, peers, being looked at as a 'weirdo' and excluded from conversations and their social outings (whether this was a valid view, I am finding out now by resocializing with them - my main aim at the moment). Over the last 2 months I had about 5 more depressive episodes, and attempted suicide 3 times, again nobody knew about them. It became a frantic situation - I approached the faculty dean for help, but he only recommended me a psychiatrist, who he was supposed to contact before I contacted him. However that psychiatrist was not notified, and I felt very angry about it and thought that nobody was out there to help me. In retrospect, my view was unrealistic - help only exists on a professional level, something I knew long before but did not acknowledge at that time, making me upset. My depression faded away a few days later. A few nights ago, I had a short dispute with mom, got upset and this eventually led to me joining this forum after a quick search on the net. Why am I writing this intro? Several reasons. I want to tell my story to others, and feel this is a stepping stone to encourage myself. I also want others not yet aware that depression can affect ANYONE, even the best of us, even those involved in the medical profession (up to 30% of junior doctors suffer from depression, and up to 10% have attempted/committed suicide). I want to improve my own situation - most of all, learning to deal with feelings of sadness and negatively that has crippled me mentally in the past, and my lack of sociability which does not help my situation. I know deep inside I am capable of pulling through, of being able to live a normal healthy life because I am aware of my problems and have the power to deal with them. Finally, although I am still a student, I believe my position is privileged and that I should use what knowledge I have learnt to help others as best as I can, something I will be bound to by Hippocratic Oath on finishing school. I am grateful that such a forum exists for others and me to express our thoughts, experiences and feelings, and that there are people out there who devote themselves for such causes. Thank you all.","I experienced a few bouts of depression during secondary school, for which I did not seek help because of my shyness and parental/cultural stigma that wouldepression does not exist' (thankfully my family has ditched that attitude now).

"it do not get no better than this Last night was a success. I was in truly rare form. My last non-fuzzy memory is of chugging beers at a friend is around 10:30, but highlights of the night include: making out with two of my girl friends; flashing one of my more reserved friends (reaction: ""Did she just flash me??""); waking up this morning with a stranger is cell phone on my desk (a peek through the phone book, and I was pretty sure he is not a law student), but thankfully no owner of the cell phone in my bed; doing way too many shots when, after being asked if I wanted to do shots, I responded, ""I really should not do whiskey shots.. Bring me the tequila!"" and apparently a solid effort at drunk dialing, if the outgoing call log on my cell is any indication. We had a really fun night, but then getting shitty with friends is always a good time. I think I was still drunk when I went to Civ Pro this morning, hmm. The bar we went to is dead on Thursday nights (though really packed on Friday and Saturday nights). It was nice, though -- we had the bar to ourselves. About 40 people showed up, and after talking to us for awhile, the owner said he would give us drink specials on Thursday nights if we came back. He even comped a lot of our drinks, which was cool. We will definitely be back. I liked this place already, but this is true incentive. A couple people are out tonight, but I lost my steam after Happy Hour. I just felt too exhausted to even think about going out. I made macaroni & cheese, sat on the couch, and watched TV. It is been a nice, quiet night.","The bar we went to is dead on Thursday nights (though really packed on Friday and Saturday nights).

I am sure there is not some magic formula for getting past actually having to admit that you have a really serious problem, but I was just wondering how some of you were able to get past that feeling of embarrassment and shame that keeps you from getting help, and telling the people you love the truth. Every day is getting harder and harder, especially now that my family knows I have been lying. I really thought telling them would make everything a little easier (lying = instant paranoia!), but now I cannot stop thinking about how I have ruined my relationships with them forever, and I am even more hopeless than I was before. How can I get past this embarrassment?","I was not taking money from them or anything (I do not live with my parents, and my husband has a great job and I do not technically HAVE to work) but now that I have come clean about it my mother says she feels ""manipulated.""

From the moment I wake up I wish I was still asleep. Thats the hardest part about going to bed at night you know? I would love to just sleep forever but every night I have trouble going to bed knowing I am gonna wake up. It is the worst part of the day.,-
"Cried in a bathroom stall I am not the type to post this kind of things, but I hate myself. I try my best to socialize, to be emphatic but I end up here every single time. Alone, boring and fucking depressed. Sometimes I think maybe I should be dead instead of someone else who had way better success at life than I did. I hate feeling this way and I take it out on my family when I cannot control it. No matter how hard I try, socially I get nowhere, no friends, no relationships and no happiness. So here I am, if you guys know any sort of assassin hit me up, I might actually pay you to take me out. Save me the trouble of doing it myself. Peace out.",Sometimes I think maybe I should be dead instead of someone else who had way better success at life than I did.
"I have just now realized now, after 24+ years of experiencing it, that what I have suffered from is depression. Soon after that, I spoke to my dad about it, and learned he would been on AD is for over 10 years now, and he said he probably could have used them from the time he was about 15 years old on. He also said my paternal grandmother is side of the family was all just like us (my dad and I are almost carbon copies of each other, except he is always seemed much more ""perfect"" to me than I am. ) He also said my oldest half brother is also on AD is. I also talked to my oldest daughter (who is 21 year-old), and she said she is been on AD is a few times too. I can say also that I learned many years after his death that my maternal grandfather experienced severe depression before I was born. He had shock therapy multiple times it seems..but I do not know if his problems were entirely from the extreme horrors he experienced in WWII, or a combination of that plus other problems. When I knew him he was always a sweet loving, rather quiet, man (and my favorite person in the world other than my dad.) My dad said he never associated my problems with depression (of course, neither did I), but now it all clicks. I wish I would known all this when I was younger, that depression had not had the stigma it had back in the 1970s & 80s, and that I could have gotten treatment back then. Of course, if I had, I would not have the same life I have now, so I guess I cannot complain about that (and honestly would not change a thing..I would not risk losing my kids or what I have accomplished, no matter how crooked and difficult the path as been). But I will definitely watch my young kids now for signs of depression (especially my 4 year-old daughter, since she seems to have a similar personality to my dad and I). If I see it, they will get the treatment they need immediately! So in that sense I think this is a blessing..knowledge is power.","Soon after that, I spoke to my dad about it, and learned he would been on AD is for over 10 years now, and he said he probably could have used them from the time he was about 15 years old on.

"I posted here sometime in December I think. I was having tons of digestive problems, well it is been about 4 months now and I am still having them, but now I also feel extremely fatigued all the time too, I have had test after test and seen doctor after doctor, everything comes back negative. I was actually put on Zoloft for about a month but taken off of it to try other things b/c that was not doing the trick either. I am back to thinking that it is all in my head, I am now on b12 shots but those are not doing anything either. I feel like a zombie, I have zero energy and zero motivation to do anything. Even the simplest task like styling my hair seems like a huge chore that I just want to put off. All I want to do is sleep all day. One thing I have noticed is that man do I ever waste time, I mean I literally do nothing but waste time most of the day. I only have about two hours of class per day and no job so I have tons of free time to waste away. I analyzed what I did in the past hour and it basically went like this: The entire time I was talking to myself non-stop, analyzing things, analyzing my situation, thinking of motivational quotes etc.. I tend to do that all day. For about 15 minutes I stood around leaning against a wall, the next 15 minutes i leaned against the television, then I went and lied down for a while all while still thinking and analyzing things in my head, then I came on the computer to just look at random, pointless things. And that is pretty much how most of my time is spent, I might spend an hour or so just standing around or sitting doing nothing but thinking or daydreaming, that cannot possibly be healthy and I obviously have way too much free time, I am just not sure if this is what is in turn causing all my fatigue and sickness. Have I become so addicted to this lifestyle that my mind will purposely make me feel sick so I have an excuse to live like this?","I only have about two hours of class per day and no job so I have tons of free time to waste away.

"I began to openly discuss my depression to my friends. It was very painful to discuss but I think it is a step in the right direction. Up to now, I have never discussed my depression with anyone besides my husband and my therapist. I have slight PTSD from when I was kid and a teacher had been ""concerned"" for me by some disturbing behavior. I felt even more misunderstood and felt so much anguish that I became really good at disguising my depression. I hid it under a fake, likable, version of myself because I wanted to fit in and feel like I belong. Currently, my closest friends are my coworkers but they the most judgmental people I have known. We became close by commiserating together at work. Fast forward a few years, I am finally starting to feel better after seeking help for my depression. I have been seeing a therapist for over a year, began taking antidepressants two months ago, and have been taking cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. As I begin to feel better, I also feel more miserable hanging out with my friends. I decided to be more open with the people around me about my depression. I revealed it today for the first time with one of my closest friends. It was incredibly scary for me.. I have not felt this vulnerable in a long time. My friends typically see me as a guarded person with a hard exterior, but I felt tears welling in my eyes. He was very surprised to hear, but I am not the first person he knows with depression so it was reassuring to know he did not think I was some sort of freak. He also commended me for taking steps in getting better and encouraged me to continue talking about it. It was a positive experience overall. I then decided to tell another friend later in the day because I was feeling good after the discussion I had earlier. It went a little differently though.. His first question was, ""what do you have to be depressed about?!"" which instantly flooded my mind with negative feelings of remorse. I tried my best to keep calm and answer his questions honestly. I explained that it is not any thing or anyone that is making me *feel* depressed. It is a mental condition I have which causes me to be in a persistent state of sadness and worthlessness. He asked me if I understand where Eric is coming from (his bipolar nephew that he sometimes mentions), and I said yes. He then seemed to become more curious and asked me many questions about what it is like. In the end, I feel like I educated him on depression and hopefully helped debunk his belief that depression is just a feeling that people should be able to snap out of. I honestly do not think I could have these conversations if I was in the state I was even a month ago. Even today, I felt myself slipping into the familiar downward spiral. I do not know what kept me composed today, but I am so proud of myself for making it through the conversation without snapping or becoming defensive. Perhaps if I had these conversations in reverse order, it could have been a completely different experience. I hope this inspires others to talk about it, seek help and be open to receiving it. It was quite uncomfortable but I am happy to create an opening for other people to understand what we are going through.","I began to openly discuss my depression to my friends.

"Can depression make you see only the 'negative' aspects of your SO? I do not know what to think anymore. I am in a relationship and maybe we are just not meant to be.

"Has your family always ignored your problem? I think the hardest part of being depressed since I was a kid is how absolutely ignored I was/am by my family. My parents split up when I was 5 and my father died when I was 10. My family completely sweeped it under the rug like I was supposed to be completely ok with it and it has never been a topic of discussion at home. I walked around sad, slumbered over, quiet, avoided eye contact and stared into the distance for years and years and no one ever assumed proper to ask if there is something wrong with me. The only time they sent a psychologist my way was when they had to determine who I should live with after divorce. My mother to this day seems absolutely oblivious to my suffering. I do not ever feel like telling them for they will propably assume I am ungrateful and spoilt. I have had everything! They sent me to school, fed me, put clothes on my back. What else could I possibly need? I do not want to burden or blame anyone for what has happened but just I feel so abandoned.","My family completely sweeped it under the rug like I was supposed to be completely ok with it and it has never been a topic of discussion at home.

"I feel like I am not cut out to be an adult in this life. r/GetMotivated hardly helps me so I do not know why I still visit it.

I know it works for some people, but that stuff just makes me angry because it is *so* not me. I am not a fighter. I do not understand how to just keep pushing and keep going on like that. I guess I have been doing that somewhat if I have made it to be 21 but I am so fucking miserable. I do not understand how people get motivated and ""just deal with it"" and all that shit.

"I went to Lauren is place last night with Lee and watched Takashi Miike is Audition with them and Loro is boyfriend Thomas. It was great. Especially for a Friday the 13th.

"What is the point of coming up if you are gonna go down? I moved to a new city with the love of my life after 5 years of loving him. I was ready to propose, I looked at rings, I called jewelers. I debated getting a ring of meteorite, you know? He is super nerdy, super cute. Science geek and all. I would like to think every guy buying rings thinks about the meteorite ring haha. Then he tells me that he feels like a she. I loved her no matter what. I told her I still loved her and that she is going to be one of the most beautiful girls ever. I still planned to propose. I loved her more that she is her true self. Then my heart gets broken. She tells me that she cannot see a future with me together. She tells me that she is only interested in women. There was not much for me to do but respect her true feelings. I could not force her to love me. For a few weeks I lost my best-friend and my future. We still lived together, music helped, weed helped. I made friends. I tried to be happy, and for a little I think I really was okay. But it was so stormy, one tip of the scale and I was back to being broken. Then I find out that she is seeing other guys. My heart was gone, the only feeling is that feeling when your heart drops to your stomach. It is a little harder to swallow, did life get harder? Did she make it easier? I do not know. I was not good enough for her. She says otherwise. I know she means the best for me with her heart but man, did it hurt the same. I ask her to give me time, as a roommate, as a past lover, give me time to heal before you see someone. Please, just give me some time to heal. But she could not wait. I do not blame her, she is discovering herself. She is beautiful. I never had a chance. There are better men for her. I am broken, the pieces stomped on. I try. I go to work. I exercise. I eat healthy. I tell myself improve for yourself and no one else. It is a lie. Life seems to drag on, I try to smile, I miss my best friend. I try to act like everything is alright to her. She cannot be seeing me like this, it hurts her too. I meet a guy. He is cute, a little simple, but cute. We start to hang out, workout together even. He takes me to some of the most beautiful places, I try to swallow my doubt and bring my heart back. Somedays, I could swallow just fine around him. When I was sure I was ready, I told him. It was too late. I took too long. I was just dead. I made plans, wrote good bye letters, planned that my little siblings would get what money I had left. I know it is selfish, I know it can get better. I even tried to find a program that sends emails at a certain time so everyone could get a good nights sleep before they received my letter. I could not do it. I stood on the edge of a bridge, the edge of a cliff, wore my favorite clothes. Listened to my favorite songs. Every time I could not do it.

"I willingly admit that I am a sufferer of depression. But in my case, I think the problem was education more than anything. I recognize that I have been depressed pretty much from as far back as I can remember.

I think that I tried to destroy myself in other ways like smoking and minor drugs and not taking care of myself. Basically I was waiting for things to either get better or finish falling apart. About a year ago, my new doctor recognized the symptoms in me and offered me help in the form of Zoloft and some counseling which changed my life.

"Hello, I am new here. I am 36 and have had depression since the age of 9. I am supposed to take Lexapro every day, but often I forget. Memory / concentration is poor, one of the areas of the brain that depression screws with, the others being sleep, appetite, and libido. Here is my thing .. I am so gosh darn afraid to do anything! It is hard at times to even face my job, I call in sick and stay in pajamas all day. I do get out of bed, but I will not bathe or brush teeth. Is not that gross! I did this on Monday and Tuesday this week. I am in school at night, it is a tele course class in geology. Last Friday we had an exam, and I did not show up for it because I did not do any reading for it. Now it is almost Wednesday, and I still have not touched the reading. We can make up the exam no later than 1 week after the exam date, so I have two days to cover several chapters. Thing is, I am SCARED CRAPLESS to even start!! It is like I have got ""freeze - itis"" and I cannot seem to study! I have been doing other things, like cleaning and laundry and doing Immigration research (trying to bring my Egyptian fiance here to the States), but have not touched the geology, even though that is been 1 on my mind for two weeks. Even this past weekend, I had no plans (as usual!) and did not crack open even one page. I fear failure, and it is so hard to ""let go and let God"".

"I have just joined up because recently things have become a little too hard to cope with alone. I have suffered with depression for as long as i can remember really. but it is hard to find people who I can talk to. I always end up feeling like a burden, i know my friends just want me to be my happy party girl self, not the unhappy honest self. so I tend to keep quiet. Would love to have people to talk to about how i feel.

"Hello all. My name is Daniel I am 23 and going to school in Bowling Green, Ohio. I have been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, ADD, and depression. I have tried various medicines for my ADD and the last one I was on was Effexor XR, usually used to treat depression but can be used for adult ADD, I was on it for a year or two and kept increasing the dosage b/c I was not seeing enough results. The medicine dosage got too high and I had a break down during the summer of 05. To vent I would cut myself and eventually attempted suicide in a Kroger parking lot. I went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed medicines, but I have grown tired of using medicines; I had a seizure while on a drug for acne. I refused to take the medicines and have been struggling with killing myself every day. I do not really like going into public due to my social anxiety and tend to turn to computer games to escape reality. I drink more caffeine than is healthy, do not sleep at night, and have fluctuations in eating. I never think I am good at anything, I built a computer last night which kind of made me feel good about myself, but that is not enough. I have stopped going to class because I do not think I am good enough and have not told anyone. I am pretty much a wreck right now and am in the process of going to the counseling center that my school offers. I do not know how much longer I can hold out before I try something else. I am struggling to even be happy around my friends, family and girl friend. They all know I think about it every day, but never say anything. It is probably because I hide my feelings and lie to them about it. I do not want to even keep going to school it feels so pointless. My girl friend wants to get married I do not even want to think about it. I do not want to get married and am too gutless to tell her. I have feelings of breaking up with her but once again I am to scared and gutless to say anything. I hate myself.","I never think I am good at anything, I built a computer last night which kind of made me feel good about myself, but that is not enough.

"Should I go to the hospital? [please respond] Minor living with adult sibling right now. Idk whether I should go to the hospital. I have had suicidal urges surface recently and I am afraid that I will succumb to the temptations and kill myself. But the hospital just seems so miserable, and my psychologist told me if I wanted to go I would stay until my parents arrived (2 weeks).

"What a great topic!! The news always makes me cry - and I end up turning it off shortly after I start watching it - why do I punish myself? My parents know that I have learned to not watch the news because of the negative effect it has on me, so if something really important is going on, they let me know. My Aunt suffers from chronic depression and delusion, and I have had numerous conversations with her on how to handle the depression because she is tried so many different things, even going to Mexico to see a Shaman. Her top 3 suggestions (and I really go by them as much as I possibly can) are: 1) Get proper sleep - this is probably the most paramount point; 2) get proper nutrition; and 3) do not watch the news. The one thing that I absolutely cannot tolerate is sad news about animals - that really sends me. When I am flipping thru channels and happen upon Animal Planet and the Animal Police are busting people because of their cruelty - I have to turn it immediately. I think I am delusional too in that I choose not to watch the news, animal stories, anything really unpleasant - I guess I try to live in my little world without negativity or sadness. I know that it is not very mature or adult, but this is my coping mechanism. I do find that when I hear or see anything sad or awful that my negativity really gets into gear, and then I am completely negative for awhile. Driving is also incredibly difficult because I commute into Washington D.C. from the suburbs and traffic is awful. I become so negative about the other drivers around me that I end up hating myself over my thoughts about them! They, of course, drive too slow and are idiots. I need to find a job close to home! I too have sometimes felt that the human race needs to think about not populating the world anymore. I would not want to raise a small child in this environment any more! I am glad my son is in college and he is the only one that I could have. But then again, I cannot wait until my sister or brother has kids so that I can be with them and spoil them rotten. Crazy is not it? I have taken others suggestions in this thread and have tried to make myself think positively the last 2 days. It is difficult but possible! I notice that my mood has brightened somewhat too. Thanks to you all for this thread, as I think it really can help!","The news always makes me cry - and I end up turning it off shortly after I start watching it - why do I punish myself?

"I am in a state of emptiness. Recently, I was in a relationship with someone who did not love me, but I loved them intensely. I had hoped eventually she would turn around, but for that time, I found deep meaning in her. Now it is over, and she does not seem to care. Meanwhile, I am in hell. It is like the past four years of my life were just a dream. I feel humiliated, used and defeated. I feel like I have nothing. I lost my job, stopped going to school, and was forced to move back in with my parents. I feel like a total failure and completely worthless. I feel like I am being punished by God, and there is no way out. Even in my dreams I cannot escape the pain. I cannot see the good in anything anymore. Everywhere, I see pain and suffering, with no hope. Even when I meet incredible people who am in awe of, I feel almost envious, knowing that I am a worthless, useless nothing in the presence of angels. I still have some friends, but have grown distant from them. Seeing their success, no matter how minute, just reminds me of my worthlessness. I have nothing to offer the world. I am without purpose. Even when I have enough things to distract me, my ex is still in my dreams or nightmares every night. Before I met her, I got my life on track, was kicking ass in school, and headed for something. I know I cannot blame her, but I just feel so stupid for getting caught up in her drama for no reason. What a waste. I do not know. I have been reflecting on my life a lot. I am 27 and have nothing to show for it. I feel like I have to make drastic changes. Liquor and drugs are not doing me any good. I do not know what the hell I want anymore. I am so lost, sometimes I do not even know if I am really alive. I feel like right now, I have to settle for mediocrity and hope for simple low - stress job that pays the bills, but I do not have any source of joy or anything really to look forward too. I have pinpointed that the major source for depression and life problems as been my self-hatred. It manifests itself in many forms, including obsessive feelings of inadequacy and incompetence, paranoia, being overly - sensitive to criticism, feeling worthless, hopeless, and giving up too easy because of those feelings. Where did all this self - hatred come from? I do not want to blame my parents at my age, but I know that how they treated me when I was younger affected me and it still lingers in my psyche. They always employed the shame approach to parenting. Anytime something happened, my father would curse at me, and lecture me on how worthless I was. He would glare at me, and I just had to sit there and listen. Sometimes I would start crying, and then he would yell at me for crying, and say shit like ""look at you, you are not even ashamed."" Shame was apparently a virtue. My mother once told me when I was 8 that she wanted to have a third child, but because I was such a disappointment, she decided against it. They hit me frequently, with a bamboo stick. I remember they would constantly compare me to their friend is children, praising them and ask me why I could not be more like them. So all this happened, but I cannot change the past. I do not want to dwell and blame my parents for their mistakes, no one is a perfect parent. I just want to get over these feelings of self - hatred and get my life in order. I have identified the source of my depression, but have not been able to change all those feelings and thought-processes that have been ingrained in me since early childhood. Does anyone have any advice on how to overcome these feelings, and gain a sense of confidence and direction back?","It is like the past four years of my life were just a dream.

"I am 25 years old single black mother and I have been struggling with depression ever since I was a small girl. Throughout the course of my life I have had a lot of share of ups and downs: parents divorced in 1985, father was on drugs, domestic abuse, severe teasing, idiotic boyfriends and the list goes on. If there were problems in the home, you dealt with it at home and kept your mouth shut tight. There is no such thing as a black woman being depressed. Black women MUST keep this aura of being strong, independent, swallow your tears, raise your children, take the blows that life throws at you and keep moving with the beat. If you did not keep moving with the beat, then you will fall through the cracks; everyone sees it and you will be considered as weak and no one will want to deal with you. Everyone around you will let you have it and you will be labeled as an outcast among your fellow black sisters and brothers. I have had a few suicide attempts and my family thought that I was just trying to get sheer childish attention as to say, ""I am a big baby, pay attention to me."" They took it as a joke and it broke my spirit down to a trillion pieces. I constantly worried what my friends, co-workers, class mates, and lovers would see me as a walking disaster waiting to happen. At the time, I did a good job of ""covering it up"" for a long time. It painfully and slowly came out. I was afraid that if I told some one that I was severely depressed, I would not get the love, support, and care that I needed: family labeled me as ""CRAZY"". So if you have any comments please feel free to let me know what you think about black women and depression.","There is no such thing as a black woman being depressed.

Nausea/heartburn from Wellbutrin I started about a week ago and was having some reflux beforehand but only really when I drank alcohol or had something really acidic. Now I am avoiding all that and I still have issues everyday. I know heartburn is a side effect but the weird thing is that I take it right in the morning and then at fine all day until the evening while I am getting ready to go to bed I am just hit with bad nausea out of no where. I avoid eating before bed as well. Wondering if anyone else has this experience. I was maybe thinking of moving it to type evening but then I am worried if there is some 12 hour delay to it I am just gunna wake up with the nausea which could be just as bad but at least it will not effect my sleep. Or maybe it will just go away with time since I am still pretty early on idk but it is really fucking with me right now,I know heartburn is a side effect but the weird thing is that I take it right in the morning and then at fine all day until the evening while I am getting ready to go to bed I am just hit with bad nausea out of no where.
"Need to talk and I have nobody. Hey all. Just need to talk, really struggling right now and trying to dig out of it. Not really sure what else to do. Pattern of behaviour: Wake up in the morning with immediate feelings of depression and loneliness. Acute feelings of being alone in bed, uncomfortable. Become compelled to flip through Bumble, Tinder because I feel a need to try and immediately correct the problem. I never (and I mean never) match. Have to fight urges to immediately abuse addictions like porn and weed. Sometimes do, sometimes do not. Prepare for work, fight off feelings of sadness about ex-girlfriend and situation it puts me in. Fight the urge to blame her for the failure of the relationship even though I logically know I am wrong or that is not fair. She just left to pursue school and had to move on, she did not do anything to me. Fight feelings of rejection and feelings of inadequacy in my value to others even though there is no reason to feel that here. Walk to work, continue to fight with anger issues re: relationships and validation. Sometimes frustration stems from lack of work success but more often than not it is physical appearance issues and relationship issues. I get caught in a loop being mad at her and being mad at myself and my capacity to deal with being alone. Auto-pilot at work. Able to do job easily, so lack of focus is a non-issue. I spend too much time on Facebook and other social media looking for outlets to expand my social network and friends. Find it very difficult to do so without appearing over-anxious or creepy and new opportunities rarely prevent themselves. Sometimes Imarket business and contact clients/potential clients. Sometimes a boost comes from having success here, but often the lack thereof is equally esteem damaging. Go home, usually bus. Already tired. Immediately engage addictions, usually beer and weed. Start watching TV or playing games and rarely stop until bed time. I will leave easy tasks like cleaning dishes, etc for weeks. Continual evasion of solving problems, instead opting to rely on substances to either forget or balance my feelings of sadness. Occasionally I have friends over, but many of them use substances as well or are in similar life situations so finding solace in these encounters is limited. Furthermore, they are my friends of many years and represent a kind of social stagnation. At night I am usually in bed by 10, not because I am out of things to do, but because I am either drunk or bored. On weekends I am lucky if I do anything outside of what I do immediately after work. I rarely feel compelled to do anything. If I get invited to a bar, I end up going and feeling alienated from everyone and 'out-of-place'. Most of the time, I just feel too tired to join my friends, but I also feel a lack of motivation because I am sure it will just be the same crowdand it appears their lives keep moving while mine does not. I am behind on adulthood. I have only recently acquired a driver is license, I just renewed my glasses prescription and only just started living on my own. I have to get my teeth taken care of and they are a source of stress and physical pain (still have wisdom teeth at 34). I have the habits of a teenager. I smoke copious amounts of weed, I drink daily and I do not pursue my interests or goals. I know the right course of action most of the time, but I actively ignore it because the amount required to get healthy is just too much. I have spent a great majority of my life single and most of my relationships aside from a few gems have been tumultuous, emotional rollercoasters. More often than not, Despite all these things I feel undervalued in my society. I think of myself as smart, funny and confident in my skills, but I feel that the rest of the world does not care and does not see those as appealing. I feel like without looks and an academic education, you can only accomplish so much and that people is standards are so high that competition for a good role in society is unlikely. I feel unable to compete when the above issues prevent me from succeeding. Motivation to do anything is lowered by the lack of acceptance in general, the feeling that I should be acceptable the way I am but am not, and my inability to seem to control that situation. It does not help that on the face of it, most people will tell me that I seem like a catch, an incredibly high-value person with lots to offerexcept that none of that seems to translate to my life, emotional attachments or stability. I am just lost.","Acute feelings of being alone in bed, uncomfortable.

"How do you talk about depression to your friends? I am really ashamed of not necessarily the depression in and of itself but the way that I have acted with it and the way that I have (so far) failed to overcome its clutches. This shame has led to me neglecting some relationships because I do not know how to talk about this without seeming really pathetic, which makes me feel even more guilty for neglecting friends that I actually do value, but just cannot bring myself to talk to.

"Failure to trust ' nothose on my side''. [possible trigger Warning] I find myself incapable of trusting my spouse. I have been with my SO for nearly 15 years, 7 married this year, we have 3 children. Before I hit my mid-teens I would been through nearly a decade of sexual abuse within the already dysfunctional household I grew up one, with an alcoholic father and a narcissistic mother. I met my now spouse when I was 17. He had been in a two year relationship with a girl a few years his senior, which left him broken after her infidelity. And I well I lived day to day, carrying what I could. I will never forgot how I coldly and factually told him with a mere two sentences what I had to endure, telling him that if he did chose me, he would be settling for a lifetime shared with a woman with severe ups and downs due to her limited mental strength. He convinced me to go for it and I wept in his arms. That was probably the first time in my life someone did not look the other way and I allowed myself to be vulnerable, instead of distant and cold. I opened myself up to him. Few years later my home situation imploded. I ran. His mother took me under her wing, I think she was the first parental figure I could lean on in my life. His father loathed me as the girl from the slums, threatening me in private to never marry his son. Reminding me of my lowly descent when he could. He would never come to accept me fully but at least fully respects me in public, which to me is commendable enough. Afterwards I started living with my now SO, still during our teens in a studio. The idea was triggered and pushed for by me as a solution after a bout of infidelity on his side after he moved to study in a city a couple hours away. He partook in intimate relations with a girl he knew from another country over webcam due to ''loneliness'' and held the act in the same regards as watching porn whereas I did not. We tried to work things out. As we did my view of him started to crumble, but was rebuilt after living together surprisingly worked remarkably well. We grew more towards each other and were best friends on top of lovers. In between this life changing chapter and where I am now, he has had a few strikes I simply can not forget. While I was once open to share my ups and downs and sadness with him, now I would rather not. Because where I once trusted him to hold me, I now trust him to ridicule me and tell me to man the fuck up. And the stubborn ass I am, I do, but this comes with resentment. But to explain the strikes: - One is where I was crying after having particularly bad and involuntary memories. Annoyed by my state and stressed by upcoming finals he asked me: When is this going to end? You are always spinning the same old tales, you are driving yourself insane. - Another was when he screamed out while we had visitors: How would you like it if I told everyone you were raped? He believed I had done something utterly despicable, blame was pinned upon me by one of his siblings. In that moment something broke, the attack was 100% unwarranted. So much trust lost. When he figured out I had done nothing to him the apologies came swift and numerous. - One was when I asked him for a letter. He will always buy flowers on special occasions, which I hate. They wither and die. I just hate the sentiment, I dislike it and I have communicated this. I wanted something which lasts. A reminder. All I wanted was a letter. Years I secretly yearned for one but received flowers instead, which I still tended to. Finally I asked for a letter. He refused and told me point blank to my face he would not. That it was silly I needed something to hold onto, and that this item would become something of an unhealthy obsession. - The latest strike was after I endured a panic attack while I was on my own, which I managed myself before he returned home. He was upset when I confided in him and he stated: I will not be on your side if you are mentally ill. I will choose our children and make sure they grow up with stability. (Later he corrected himself and stated that if I was to turn schizophrenic or manic, he would have me committed and divorce me, but would support me through depression and anxiety). Now to me a panic attack is something manageable if you are equipped to deal with it. Through the years I have learned to be aware of my surroundings and triggers and to be prepared to deal with anything since I am responsible for my children. I have no history of hysterical or erratic behavior, so I found his reaction to my first ever panic attack very crude. I have my pride even through my depression for what I have survived and what I have accomplished. But I hate that I can not find it in myself again to open up towards my spouse and more than often find myself crying when I am capable to, so I can put up my smile and brave face when I NEED to. I have successfully faked it till I made it. And of the 15 years that we have been together the good by far outweighs the bad, something which can not be conveyed well enough in this post. But what has been said can be never taken back. Even though recently he said: Do not you understand after 15 years I am on your side? I understand. I hate that I cannot be vulnerable anymore. I hate that the trust is gone, and the resentment grows. If anyone has advice or a similar story of lost trust, I would just love to hear and talk about it, if only to gain some perspective. Edit: formatting","[possible trigger Warning] I find myself incapable of trusting my spouse.
I have been with my SO for nearly 15 years, 7 married this year, we have 3 children.
He had been in a two year relationship with a girl a few years his senior, which left him broken after her infidelity.
I will never forgot how I coldly and factually told him with a mere two sentences what I had to endure, telling him that if he did chose me, he would be settling for a lifetime shared with a woman with severe ups and downs due to her limited mental strength.
Few years later my home situation imploded.
So much trust lost.
Finally I asked for a letter.

I have gone days without talking to anyone I just got out of a bad relationship recently. But I have a issue with dependancy. I let him dictate my entire life. I let him into my head to the point I feel brainwashed. I hate everyone. I do not trust anyone. I do not want to talk to anyone because I know he will get mad and be jealous. He is the closest and only person I have in my life and even though we broke up he wants us to remain best friends. We dated for 2 years and it was Rocky the entire time. But I let him get his hooks into me and I cannot get out. I am terrified to not have him in my life because then I will be truly alone. I do not talk to anyone else. I am 26 years old and I have 0 friends other then him. I am terrified of being alone. But he is seeing someone else now. She is 100 times better then me in every way. She is super model gorgeous and everything that me and him shared she has as well. I feel replaced. But I do not want to not be his friend and not have him in my life. I am terrified to lose him. I cling to the hope one day he will want me again. I have not talked to another person in over a week. and if he is busy with her I do not talk to anyone at all. I just lay on my couch staring at the wall and having a constant never ending panic attack. I have sever depression and severe anxiety that I take medicine for both. But they only make the feelings bearable and do not take them away completely. I do not sleep. I just want to throw myself at every fuck boy on dating apps just to have some kind of physical attention even if it is only sex. Even if I am not attracted to them. I do not care. I just want someone to love me. I want someone to hold me and make me feel not alone. I do not know what to do. I feel like I have been kicked in the chest. It hurts to breathe. I made a noose and stood on a stool with it around my neck for over a hour the other night crying. But I could not do it. I do not know how to go on living.,"I let him dictate my entire life.

"I am really new at this, and I am sure that all of you have your own problems, but i figure who better to ask then other people who might feel the same as i do. I just turned 15 and i have suffered from depression or what i am almost sure is depression for about 4 years now. I have tried telling my parents about it, and they just will not listen, they say that I am just going through normal teenage stuff, but if this is normal, then i would hate to see what depression is really like.

They also found pills that i had been taking and still did not do anything but ""talk"" to me about it. And my boyfriend, i know he loves me, and i want to tell him about my problem, but i just cannot, I am afraid that he may leave me because of it. and i know that would be all it would take to throw me over the edge and cause me to do something drastic!

"I was wondering what people is viewpoints are on for being on medication .. because it seems like getting the right combo of medications seem tricky and if you do not get the right combination, you still remained depressed .. or worse than before? I am curious to know what the myths .. vs non myths about antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, etc? Do they make you feel worse? They say that the medications generally make you feel more like yourself than different .. but it takes some 6 months to get attuned to them? Is that correct? I have been trying to fight off my depression for over 10 years - I think it is a factor from childhood abuse. In recent years, perhaps my nerves have grown thin .. and I am slowly wearing myself out .. my friends have recommended more therapy since I see a school counselor once every two weeks. But it is difficult to really focus on my emotion health when I know that I will be relocated in two months .. and I feel that my current emotional stability is just shaky.. Is it advisable to start medications without therapy and then when I relocate to wherever I find a job .. then begin therapy there? (In other words, I have never been on medications before) Any advice would be helpful.","Do they make you feel worse?

"Just a vent post I went grocery shopping with my mom. I manged to get on the topic of politics and I mentioned how it would be bad if people could start discriminating against someone because of their religious freedom. She told me it should be okay to do this (brought up the whole baker thing to prove her point) while saying this she told me she loved me, but did not like how I am gay (pansexual with some hints of genderfluid, though she does not know the last part) because it is a sin.

"I should be an actor.. I feel like most people who have depression could work in theatre or movies. I do not know how you guys feel about putting on an act when really you feel so sad that it is hard to breathe, but recently I have been having to act like I am getting better from depression. My roommate confided in me one day when I came back to our dorms that he struggles with depression. He was placed in a foster home after his parents died, and his foster mom committed suicide. After that, his friend also committed suicide, so of course this takes a toll on someones' emotional health. I told him that I started taking meds and going to therapy, and I smile and laugh and act like I am doing better so that he can feel encouraged to get help with his depression. I feel so fake though, even though I am getting help, I do not think it is helping me, my chest has that particular empty feeling and breathing is hard to do. I feel like crying a lot of the times now while I am laying down in bed, and driving to and from class. I would never let my roommate know that I was actually not doing better though.

I had skipped work today because this dream was too good to just let the alarm clock interrupt it. I have been able to hold onto my dreams a lot lately. Such as I can wake up and roll over and fall back asleep in the exact spot in the dream I left off.. Now the dream is I am at some party. The room is very lavish looking. And everyone there I know. Feels like this party was somehow for me. Never has ever happened. Now the part that stands out is that I see my teacher who was my mentor she was everything to me. When I was in high school I not only had this HUGE crush on her but she was the kind of actor I had always wanted to be except I was willing to die for my art. Still am. She is sitting with her two kids. They are probably the most gorgeous kids I have ever seen and she has not changed. Her husband is in the distance somewhere. I never see him but I am aware of him. I thank her for all her time and effort she put into me and I ask her how it is going with her life and if she is still teaching. We talk about something else and the dream slowly fades away. Reality is I have not heard from this teacher since I graduated. I heard she had a kid and she moved to vermont. I miss her terribly. Somehow this dream seems to have more than just one meaning. And since everyone else has dream threads I am going for one too.,"Now the dream is I am at some party.

"Lost my dad and my pet within the last two weeks. We took my dad to the hospital and found out he had a tumor in his colon.

Finally he was recovering and they told her she can go home since they are transferring him to a hospital closer to us. She comes home and the next morning we find out he died in his sleep from a heart attack. After surviving all the surgeries, he dies alone the same night my mom went home. On top of that, we did not get along well. I am not even sure he knew I cared about him. All the responsibilities fell on me since both my parents were gone for a month. I did not have time to drive to the hospital he was at. We had his memorial service and funeral.. then things started to calm down. My mom and I spent time making the house spotless and reorganizing. I woke up this morning to find out that the cat I have had for 6-7 years got hit by a car.

"I know I am depressed but I have no energy to do anything to counter it. I have been searching for a job for 4 months to no avail (I used to have an office job for 4 years before quitting it to take a leap of faith to migrate to another country), and from the second month onward, I have plunged deeper and deeper into depression. Back then in uni days, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and was put on medications. I have been off them since my graduation, because I did not want to depend on them for the rest of my life and I did not really have the funds to continue the treatment back then.

My biological clock is a total mess, in the morning I would just sleep in and refuse to wake up, even though it is already past noon. I tend to shy away from as much social interaction as possible; I just plainly do not want to meet anyone, it freaks me out and makes me uncomfortable. I even refuse to answer any emails or continue the dreary job searching and job application. I know that I am in a big mess. I disgust myself for my lack of energy and determination to do anything. But then when I am faced with the colossal task at hand, I would chicken out, then I would sleep on it, hoping that everything would somehow sort themselves out, only to find myself wake up in the next morning groggy and lethargic.

"Ca not fix anything in my life I am such a fundamentally broken person. I have want to say I have been fighting for years, but that'a not true. All I can do is fucking run away from everything until the day is over. No action I take to improve myself can ever have weight because I am so goddamn broken that when I try to do something to better myself, it just reminds me of how much of a fucking loser I am. I cannot handle the fucking *pain* that comes with self improvement. It is not fun in the least. It is humbling. Too humbling. And it just shoves in my face all the time I have wasted and all of the experiences I never had simply by virtue of being my self. Everyone who is happy acts like life is just some natural occurrence. Like things just happened to them and fell into place. This could not be further from the truth of my experience. Nothing ever just happens organically. Either I try hard and fail due to my lack of intelligence, or I do not do anything at all. It is hard to stay happy after constant failure and social rejection. I have never had interests or goals or relationships or friends. I never will. These thing do not just happen. You have to be a certain kind of person for them to happen. I am not that person. I will never be that person because I do not even know who I want to be, and if I figured that out I would be too insecure to become that. All I see in my future is homelessness and destitution because I came into adulthood with absolutely zero interests, special memories, or relevant/helpful past experiences. My memory of my life in general is so goddam hazy at this point, if I ever did have those things, they have long been gone to the abyss. I just think why. Why do I have to be so broken and dysfunctional among everyone else? I am not even a real person. I am a complete shell of what could have been a person. This is too difficult to come to terms with, while impossible to argue against. It is true. It is my reality. It honestly just makes me angry, bitter, and jealous of others, at a very deep, fundamental, human level, for what the healthy people have. I fantasize about taking two AR-15s and unloading on people. Maybe I know them, maybe I do not, it would not matter. Often lives completely lose their value when my headspace gets dark enough. Not as the result of an illness but of the fact that I am who I am both physically and psychologically. Blind rage. That is what the result of my dysfunction is. Pure fucking anger at both the world and myself. Unable to cope with my grim reality, all I want to do is destroy. The only thing I could ever really destroy is myself. The thought of my life slipping away becomes more attractive by the day as I see how impossible my desires are and how completely fruitless any effort to change is sure to be, just like it always has. I cannot handle the responsibility of being alive and I do not want to anymore.

I will never be that person because I do not even know who I want to be, and if I figured that out I would be too insecure to become that.
I am not even a real person.
I am a complete shell of what could have been a person.
The thought of my life slipping away becomes more attractive by the day as I see how impossible my desires are and how completely fruitless any effort to change is sure to be, just like it always has."
"Just some curious questions here. I am recently undergoing lots of stress in my life. My work is failing and I am struggling keeping up. I recently have a new born in the family as well and extra workload at home too. I noticed these few symptoms:1) Often worrying, going in a loop worrying even about small things 2) Very easily agitated, get angry very easy 3) Weird sleeping pattern, cannot sleep at night and sleep 10-12 hours straight during the day 4) Hard to concentrate at anything serious, easily distracted 5) Have up and down moments, sometimes it feels as though nothing has happened, sometimes it hits hard and I could waste one whole day just sitting at home being totally non productive. 6) Easily give up at everything I do, everything seems to be hopeless at times. I am putting off going to the doctors for a long time now. I previously been to the doctors and was given 2 different kind of antidepressants and I really felt awful taking them and stopped. I am reluctant going back because of the same reason. Is this a serious matter that warrants me to see the doctor again? Just hate the feeling but I noticed the ""downs"" have been coming on more and more lately due to more stress load. Please advice, and if possible give some advice concerning the medication I am most likely to be given if I go to the doctors as well..thank you.","I noticed these few symptoms:1) Often worrying, going in a loop worrying even about small things 2) Very easily agitated, get angry very easy 3) Weird sleeping pattern, cannot sleep at night and sleep 10-12 hours straight during the day 4) Hard to concentrate at anything serious, easily distracted 5) Have up and down moments, sometimes it feels as though nothing has happened, sometimes it hits hard and I could waste one whole day just sitting at home being totally non productive.

"going through life waiting for it all to end soon i got nothing going for me in my life. im 22 and never had a girlfriend. you know what, i never even had a friend..guy or girl. im tired of going to college and doing meaningless work and for what? so i can join the rat race? i dont want to grow old, it is only going to get worse as i age, especially healthwise. im totally awkward, cannot make conversation beause there is nothing interesting about me,and im really ugly..so that means no one would even bother taking an interest in me and approach me to really talk. like that would be one of the major reasons why i never even had a friend, not to mention a girlfriend! and im poor, so i dress stupid. it is the same thing every single day, i go to school, do not talk to anyone, and go home. i dont even have a job, and i dont drive. i just hope i go away soon, like get a terminal illness, that would make everything so much easier. i do not know, i am just rambling here. i cannot really describe everything in words here, you would have to be in my shoes to really get it, so to speak.","im 22 and never had a girlfriend.

"Today is gonna be tough I have been doing okay for a bit now and have not really been in a slump for a couple weeks but today I cannot help it. Been thinking all of last night about it and now I am pretty torn up. By no means am I a traditionally religious person. I believe in a god, Jesus died for our sins, and all that good stuff. But I do not walk around preaching and forcing what I believe onto others, instead I try and be humble. I am really struggling here with my depression here as I write this out on my lunch break at work. I do not know if I can make it through today. I just got to thinking last night and a few days before: at this point, is it faith or apathy? I just do not really care about anything anymore, not for a long time, many years, in fact. I have always run my life according to my faith. God will provide, God will meet me half way, be thankful for all that I have. I am not struggling with my faith or anything but why am I still around? What am I looking for? What am I waiting on? I am by no means struggling with my faith but rather where does the line cut off between having faith that things will turn out versus just not giving a shit about anything hoping things will turn out? I do not know, I guess I just want to lay down for awhile. Dream it all away. Pretend that life is not bearing down on me or that I am happy. I just want it to be over. All of it. Just take me home, wherever that be.","Today is gonna be tough I have been doing okay for a bit now and have not really been in a slump for a couple weeks but today I cannot help it.

No where feels like home. I remember thinking when I was younger: I just want to go home. Even though I would be in pajamas and in the house that I grew up in. I feel like I do not belong anywhere and I will never find my place. The future just seems very bleak as though nothing good will ever happen.,No where feels like home.
"I feel like nothing works or will work out, can someone relate? It is always like I try something and want to better myself, have high expectations and then life comes, uppercuts me, spits on me and just screams You thought, bitch. I had a really good therapist but she suddenly quit due to illness. I had to wait several months until I got the final answer. Had no therapy in that time between and also we only had like 6 sessions. Now I have a therapist who is ok but I just do not vibe with her that much. And I cannot change because of insurance. Nor do I have the money to pay for one myself since I am a broke ass student. I told her once that I do not want solutions. I want someone to genuienly understand me. At first she tried and now it is all solutions again. Try this, try that, we need to experiment. I get the thought but I feel like my deep down feelings are just irrelevant once again. My first therapist really understood me and listened. I could cry my heart out and afterwards I felt so much lighter. I really miss that feeling. Now it is just an obligation I have to do. Back then I never used to come late to my therapy sessions because I really looked forward to it. But now I am constantly running late because deep down, I just do not want to go anymore and give up. I do not have energy for that. I also took anti depressants (Tianeurax if anyone knows that one). At first it helped me, especially with processing feelings. But then I turned super suicidal and had mental breakdowns over mental breakdowns. I completly stopped and now I feel numb again. I want to feel suicidal and emotional again, to be honest. At least I processed something. Now I feel empty and dead inside once again, like how I used to be all the years before I started therapy and taking anti depressants. My new therapist asked me what I can bear more. My suicidal state or this passive suicidal state. I told her the last one. But honestly, I want it to be the first one. At least I felt like a human. At least some people cared because they were afraid I would do something to myself. Now no one cares. I am alone. I do not go outside anymore. I am just isolating myself again. No one really talks to me and I am just a bother to everyone. I honestly think about taking my anti depressants again, just to get suicidal and off myself. Despite often being a bad actor, I am just so well at playing this role of Of course, I will try! I will do my best. I am good at pretending nothing bother is me and everything is fine. I am good at pretending to say Wow, your advice helped me so much, thank you for listening!. But I am just a fraud. Nothing helps. Afterwards I just want to die more. Sometimes I ask myself, why the hell do I even put up with all of this. The only reason why I have not killed myself yet is because it would financially ruin my family. I do not even care about emotions, I doubt it would be that bad. No one likes me anyway. Just so they do not get into debt with my death or sth. I often find myself also thinking that I will never leave a goodbye letter or tell them goodbye. Because no one cares anyway. I told them many times before why I want to die. I do not feel like anyone deserves that anyway because they do not put as much energy into me as I put into them. Whenever I feel like it goes up, it just crumbles down. I really do not know how much of this I can take. I have been like this since 6 years old. I am 21 now. I do not know why I got thrown into this world when I am ridden and infested with mental illnesses.","I feel like nothing works or will work out, can someone relate?

"You do not have to read this, it is just a short story. A few years ago i was in love with a guy, we were in the same course at school. I got so nervous every time I saw him. However, he did not say a word to me. He ignored me. He did not even look at me. I did not want to ignore him, i tried to get his attention, but i just did not manage. It frustrated me. I just did not understand why he deliberately ignored me. I was so down, I started cutting again, did not eat for days, .. It lasted one year. The whole year he never said a word to me. Not even when my sister died. I do not understand it today and I never will. I never will forget the pain. However, i do not blame him for ignoring me. Everybody has the right to ignore me. But it hurts me so much. And today I always get the feeling people ignore me. And when people i care about do so, it is horrible. Maybe they do not deliberately ignore me, but i always think they do. For me it is the worst thing you can do to a person. It is worse than hating somebody. I wrote a poem for this guy, it is not good, but i want to share it. Do not blame me Do not blame me for thinking of you, because you just do not know how i feel You never knew me and you never will, but i know you so well, yes i do. Do not blame me for dreaming of you, because you just do not know how much it hurts You are so far away, but you are in my dreams, there i can reach you, yes i can. Do not blame me for searching for you because you do not know how much i miss you You never looked at me like i look at you, I need you, i always will Do not blame me for loving you, because you just do not know how i feel You never knew me and you never will, but i love you so much, yes i do.","He ignored me.

"the message i wasnt able to send him. Dear ex, today I found out all the truth. I saw you with her. Why have you been lying to me? Why do you tell me you would love me forever when you do not. Why did you lie to me that you are not talking to your ex when I know you have been.. when I saw a message that you sent her that said ""When I am with her I think about you"" that hurt me so much..I still forgave you. Why did you lie to me about her ""suddenly"" coming to see you when you already knew she was coming to see you? Why did not you tell me you were going to see her when you told me you were out with your friends? Why do I still forgive you even when you keep fucking up? Why do I love you so much that I did not mind if you do not love me as long as you were by my side? Why did you even tell me you would make it up to me and gain back my trust when you do not prove anything? Why do you keep telling me so much lies? When were you ever sincere to me? Was I a rebound? Are you happier with her now when you used to tell me she never made you happy? Did you get what you wanted now? Is that why you left me? Am I the only one dying here? While you enjoy yourself when we only broke up yesterday? Did I really meant nothing to you? When I thought you could love someone like me because I cannot even love myself. I depended on you and you destroyed me. I gave up everything for you. My dreams, my friends, my family, my time, my efforts, blood, sweat and tears for you. Maybe it is just my fault for not being good enough. Maybe I was not pretty enough for you? Maybe I was right.. she was irreplaceable after all. I knew it.. no one can love me.

Why promise me things that you could not keep? Why tell me that you love me when you never did.. I just hope that all the memories we had together, at least just one tiny part of it was sincere.

"I feel like culture is a big reason why a lot of people do not seek out professional help I do not know much about other cultures, but I live in a Hispanic/American household. I feel immigrants' families are typically a very work focused group. They expect you to just tough it out and push through everything . Most people in these communities do not see depression as an illness, but rather as an excuse for being lazy or unmotivated. There is almost a macho type mindset that you are not supposed to talk about those bad feelings and that shit really sucks. It is pretty much frowned upon to even consider looking for therapy because it is for crazies. I have been chronically depressed for years but I am finally going to seek professional help Monday. I have been having suicidal tendencies for years and if I ever have kids, which I very much hope I do one day, I will be damned if they feel they cannot come to me to talk about any bad thoughts.","I feel like culture is a big reason why a lot of people do not seek out professional help I do not know much about other cultures, but I live in a Hispanic/American household."

"I do not know what to do with myself anymore. Last year, I met a wonderful friend online. We began dating in February of 2017 and have been inseparable ever since. However, we both have mental illnesses, for me I have PTSD and depression, and for him ADHD and depression. He is being treated for both, I am untreated because of my family and our financial situation. I am afraid I am frustrating him. I feel like I am dragging him down. He is tried to get me to take better care of myself, but it is hard, seeing as we are long distance and I always slip back into my bad habits. I feel like I pissed him off tonight and I never understood why he got frustrated, but now I think I do. No matter what, I did not really listen or heed his advice, and I am afraid because of that he is going to decide that I am unmanageable and he will leave me. I am terrified I am going to make him resent me. I am at my wit is end, he is my best friend and I am very in love with him, but I just do not know how to be better for him.

"Feeling Good is an excellent book. I have re-read a few times when I have felt the need. If you are looking at something for anxiety and panic, I suggest Mastering Anxiety and Panic revision II (map-3) by David Barlow. I suffered from anxiety, panic attacks and agoraphobia from the time I was 12 until last year..that is 30 years. Nothing had ever helped until I found a therapist that uses that program. A different way of looking at things and I have to say that I worked miracles for me. I am driving, flying, going to concerts, sporting events..things I have not done for over 20 years. I NEVER thought I could get better and only went because my boyfriend of 8 years was honest with me and told me that he did not know if he could spend the rest of his life going every place alone. That was a wake up call for me and to my surprise, I found that I COULD do it. I still have my depression and I am endlessly working on being medicated correctly for that.. all of you know how that is. You can buy just the workbook .com (Oxford University Press). Well worth the money.","I suffered from anxiety, panic attacks and agoraphobia from the time I was 12 until last year..that is 30 years.

"When people surrounding you keep thinking that you are trying to act cool over your mental illness. I am depressed. And those people around me always think that I am just trying to act deeply, or being cool. They ask me to become normal but I still do not get what kind of normal that they mean.

I know we have one life and that there is nothing after that but that fact is not motivating. In many moments like this I am convinced that this is all life is and can be and the repetitive, short range, unchanging emotions is my proof. Feels completely pointless and childish to even vent, me writing this feels ridiculous.","As much as I would like to say it does not define me, it really does, it controls my life enough to debilitate my every day experiences."
"I had my second appointment with my naturopathic doctor today. I am getting this feeling that she is really just a therapist for people who do not want to go to a therapist. She lets me ramble on about all sorts of things that have very little to do with my health. Like what our rules for Jeffrey and food are. Last time she gave me a series of homeopathic remedies (Undas) to support my liver. This time it was a capsule called Ichol. I am not sure if these things do anything more than lighten my wallet, but I am willing to try them for now. I do desperately need to lose weight and if there is any chance that these things will help, I am willing to go for it for a while. I have been searching the net reading about Katirina and other personal tragedies that bloggers are going through and I am sort of jealous. My life is just full of 'normal' stuff right now. My grandpa died in August and we went to his funeral but it does not affect my life in a large way. Just in the morally rehensible way that now I do not have to feel guilty about not going to see him. It is not that I did not want to see him, I just never found the time and now I do not have to worry about it. At some level I am sure that means that I am headed to eternal damnation. In other news, we have managed to find a geo-cache. It took us three trips to the spot because dusk is not the time to find dark colored boxes hidden in an unlit forest. Even if it is just 2 kilometers southwest of our house on a really nice nature trail.","I am not sure if these things do anything more than lighten my wallet, but I am willing to try them for now.

"i am a 16 year old. i think i am depressed, but i do not know how to tell. um..it is like i am afraid to tell my parents because i know them, they will brush it off as no big deal or make me sit down and tell them what is going on. Did they ever think that i do not want to talk to them? My mother is like a roller coaster ride you cannot wait to get off of. One day she could care less that i am sick, or that i need to tell her something, and then the next day she is all, talk to me, tell me what is going on. God it can be so annoying. i know that i have a problem with my emotions, i just cannot seem to control them, when i am upset, stressed, angry, sad. There are always three things that i do. First i cry, then i scream, then i run to my room, and sometimes i might knock something down. And that gets me another, what is going on talk. Two years ago my grandma died. We were not that close and i think that is part of my problem. every time i try to go to sleep i just lay there and think about my life, and realize, there is not that one person, you know, everyone has one, that one person that you can just call up and say, ""hey, i am in a bad mood, can you talk.."" or ""hey i just got in another stupid fight with my mom, do you have time to talk to me.."" and maybe that is what is wrong with me, i do not have someone to vent to so i keep it all inside. i mean i try and find ways to let my anger and frustration out like, i am a poet, sort of. Everyone tells me i am at least, but what they do not seem to understand is that maybe i am a good poet because i have nowhere else to let all of this out. No one can see that, no one can see that i need someone to talk to. i try and talk to my mom, but she is so busy, and that is not her fault, it is not like she is ignoring me on purpose, she has school, she has work, she has my brother is wrestling match, she has a meeting. then i try and talk to my friends, and i know that they would listen and they would try and understand, but i do not know, i just do not feel as though they need all of my crap on their shoulders, not that you do either, who ever is still reading this. i guess it is that sometimes, i feel ignored. i turned sixteen this year. Happy Sweet Sixteen..right? i wanted to have a party, i wanted to go out and have a good time. But that did not exactly work out the way i had planned. At first i thought that my friends had forgotten about me, no call on my birthday, no card. And then they threw me a surprise party, nothing big and fancy, just small, just the four of us, the way we like it, but still it felt weird, it just did not feel right. i am supposed to be driving, i have my temporary permit, i have had them since October, you know how much i have driven, about one hour. i could have gotten my license last month, but i cannot go to driving school until i get more experience, and i cannot get more experience until one of my parents decides to let me drive. They used to take my brother out all the time, they would let him drive everywhere. i do not know, i just feel like sometimes being the middle child and the only girl i get ignored. i am a cutter. i tried to tell my parents three times that i was a cutter and i wanted to stop. i could not tell them in words so i wrote them a letter, they never read it. you probably think i am some selfish person, but i just have been holding all of this inside of me for three months now and there is more down inside of me, i just need to slowly let it out. Sorry if this took up to much of your time. Thank you for listening to me..it feels nice to know that maybe there is someone out there listening.","i think i am depressed, but i do not know how to tell.

"I do not want to exist anymore My girlfriend has left me a couple of months ago, saying she does not love me anymore but without explaining me why. I then tried to ask her out one last time, not to come back together, just to clarify what happened. She does not want to see me and when I write to her she answers back just so that I cannot say she is ignoring me and she continuously provokes me to get into an argument. I really had trusted her, and she had done the same, until a couple of months ago (she is always told me I was the only person who she actually trusted, even after we split up) so I feel like I have been used and then thrown away like an object. I then realized I am not good at all at socializing, that she was the only truly important person in my life (except for other two friends of mine, who have their own lives and whom I do not want to annoy too much with my problems) and that I will probably never know anyone else in my life. Every day I feel like I am bothering other people and I am not doing anything good, and probably this is the reason nobody wants to become my friend. I do not want to commit suicide, but often I find myself thinking how better it would be if I stopped existing..","I do not want to exist anymore My girlfriend has left me a couple of months ago, saying she does not love me anymore but without explaining me why."
"A rant, I guess I had to come off of my antidepressants for medical testing. I am finally off of them and I cannot take this. I did not think they were working and I definitely was not where I wanted to be when I was at my maximum dose, but oh my God. I started them for anxiety mostly so I am surprised that I am relapsing so hard into depression. I just wish I did not exist-- eh, better yet I wish I did not have to participate in every day life. I do not know what to do. I used to have so much motivation to finish my college work and now I have none. I have finals that start tomorrow that I have not studied for at all. Like, not even a little. And somehow I do not care. That is just not like me. I am exhausted from putting so much effort in all the time. I exhausted from being stressed all the time. I do not want to keep doing this. I just want to sleep. And to think I have four more years ahead of me. I do not know what I am going to do. I already feel like a failure. I keep thinking that maybe I could find something to take my mind off things but I have no hobbies. I do not enjoy anything any more. Not even eating, which I used to love probably too much but hey. I want to lie in my floor and watch the days pass by me. I do not want to have to keep trying. Another thing is everything and everyone irritates the living hell out of me now. The smallest thing sends me over the edge into my spiral. Three weeks ago if I spilled my coffee I would have laughed it off. It happened the other day and I cried for hours and was so angry. Three weeks ago I was better than this. And I am crashing all of a sudden. I do not know how I am going to study for my finals and maintain my GPA to keep my scholarships. I am fucked probably. My therapist is not that great and I have not seen her in awhile and I do not have money to go back to her. My psych appointment is not until late January, after my medical procedure.

"I am Mark, this is my first post on here. I am feeling really scared of myself at the moment, I have been depressed to some extent for as long as i can remember, and have had many hospital admissions in the past, but for the past few years life has been manageable, I have been in a relationship, not a very good relationship but one that helped me feel safe, i stopped overdosing and cutting, the relationship as i said had its downsides i am not sure love is the word to describe what we had but it was a strong feeling whatever it was, and now that we are no longer together i realize that whatever we had was stronger than anything i had before. i am so lonely and have very scary thoughts, you see my partner has moved back to his home country as he had no choice he was living here illegally, the days we were together before he left i started to have very disturbing thoughts, i even thought of killing him as it would be easier than living without him!! that is very scary. now that he is gone all the old feelings i used to have about myself and the hatred i have for myself is showing again, he was my protector, my distraction i suppose. but now i do not have that i feel it is only a matter of time until i do some thing really stupid. i have not acted yet as i do not what to have a 'failed' attempt, i am not sure i want help, that is why i am looking here first maybe after this rant i will understand what is happening a bit more, maybe not. all i know at this point is i would rather not be alive, not sure i want to kill myself but i do not want to be alive, do not know if that makes sense","I am feeling really scared of myself at the moment, I have been depressed to some extent for as long as i can remember, and have had many hospital admissions in the past, but for the past few years life has been manageable, I have been in a relationship, not a very good relationship but one that helped me feel safe, i stopped overdosing and cutting, the relationship as i said had its downsides i am not sure love is the word to describe what we had but it was a strong feeling whatever it was, and now that we are no longer together i realize that whatever we had was stronger than anything i had before."
"I am so mad at myself. Angry more like it. I truly hate myself right now. My wife and I are currently separated, and it is all my fault. I know, I know, wouldo not blame yourself'. Well, the truth is that it is all my fault this time. I did some pretty terrible things to my wife and family to make them leave. I also opened my mouth when I should have just kept it shut. I said some pretty stupid things over the past year plus. I had become some sort of monster, and did not know what to do. When it got found out about, I told my wife that I wanted her to take the kids and get away from me. Why did I do that? I love my wife very much, and do not want to lose her. I just do not know how to express that to her. I am so angry that I just want to hurt myself. I do not care how or what happens. I want things to go back to the way they were before I started having my problems. I just want to shout and hit something or someone. I wish someone could help me. I am seeing a therapist, but I do not know if it is helping. My mind is still a jumbled up mess. My life is even worse, and I do not know what to do to make it better. I feel so down and out of it.

"This sub is useless I do not want to appear pessimistic or a negative person, but I do really believe this sub is useless.

Did I feel better after I realized other people are suffering with me? No. Maybe if I told a friend, to my brother that I am feeling like shit, maybe, I would feel better,but to unknown people on the internet? What they tell me is worthless. I do not need to feel comforted or understood, I need help from people and receiving advices on how I can improve my life or stories of people feeling better. Something which is really lacking on this sub. I want to feel better and I do not care about intellectualizing my pain or feel comforted.

"There is a genetic weakness in my family - virtually everyone has been on medications at some time, or is on medications now, for depression and anxiety disorders. It seems to onset around puberty. I have had a truly horrible time over the last 3 years supporting my depressed daughter (now aged 15) and, more recently, my 22 year old son. I have been taking 340 mg of St John is Wort once a day for about a year, but I am aware that the genes are kicking in, and I am now quite ill in my own right. I really do not want to take prescription medications, as I have seen the horrible side effects that my daughter and son have experienced as the medications have kicked in - she has had to change medications once as she reacted so badly. Just from looking at the size of the St John is Wort pills available, it is obvious that I could take a much higher dose. Does anyone know anything about dosage, and whether it would be better to take doses throughout the day rather than just once? Incidentally, Valerian Root is great for sleeplessness - if you can stand the smell!","I have been taking 340 mg of St John is Wort once a day for about a year, but I am aware that the genes are kicking in, and I am now quite ill in my own right."

"I went to College for Political Science. Now I cannot stand politics. When I started college in 2012, my goal was to join the foreign service to represent my country to people abroad. I loathe Trump and all he stands for. My grandmother lost every single relative in Europe to the Nazis, and two days after the election I saw another student at the University come in wearing an SS logo. And with Nazis marching every month I am am ashamed to be American. I have been running behind in college for a while, but as long as I had serving my country to look forward to I kept going. At this point though I would rather be dead than associated with this country. I cannot even avoid the toxicity of politics because that is what my degree is in. I spent the last year trying as hard as I could to think of any reason to keep going. I cannot find one. I wrote my first suicide note last month all about my feeling of meaninglessness in a country that killed the country I loved. While I wallowed in self loathing, I have costed my mother so much money. Once my sister started college she had to cash out her 401k to keep us both in college because I did not get a scholarship and did not graduate. I would get a job, but I do not have a driver is license and public transportation does not go by my house. When I drop out of school my student loans will come due, and if I cannot pay them my family will try. The only way out I can think of is death. My student loans are of a type that are forgiven if I die, so my family would save more by just paying to have me buried than to pay off my debt.","I went to College for Political Science.

"Looking for an opinion So I have been angry for awhile now, and I feel like my anger is unjustified.

She has a significant other. Soon after, she would not talk to me at all, and she avoided me. All of her friends told me that I should not have done that because it was a bad thing to do. I just wanted to tell her that I wanted some space from her, so I could no longer have feelings for her. Since then, all of her friends, have treated me with aggression and insults. I get dismissed every time I am around her and all of her friends. This has launched me into another Depressive episode. I was yelled at by other people and ostracized.

"I have now had BAD night sweats on and off for about 4 years. I am only 32, so it is not menopause and at this point I am pretty sure they are from my antidepressants. I have now tried about 4 - 5 different antidepressants to try to get rid of them but nothing has worked. About 4 years ago I got night sweats when I tried Zoloft which is known for causing them, so I switched to Prozac which never caused them and I was fine, for awhile. Then one day I just started getting night sweats and over the years I tried to get rid of them by switching to Wellbutrin, Effexor, Serzone (I think) and Cymbalta to no avail. My night sweats get worse depending on the season and humidity. At their worst, which as been for the past 2 weeks since the weather change, I am soaked all night, clothing, sheets, pillows, blankets - everything. Then I freeze when I get up to change my clothes or go to the bathroom because I am soaking wet. I am basically at the end of my rope. I no longer know what to do and my doctor is just choked it up to my antidepressants so they say there is nothing I can do. Has anybody gone through this and found a solution?

Neither of us received any notice that my benefits were about to expire.

"It is been a while since I have written and I decided to start off again with a bit of a bang. I am going to post my story of beginning recovery, this is to try and cheer some people up and to let them know that they could do it too. Well now, where to start.. About a year and a half ago (the beginning of Grade 8) is when I started to notice the changes. Not physical but emotional. I had been told many times that this was very normal for teenagers so I thought nothing of it. There was an incident with a rather immature and nasty young man, who I just happened to have an ENORMOUS crush on. Anyway we both kind of lead each other on for a while but nothing happened, than he meet this girl at a hockey game. He immediately started talking about her all the time and how he really loved her so much. I began to feel more and more useless. After that I started rolling down hill like a circle of cheese, and by March of that year I was quite close to suicide at several occasions. This is when I started noticing that this might not be normal and tried many self-help methods, all of which failed. I thought Grade 9 could be a new beginning, it was not. My grades were starting to slip and I just could not be happy anymore. Finally after a close call in December I told my mum all about my failed attempts and how I was feeling. She agreed to get me a new doctor. I visited her and I got diagnosed with depression and was prescribed Cipralex. Of course that took a while to work too which involved me missing a lot of school, falling really far behind, and having several more close calls. Finally I started feeling a little better and was even stable enough to start going back to school and going to visit my family in the East. Well I just got back from that trip and I have never felt better. I am ready to face the world. That trip was just what I needed. When I get through these next weeks until my birthday all I can see is a varely clear path ahead! For the first time in a year and a half I can concentrate and tolerate less than perfect circumstances. I hope everyone here will feel this way, you can if you just push through! Power to us! Rock on!","Well now, where to start..

"Does anyone else get very irritable whenever you are hungry? The biggest problem in my life is that I get extremely irritable when I am hungry. I will find myself fantasizing about getting in argument or getting mad about something and then kinda snap out of it and realize I am actually just hungry. Then I get something to eat and I can feel some of the stress melting away, taking deep breaths and shit. This happens every day. This makes me pretty cranky while I am making something to eat in the kitchen. If anyone tries to talk to me I just want nothing to do with them until I get some food in me. It is putting a real strain on some of my relationships. I am struggling with this because it is really hard to balance not overeating with not being irritable. I do not really know whats going on.","Does anyone else get very irritable whenever you are hungry?

"Seeing doctor this week to talk about my depressive symptoms. Is it bad if I ask to be put on AD is? I have had some symptoms of depression for awhile (no motivation, always tired, mood changes, sadness, etc.). I have been pretty reluctant to bring it up but finally decided I should see someone to try and break the cycle. I would like to try being put on antidepressants and see if that helps me get back to feeling better about everyday life.","I have had some symptoms of depression for awhile (no motivation, always tired, mood changes, sadness, etc.)."
"No friends whatsoever. Living in isolation. Please help me I am in my final semester of undergrad. I am 24. I live in a university apartment. I have severe social anxiety. I have gone through therapy before, stopped for a while, and am now trying to find a new therapist that takes my insurance. Every day is almost total isolation. I go to class. I fantasize about working up the courage to talk to someone or say something in class but never do. I go back to my apartment. My randomly assigned roommates, all several years younger than me, keep to themselves. I am too afraid to talk to them. So I hole up in my small room and play video games or do homework. Day in. Day out. Rinse. Repeat. This has been my life for several years now. I am incredibly insecure. I have some combination of body dysmorphia and an eating disorder. I am probably quite good looking but I have never been in a relationship; I am still a kissless virgin. This eats me alive and makes me afraid to talk to women. Another reason to isolate further. I am losing touch with reality. I have loving parents but their advice is not particularly helpful. What I want is a friend, someone to talk to--but the anxiety gets in the way. I can talk to people in a structured setting, like therapy, or online (and easily and freely at that). But it is the act of doing it in the real world, in a natural setting, that is just impossible. I fantasize a lot about killing myself though I do not think I could ever actually carry it out. If someone could just be there for me I would feel better. But I have given up almost all hope.","Every day is almost total isolation.

"I have such a strong urge to just pick my stuff and leave at the moment that it is not even funny. I really, really just want to grab a bus ticket and get out of here. I suppose there are a lot of reasons, but one in particular. This is going to get a little creepy and it involves incest, so please do not read any further if you are just going to flame me. My brother has an attraction to me which really creeps me out. He is all the time running around the house naked, hitting on me, 'helping' me adjust my dresses so his hands can slide dangerously near my chest. It really, really disturbs me. My problem is that he asked me if it was all right if he hung around naked and stuff when I was drunk. I told him yes because I did not have my mind about me. Now I cannot think of how to tell him that it makes me uncomfortable and that I do not want him doing it anymore. Along with that I just lost my best friend due to depression. I have been trapped in my house for two weeks and I have not seen my mom, dad, brother, or sister for more than five minutes in this entire time. I just want to run away from it all. I do not want to kill myself, but I do want to pack and go and just get away from this wretched town. Would it be such a bad thing to leave? I know it would be running from my problems, but maybe I could find easier problems to deal with somewhere else.","He is all the time running around the house naked, hitting on me, 'helping' me adjust my dresses so his hands can slide dangerously near my chest.

"Hello I am 25 from the UK, I have suffered from depression I would say most of my life, but have only been on medicines (20mg of Prozac) for just over 2 years on and off, I have had times off the medicines and relapsed back into depression and the last time I saw my doctor he said It would be better for me to stay on antidepressants long term. The Prozac is working for me at the moment However I find the medicines interrupt my sleep and I wake 3 or 4 times a night and the sleep I do get is very light and ""dreamy"" sleep, plus I seem to be a bit lightheaded and reckless, on my motorbike for example I do stupid things like speeding and other dangerous stuff (to myself not others), which before off the medicines I would never do because I was very paranoid and cautious. I was off Prozac for a while late last year and things went down hill fast, I was cutting my arms and wanted to kill myself, I felt I had no reason to live, I was drinking to relive the depression, and I was drinking about 10 to 12 cans of lager(or 3 bottles of wine) a night, thinking about it I was wrecking my liver and feeling even more depressed in the morning, plus I was putting on loads of weight with all the beers, which was another reason to make me feel like crap. After New Year I made the decision (with my doctor) to go back on the antidepressants, and cut the booze almost out (I still drink about 1 or 2 a night but that is all) because things could not get any worse. I feel a lot better, I am back in the gym and getting back into shape, and my job is going well, I am in a recovery stage at the moment, I just hope I do not f--k it up again like before. Anyway I hope everybody on here is ok.

"It goes by a few names .. a spiritual eclipse .. the black hole .. the shadow .. my own prison .. the downward spiral. I have named it a lot of different things .. like it has a life of its own. In a way it does .. my life. For too long and too completely. It is getting better but at times it seemed it could not be much worse .. unless I did the unthinkable .. at least most of the time it is unthinkable. Divorced for a little over a year know .. removed from a wife I came to realize was a classic borderline personality (look it up) .. I never realized how far down I was on the ladder of life and spirit until I got away from the witch / queen. A true chameleon who changed and kept me guessing and off balance for 18 years .. never knowing who to expect. Finally starting to figure it out .. I think. Two DWI is since the split in rapid succession and then finding out I was self medicating without realizing it. No license for the last 10 months (2 to go) and recovering emotionally and financially with Mom and Dad. Thank God someone cares. Two children I had to leave with the Queen of misery because of the threat of false allegations against me if I dared to go for custody. Hungry and lonely for someone to just be nice to me and care about me .. at least a little bit .. I find myself in my own prison having to acknowledge the fact ""Why would anyone want to have anything to do with me?"" Hard to accept, but the truth .. too much baggage .. my ex is baggage she handed off to me to spare herself her own truth. At times I wished I could just flip a switch and just go away. Times I thought about driving into a bridge abutment or into a truck at the last second. Absolutely crazy stuff. I can now see what was so logical at that time to be so desperate from too much pain suffered by the abuser she was. I can now see the so called glimmer or hint of a silver lining in the most simple of things life offers to everyone each and everyday. Thank God .. finally. Things will get better and hopefully someday great. I keep trying remind myself things could be a lot worse. Two great healthy kids who love me and miss me terribly. I am their entire world. I now realize that. That alone has kept me ""here"". Realizing now that I have been lost in that vortex of hell tugging at me for years .. I actually want to keep going on to life is next challenge.

I get a bit of Seasonal Affective Disorder, and even sun showers have not cheered me up.

"I do not particularly want to go into details about how I have been feeling the past couple of years, only because it is too much for me to go into, and I do not want to leave out important details or anything. In September 2005, I voluntarily admitted myself to the hospital is psych ward through my psychiatrist, the reason being because my depression had grown so severe that my muscles gave out and I could not move anymore, and my will to live had vanished entirely, I stopped eating, I was dehydrated, I stopped going to school, all I did was lay in bed all day, it is the only thing I could do. The decision to go to the hospital turned out to be a very, very big mistake, and I regret making that choice. I felt no connection with the other kids there, especially because I was a week away from turning eighteen, and most of them were thirteen, fourteen, and maybe one or two sixteen year olds. We were similar in an emotional aspect, but otherwise I could not relate to any of them. I just bored them, and the way they talked and the things they talked about just confused me. I did get involved with them to an extent during the last couple of days there, but I regret that now. This is a story in itself, but I also got involved with a girl there. She fell in love with me, and so did I fall in love with her, briefly. Only because a girl had never shown any attraction to me before, nor did a girl ever show any interest in me like she did. My feelings for her quickly faded after talking to her a couple of times outside the hospital. She turned out to be a real mess of a person. I did not suffer from the relationship, though. I do not talk to her anymore, and I actually became a better person because of it - I was enlightened. My depression practically disappeared following my discharge from the hospital. I do not know if it was because of the Zoloft that I had begun taking, or because I was finally free from that prison. By the way, I do have a form of claustrophobia. I am not particularly afraid of being in narrow or tight spaces.. I am afraid of being locked in narrow or tight spaces. And the hospital was very small, and they did not let you leave or go where you wanted. You were confined to your room, the main recreation room, and the hallway connecting those two places. The day before I was discharged, I was constantly shaking, sweating, and going to the bathroom. I could not sleep, and I was afraid to move. I had to stay in my room most of the time and skip out on the group sessions. So anyway, even though I felt better right after getting out of the hospital, that quickly, VERY quickly changed. By mid-late October, I was on home-schooling (and will be until I graduate in June this year, I am a Senior in High School), and attending group therapy several days a week, as well as seeing a psychologist once a week and a psychiatrist every several weeks. All of this therapy did NOT help me. I was feeling extremely depressed and suicidal one night, after a brief fight with my dad (I accidentally bumped the curb while parking, he yelled at me to watch the curb, and I got very upset, pulled the parking break, and walked off while screaming about slitting my throat..), and called one of the therapists at my group therapy to help me. I would locked myself in a room in my grandmother is basement, and I had called her so she could talk with me and help me to relax. Instead, she threatened to call the police if I did not open the door and let my dad in. So I opened it, but after that I completely lost my trust in her and could not stand being around her anymore. Another counselor at the group therapy also lost my trust. I felt a connection with him, and trusted him a lot, so I told him about my girlfriend (whom I had met online - another story) and he kept on accusing me of things.. like using her for sex, or not really being in love, and etcetera. So after having lost trust in two therapists, and then all sorts of insurance problems came up. I stopped going. A few weeks ago, I stopped going to my psychologist as well. I felt like I was being lectured by him instead of actually helped.. On top of that, he was taking weekly co-pay from me while he knew my insurance did not require co-pay for anything psychological! (i.e. Counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc.) And he still owes me a couple hundred bucks. He also charged my insurance for appointments I had cancelled. Basically, I took two steps forward, and then three steps back. My depression is not as bad as it was in September 2004, but I am pretty much tired of living. I am constantly thinking of suicide, and have even written brief suicide notes and made plans (which I never carried out). My Zoloft has been at 150mg for the past couple of months. It is helped my social anxiety slightly, but my depression - no. I am aware of the state that I am in, and I am simply tired of it. My future is all dark, I do not see things getting better. When I spoke with my girlfriend this weekend, I cried the entire night.. I just could not take everything anymore. I saw a new psychologist last week, but again, I feel like I am being lectured. I am eighteen years old, and being talked to as if I were twelve. It is insulting and makes me feel even more left out of things than I already do. I do not know.","I do not particularly want to go into details about how I have been feeling the past couple of years, only because it is too much for me to go into, and I do not want to leave out important details or anything.

"Advice for making it through school In my second year of college my mental health went down drastically and I lost all of my motivation and basically most of my ability to function. I could not do any schoolwork without panicking and crying because I did not think I could do it. I was scared of everything. During finals, my cat died and I just sorta gave up. I failed everything and took a year off. My family was so disappointed and treated me so differently for the year that I was out. About a month and a half before the fall semester of 2017, I got on a new medication and decided to felt good enough to go back to school. I knew I had no other option anyway. I did surprisingly well that semester but now that break is over, I am finding myself just as terrified as I was that semester I failed. I do not know what happened and I do not know how to get back to functioning again. I cannot drop out again. Why do I feel so low after having such a strong start? I really thought things were getting better but I feel like I am being taken over by this again. If anyone else has any advice for getting through it and regaining faith in myself I would love to hear it.","Advice for making it through school In my second year of college my mental health went down drastically and I lost all of my motivation and basically most of my ability to function.

"Dear depression, please please let me be. I know I can do so much good and actually get somewhere in life but you are constantly holding me down, suffocating me. Once I think I have escaped your grip you show me you never let go and I am reminded of how tightly we are woven together. I cannot breathe. I cannot eat. I cannot sleep. all I want is some peace. you creep into my bedroom at night when you know I am alone. you destroy everything inside me until I am just a hollow shell of a small sad girl. why?! why cannot you let me be? let me succeed? you bring fear, doubt, guilt, all the bad thoughts. I run and fight for the little bit of light I see through my window in the morning. but every night you are back. sometimes you do not even leave and it can be days, weeks, months til I get another chance at seeing the light. This is not living, this is not a life i wish my son is to see in me. You have taken me from myself. it is not fair. I just want to be free of your poison.

"My twenty year old sister died instantly in a car accident in march of 2005. It has been almost a year, and i have never had a dream about her, until tonight. In the dream, she goes from one family member to another, asking why we are ignoring her. She is extremely upset, and screaming that she does not understand. She sees me, starts toward me; and then i wake up. The overall sensation of the dream is that she stayed behind to take care of her fifteen month old daughter, and to give birth to the son she was pregnant with when she died. The strongest thing i picked up from the dream was the sensation that she does not know she is dead. Is there any meaning behind this dream? Am I losing my mind?","It has been almost a year, and i have never had a dream about her, until tonight."
"I am a 17 year old female from Ontario. When I was 12, my mom is boyfriend at the time raped me for six months every time I was there. When my dad finally got wind of the situation, my mom is boyfriend was taken to court and charged with molestation. I did not attend the trial. I recently found out that molestation is only ""unwanted touching"" as my friend told me, and would not have included most of what happened. I recently asked my mom what was brought up in court, and it was only 6 counts of molestation, meaning, they only knew of 6 different times where he had touched me and included nothing of what I went through. I now suffer from ptsd. due to it. I have never spoken to anyone about it before. I do not know how to deal with the sense of loss I feel about the situation. I now cut because of it and have terrible nightmares. I avoid being in most relationships because I do not want to tell my lover that I am not a virgin for them because I do not want to talk about what happened because I am afraid that that will ruin our relationship.

"When I was 16 I was raped by my boyfriend. I was a virgin at the time and it was really hard to accept that this had happened to me. I thought that somehow if I did not say anything to anyone or raise a fuss about it it was not true. But it only made it worse. When I tried to break up with him he tried to kill me. We worked together and that made it really difficult to avoid him. He told all his friends at work that I had ""given it up to him"" which was not true. I was mocked and teased by the people that i felt had grown to be my family. Now, five years later it is still something that hangs tightly in my mind and heart. It is very hard for me to trust anyone and good relationships have been few. I still look over my shoulder thinking he is going to be there again, following me, stalking me, preying on me.","I was a virgin at the time and it was really hard to accept that this had happened to me.

"Hi, I am new here and do not know where to start, where to post or anything. I do not know what can help me, but I know that I do not like my self, and I am unhappy most of the time. I am not currently on any medicines ( cannot even do that right) and have never really been tested or diagnosed with anything other than depression. I live my life day dreaming of what could be and what should be..I am a 38 year old female and my problems started when I was born. I was born to an alcoholic dad whom I loved and a mom who did the best she could whom I love as well. My whole family was in therapy from about the time I was 4 years old. Our family therapist/doctor was Dr. Love, I am not kidding that was his real name. All kinds of things were going on in my family that I was not aware of until I was grown. One was the fact that my real father was sexually molesting my older half sister..I was labeled a ""bad child"" ""out of control child"" and was locked in my room for hours at the time which was what our doctor told them to do..I would not cry when I was punished or spanked and my mom would have to stop my dad from whipping me to keep him from killing me I suppose. I was the youngest of 4 children, 1 real sister 1 half sister and one half brother. Although after I was grown I found out that my real sister was only half too.. I was very creative in a strange kind of way while I was locked in my room. I would open my window a scream for help with my tape recorder on, so when I got tired I could play it back so maybe someone would come..we had big metal blinds in the windows and for some reason I would raise the blind all the way up and tie the string to my door knob when I would go to sleep at night so the blind would fall if anyone opened my door.. Crazy huh?? Any way, when I was about 11 years old I was put in a foster home, you know cause I was a bad child. Then I went to group homes, back and fourth here and yonder. Never tested for anything..never medicated..I was back and fourth from home, foster homes, group homes and mental hospital from the age 11 to 16. During one of the times I was gone my parents divorced, and my mom moved to a new house. I had met a guy during one of my short stays home, and thought that he was my world. You know by then I thought no one loved me, except for him. He was my world. My oldest sister told me that if we got married I could not be sent away any more. She knew how it was being at those places in the 70 is and 80 is..I mean if you were not already ""mad"" you would be..So I married the only person in the world that I thought loved me..As soon as we were married, I got pregnant. He cheated on me, controlled me, I could not even go outside without him beating me. He would come in from his girlfriend is house and if I said anything about it, he would go off and throw things and call me every name in the book, take aerosol spray cans and a lighter and throw flames at me until I was in the corner begging and crying for him to stop. He beat me in my stomach and said he hoped I lost the baby. He said if I ever left him he would kill me. I had to get stitches over my eye where he busted it. Of course I lied to the doctor..scared for my life. All of this went on for a year, when my daughter was born he was not even there. His parents had to go get him out of his girlfriends bed..I was young and dumb. I thought that everything would get better now, I mean he was the only one in the world that ""loved"" me. Things got worse and when my daughter was weeks old he got in one of his moods and was beating on me and his grandma. That is who we lived with. He went out in the yard and took an axe to all the cars and his dad came over to stop him. My husband took the baby out of my arms and held her over his head in the street and threatened to drop her..that is the day I left him. His father called the police and had them come get him. Then he called my mom and told her she had better come get me and the baby if she did not want us dead. He said that he had got my husband locked up for now, but that it was his son and that he did have to go get him out. So my mom came and helped me pack up and leave.. That is the first chapter of my life..it does not get any better..but it does help to tell all on here. I will tell more later. I need to go to sleep for a while and pass some time. Thanks for the chance to just ramble on here.","I live my life day dreaming of what could be and what should be..I am a 38 year old female and my problems started when I was born.

"Just graduated university. Anxious and depressed, cannot find a job, scared of losing partner over it Hi everyone. This is my first post on Reddit. I just felt like I needed advice from people who might understand. I am in my early twenties and just graduated with a bachelor degree in psych in October. I never really had a job during that time because I was lucky to have my school and expenses paid for and I wanted to focus on school. I have only had one job but it was 5 years ago just at a fast food place. My boyfriend of almost 4 years and I live together. He has a great job and pays for 2/3 of our expenses and I pay the rest. He is recently told me he does not see a future for us if I do not get my life together and find a job and start putting more into the relationship. I feel this is coming at a bad time because ever since I graduated I am really anxious and depressed. I find it hard to even get up in the morning, chores get neglected, I do not even want to get out of the safety of my bed. The world is bleak and I am sad all the time. I cannot sleep all night and then sleep till mid afternoon. I feel like my life is just staying home and having to do chores and feel sad. I try to apply to entry level jobs like cashier at the grocery store but no one calls back. I do not know what to do because I want to get better and do not want to lose my bf but I cannot even get an interview to work at a high school level job. He has been really supportive and caring but I think he is getting to the end of his rope. I feel stuck and hopeless.

"Therapy did not work for me at all. As long as I can remember I have been depressed, and have been thinking about killing myself. Last year it got to the point where I decided I needed to try therapy. I went for a while, but there was no improvement. During this period I just got worse and worse until I stopped going. I wish it would have worked, but it did not. I want to try it again, but since I am unemployed I cannot afford it, and even if I could, I do not think I want to spend money on something that I doubt will help. I have no idea what to do.

I used to have longer periods of relative normalcy in between episodes, but they seem to be happening more frequently this past year. It is too much to deal with.

"Awaiting the downward spiral. Had an awesome weekend with a whole bunch of friends from online who all came together, from all around Australia, for three days of drinking and festivities. Now I have travelled home and I am all alone again. It is great that I have so many fantastic friends Online, but it is horrible we all live so far away. I am already missing them terribly, and feeling down. I know that I am about to spiral downwards even futher after having gotten drunk for three days. It is inevitable, but I am trying to prepare. I am going to try and draw, spend time with my Service Parrot and submerge myself in my gaming community. To keep myself as positively distracted as I can. I am already trapped in an endless loop of thinking about my ex, who I still love and miss so much, and beating myself up. Searching for answers and ways how I could of been a better person for him. He told me he hated me and that I made him feel like a child. But i never intended for my help to make him feel like that. I tried to support and encourage him with everything. Emotionally and financially. I pushed myself to work 30+hrs a week when I was anxious and depressed because he became so closed off, so we had a roof over our head and food in our belly when we were made homeless. I tried to help him with being motivated to work, and to be able to support himself. I gave him every part of myself, because I loved him so much. And I keep holding on to things he said, before he forgot what this love really meant to him. And all the love that I gave to him, that never got into him. No matter how hard I tried. I wish he knew I do not hate him for what he said to me and that my suicide attempts were not to make him feel guilty. I genuinely wanted to end my life. The thoughts of whatever I had done for him to hate me weighs so heavy upon me, that I fear to live with a guilt that was my own. I failed to be the person he wanted me to be, but worse; I failed to be the person I needed to be for him. Now we are 200km apart and, Emotionally, I am struggling to keep my head up. Financially, I know He is struggling too. Everyone keeps teling me I should not care about him, but that just makes me hate myself more, that I do. I know I am going to spiral further, it is inevitable, but I am trying to prepare. *breathes* Edits: Grammr/Punctuation","It is inevitable, but I am trying to prepare.

"I have lived with depression since I was little. I was molested by my uncle and a family friend and my dad is in and out of prison all the time (I am guessing that is where it all started from). Well, when I hit my freshman year in high school, I had no friends because I was so shy. I walked the halls alone, went to lunch alone, sat in the back of the classroom alone. I sat back there fantasizing about suicide and death, and I would cut myself, and I actually planned my suicide.

"I feel like a useless member of my family I may not help as much as the perfect husband would around the house. But, I would like to think I do a decent share of what traditionally a husband should be doing. My wife is not the most organized person in the world so me and her butt heads a lot when it come to finding things around the house. Car keys, laundry, tools, you name it, they will get lost around the house. I have tried taking my own copies of keys with me in my backpack to work or where ever I go. This way I do not have to be asking her all the time where to find X item. This was working til she lost her copy of the truck keys and had to call me to bring my copy to her one day. Since then, I only bring the key of the car that I bring with me. Well,.. did not take too long til that one got lost too.. I needed to use the truck and was not able to find any key anywhere. I asked her where it was and she responded with you have hands and eyes, you find it. I blew my top off. I yelled at her that the fact that I have to hide things for them to not get lost in the house is ridiculous! She brought up the fact that I could do more around the house like organize the laundry or help her keep the home tidy. I told her I would if she was not so damn unorganized. Every time i do end up helping her organize and clean she ends up messing everything up the next day anyway! She is type A personality and I would like to think I am type A-. I yield to her way of living most of the time til it gets to be too much. Maybe the reason I do not do more around the house is because it will yield the same results anyway, an unorganized mess.. I at least do the basics. I pickup after dinner. I take out the trash, (this job now goes to my son). Handyman work, I fix plumbing, appliances, broken doors, tv is, computers, iPhones.

"One of the biggest things i am struggling with (besides my depression duh) is finding a good therapist. I moved about 6 months ago, and I have not had luck finding a therapist that I can work well with. I know that I need help with cognitive therapy, and i have gone to a couple therapists who have cognitive listed as a specialty, but when I get into therapy with them, its all talk therapy with little to no help to me. Do not get me wrong, talking does help, but I know from my years of dealing with this illness that I need some good solid cognitive therapy to help me to overcome my lack of self n worth / self n esteem / confidence. Also, has anyone had any luck with alternative therapies?","I know that I need help with cognitive therapy, and i have gone to a couple therapists who have cognitive listed as a specialty, but when I get into therapy with them, its all talk therapy with little to no help to me."
"I have had quite a few life situations that have probably contributed to depression.1. I grew up in an emotionally/sexually abusive family..but the type of abuse that is just over the line enough to mess with your head, to make you wonder if it was really abusive or if you were just sensitive. I still talk to them and see them at times, but vast quantities of things go unsaid. 2. I left home for college, and almost immediately was recruited into a religious cult where I stayed for 14 or so years; I just got out a couple of years ago. 3. I had my first major depressive episode while inside and although I found a supportive therapist, she too was in the cult and therefore some of her advice at times was influenced by their beliefs. Also I was alternately shunned and ostracized, rebuked harshly, or encouraged to give up medicines/therapy by various members in various levels of leadership in the cult. 4. I very recently switched jobs to a much better job situation, but am still adjusting the environment. 5. We are in contract to purchase a home, which is great, but also an adjustment. The Question. My psychiatrist thinks I have been depressed for most of my life. Which makes sense when I look back over my journals and look at various things I did, said or experience. Thing is, to me, depression as a state of mind became normal. I did not know anything different than how I was feeling. So what happens is this: I mention something I have been experiencing to my therapist. She is concerned and asks if I have brought it up to my psychiatrist. When I do bring it up to my psychiatrist, he says, ""Why did not you mention this before?"" To which my response is: I did not know I should. Translation: I thought it was normal. Right now I am on Effexor, with Adderall XR as a booster plus synthroid due to a nasty run in with lithium. When I started I was okay. Great even, minus the utter exhaustion at the end of every day. Lately though I have been feeling..things..that I cannot describe. Sadness..but a feeling bigger and diverse than the word ""sadness"" can contain. Tired..but a ""tired"" with an emotional component. Feelings I do not have words for, but that pierce me to the bone. And that are not connected with anything in real time that I can think of. Is this normal? Deep strong feelings that surface out of nowhere for a time and then dissipate..usually on the weekends when I do not have work to focus on? Not feeling much of anything in between those times? Being vibrant and full of ideas yet calm and productive first thing after I take the medicines, but gradually fading to sort of numb, definitely tired, somewhat negative by the afternoon with exhausted, sink into the couch with the remote, hit the bed for a nap by 7:30, sometimes 6pm? How do you know what is ""normal"" if abnormal has been normal for you for so long? How do you know when it is time to have a sit down with the psychiatrist again?","3.

"I am a 26 year old married mother of three boys. I was recently diagnosed as having depression. I have noticed it getting a lot worse in just the past week. At first I thought to myself I do not have anything to be depressed about but the more I thought about it the more I realized what it was. Me and my husband used to spend time with our kids and go out and do things on Fridays or the weekends. I cannot remember the last time we just went to Walmart as a family for no reason other than to go. My husband does not understand what the effect of him not spending that time with me and us has had on me. Just like tonight instead of asking me and the boys to run to town with him, his friend went. I do not care if he is only going for an hour that is an hour we could have his time. I cry all the time when he is not here just because I miss my husband. I am 26 we should have a healthy active life with our kids but instead I work and come home, and on my days off I sit at home with my kids. When he is off he stays at home. He works and then him and his friend if they get off early go places in town and then he comes home. I do not get to do that. I cannot remember the last time I just went window shopping, just running around. My thoughts about not being around have gotten worse and that terrifies me. How can I get my husband to understand that him spending time with me would help this so much. He just thinks it is a joke and that is one reason I think he would not miss me if I am gone except he would have to find another maid.","My husband does not understand what the effect of him not spending that time with me and us has had on me.

"DAE not tell anyone about their depression for fear of being called an attention whore? When I was a kid I was constantly getting called an attention seeker or an attention whore, mostly by the wonderful folks on r/teenagers, and know I am not honest to anyone about my depression because I am afraid I will come of as an attention whore and I do not deserve to get help.

"Am I depressed? Or is this just my personality? The littlest things get to me. A small criticism here, a misread facial cue there. Most likely I am reading too much into things but idk how to change my way of thinking. I dwell on them. I cannot let them go. I can sulk for weeks on what a regular person would forget in an hour.

"I was rejected &amp; I feel great Last night I asked a close friend of mine on a date and was rejected, but strangely enough I do not feel dejected but rather proud and accomplished. To provide some background, I will be turning 20 on the 15th, and last year, just 4 days after my 19th birthday, I was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder. This disorder is characterized by long lasting, essentially uninterrupted periods of depression lasting AT LEAST 2 years, and in many cases, such as with myself, far longer. To provide a rough estimate, I have been depressed somewhere around a total of 13 years of my life. The depression has had a serious negative affect on my love life, at times making me cold and even cruel. The most egregious example of this was when, after having dated this girl for a few months, I stopped talking to her almost entirely and started flirting with other girls. Eventually she had to get her friend to break up with me on her behalf because I was refusing to talk to her. At the time, because of the depression, I thought little of myself, seeing myself as a worthless scumbag, and so I started acting like one. I was also afraid to open up to some else, so instead I became emotionally cold and avoidant. I hated this behavior in myself, and held a deep guilt for how I had treated women I had been with, so about 5 years ago I stopped dating entirely. Despite being rejected, having finally had the confidence and self respect to ask out a woman and accept the no graciously is a major growth in my self esteem and wellbeing, so having done so I feel a great sense of accomplishment. This has really helped boost my self esteem and confidence, even though I was rejected. There is no real point to this story, but I just wanted to get this out there, because I am really proud of the progress I have made so far.","I was rejected &amp; I feel great Last night I asked a close friend of mine on a date and was rejected, but strangely enough I do not feel dejected but rather proud and accomplished.

"I have been on antidepressants for probably 10 years now. I was on Serzone which worked very well. My husband and I decided to get pregnant so I had to stop it.

"Hi all, I am new - just joined yesterday. I am a 40-year-old wife and mother of five. I have struggled with depression my whole life - came from an abusive household and inherited some mixed-up genes. I was misdiagnosed last year with bi-polar II and spent a year on mood stabilizers and various other junk that made me a zombie. I am now on Effexor and just beginning to feel sort of like myself again. I am a freelance writer and I have a weekly column in our local newspaper. I feel like my creativity has gone to pot and I am waiting for it to come back. Over the last 18 months I have become pretty reclusive - do not answer the phone, do not get out much, just take care of the basic family needs each day - so I have felt very alone. I stumbled upon this site while doing research on Effexor. I have read a lot of the posts and have felt some hope that this might be helpful to me right now. My husband is worn out, as am I. I just want to be better. I want to be a better mother. I do not want to live my life this way. I have felt like half a person for the last 18 months. I want to be whole again. I am really struggling with self-esteem and guilt - I worry about what all of this is doing to my family. I hope and pray that my children are strong enough to go through this with me.

"I believe much depression is about a lack of hope 'I do not want to die, I just want to stop existing' Sound familiar? People just want to end the tedium, the suffering of being conscious. But most people would be depressed if not for a goal. I think most people would rather not exist than exist if solely to pick cotton in the sun or mine in poor conditions. But people who are not depressed do these things because there is a goal, a reward afterwards. There is a reason to be alive When 'whats the point?' is part of your mental vernacular and nothing brings a smidge of happiness anymore that driving force disappears and all it leaves is a depression",But most people would be depressed if not for a goal.

"How to deal with people who cannot seem to be bothered with you? Question is fairly self-explanatory. I ask this because recently (within the past 6 or so months), my supposed 'friends' have started to become quite distant with me and it is making me feel like total crap. They rarely ever contact me despite me having reached out a couple of times. It is all very fragmented. What hurts the most is I see them interacting with their other friends (on facebook etc.) and also that they have been online recently but still have not answered my messages. My friends used to be great, they used to consider me their closest friend and would reply quickly etc. But now I feel like I have been replaced and I have nobody left. Even back when I would hang out with them, they would be on their phone talking to these other friends of theirs and I feel so hurt. Being alone sucks. No matter what, I can never seem to make friends with anyone new. The majority of other people my age are living it up, but I cannot seem to do anything with anyone apart from my family. I feel like I am missing out on something. I feel so unwanted to the point I have started deleting all my social media to isolate myself even more. It is beginning to eat away at me and my depression is coming back, as much as I hate to admit it.

"Hi. I am new, and I am not really sure where to start in the forums! I have been treated for depression since I was 17 years old, and then misdiagnosed with ADD when I was 17 and that started a downward spiral with abusing Ritalin (snorting about 5-10 times my dosage) for about 5 years. That is over with. I battled with anorexia as a direct result of the Ritalin, and got down to 95 lbs. Then I ballooned up to 185 lbs. I lost 45 lbs. a few years ago and I have kept it off ever since (I have never gone above 144). I have been on Prozac since I was 17, and just recently switched to Cymbalta at the suggestion of my psychiatrist. I felt funny on it, and committed the ultimate sin: I stopped taking my medicines a week ago. I know that is bad. The last two days have been a nightmare, and I even contemplated swallowing a bottle of pills at one point. My fiance is the most amazing person in the world, and I am literally killing him with my sickness. I do not know what to do. I have been hysterically crying and inconsolable for about a week. Yesterday my fiance called the psychiatrist on-call with our medical program, and she said I needed to take the Cymbalta, so I did take one pill yesterday and again this morning. I do feel weird, though. At the center of it all is my weight gain; I gained about 10ish pounds (I weigh 140 at the moment), and NONE of my clothes fit me. I feel like a disgusting fat blob all of the time. Just one look in the mirror sets me off and I am HYSTERICAL for the rest of the day. All I want to do is sleep. SLEEP and never wake up. I have had an eating disorder in the past, and I know I cannot fall back into it (the anorexia was a direct result of the Ritalin), but I am just hysterical, depressed, and I feel disgusting all day long. My clothes do not fit and I feel fat and disgusting and horrible and I want to cry and rip out my hair. I am thinking this weight has a LOT to do with my recent downward turn in my depression, but I just cannot lose the weight. I work out constantly and follow a really healthy/strict eating plan, and nothing is working. I am just reaching the end of my rope, here. And to top it all off: I am getting married next month. I need help..I have called my psychiatrist, but I do not know what to do. I do not see a psychologist; I think I need to, but I have had bad experiences in the past. I think I just need help and guidance and a way to lose this weight and feel good about myself. Hoping this forum will help.","I know that is bad.

"I am not exactly sure what the topic is (kind of vague), but for me: Depression started around the age of 11 (I am almost 23 now), one summer I was sitting in my room, laying on my bed, listening to music, and gazing out the window, and it kind of hit me like a ton of bricks. I just felt like I did not even exist. Like the world outside my window did not exist. Like the sun would never shine again. Like life itself was pointless.

"Struggled with depression and anxiety for 3 years and made it through Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my experiences with depression and anxiety in the hope it might give someone else a reason to keep going. I am new to reddit, so I hope this is okay! I have struggled with severe depression and anxiety for the past three years and it is honestly been the most difficult thing I have ever dealt with. Mental illness is silently crippling. I have spent more nights than I can remember wracked with sobs, feeling incredibly alone, and fantasizing about suicide. I have spent more days than I can remember feeling hollow, being apathetic, and not caring about what happened to me. Depression is a fucking bitch, and even now, when I actually feel happy and loved and excited for my future, I am not naive enough to think that I will never have to struggle with my mental health again. But I think I have learned how to best cope with it. Medication did not work for me, and while I do believe that professional therapy can be invaluable to people struggling with mental illness, it did not make a big difference in my case. But I learned to focus on the present, to rely on loved ones I am lucky enough to have, and to forgive myself. Take it one small step at a time. So what if you could not leave your room today? That shit is fucking hard! You got up and you got out of bed, that is the first step. Learn to love yourself even through the despair and self-loathing. There is no one path to overcoming depression, and sometimes it is not exactly the cure-all you envisioned but rather learning to live with it. But I promise you all that one day, it will be better. You will be happy again. And until then, I am happy to listen to you if you ever need anyone to talk to or have any questions.","Struggled with depression and anxiety for 3 years and made it through Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my experiences with depression and anxiety in the hope it might give someone else a reason to keep going.

I am 17 now and I feel like committing suicide would be extremely selfish and I would hurt him and my family but there is no other way I am not happy with myself and it is what it is.","I was 12 back then, so my dad had the funds and everything but he never wanted to take me to the dentist which went unnoticed for 4 years and just a chip on my tooth became a huge problem, I got a gap and they look uglier than they did."
Anyone have severe anger with their depression? Any good coping strategies? I am about to see my first therapist this week for anger management and depression. I am about an inch away from ruining my 3 year relationship with my angry outbursts and tantrums. I am not in a real sunny place right now.,Anyone have severe anger with their depression?
"Tired of being lonely but there is not much I can do about it. I just want to feel like there is someone to talk to out there but, no one in my life ever wants to talk with me about anything except to yell at me or to tell me to do something. That is the extent of my daily social life. I could probably go a month without saying anything or talking to anyone and no one would even care or notice, I need social interaction like anyone else, but what do I do if I cannot get it? I can interact at work ok, but that is not really the same. Online interaction is not really the same either.","I could probably go a month without saying anything or talking to anyone and no one would even care or notice, I need social interaction like anyone else, but what do I do if I cannot get it?"
"I bet you think this post is about you. What do you know? I am back! And, if you are reading this, you are back as well. Glad to see you again. Looking' good, kiddo! Yeah, I know. I am a prick for not posting for so long. But, lately .. okay not lately. Basically, I just recently realized some worthless pathetic 'friend' of mine has been doing nothing but screwing me over since I have known them. Do not you hate that? Yeah, so unfortunately, this has taken up a lot of my energy. That, and I am poor. And some asshole sideswiped my car in the middle of the night and took out my antenna and side mirror, not to mention fucking up my door and windshield.

I hope the four-twenty holiday went well for all of you good-for-nothing potheads. I myself had a smashing holiday when some of that sweet vegetation unexpectedly came into my life. It was .. alright. Not of spectacular quality. Crap. Eh, did any other holidays pass since I last wrote? Easter, maybe? I believe once again I was drunk on Easter. Mother is Day is coming up pretty damn fast, however. Shit, well mom, I hope you appreciate handmade cards like you did when I was five. Fuck, where is that glue stick? And WHY DON'T WE HAVE ANY GLITTER?? Oh, well. See, this is why we need to be rid of holidays where I either do not get a day off and slash or holidays where I have to buy slash do stuff or suffer the consequence of feeling guilt. Do not I have enough guilt already? Sorry the funny is lacking, kiddies. It is hard to be funny when you want to beat someone is head in with a tire iron covered in bloody feces while Pantera screams in the background. I would have also accepted Slayer. Or Wham. I will post again when I stop feeling homicidal. okay less homicidal.","Yeah, I know.

"The one upside of being depressed I have recently noticed something that has, strangely enough, somehow helped me a bit with my depression. See, I have started not ""sweating the small stuff."" For example; stuck in traffic? It is okay. Spilled my coffee? Oh, well. My co-worker is annoying? Does not phase me. My thought process is like this: when I wake up and feel like dying, at least the spilled coffee gives me something to do in the mean time. Or standing in a queue forces me to be more in the present and not as much in my head. Since I came to realise this, I have noticed an increase in my general mood, or at least I have become better at coping with going outside, shopping etc.","Spilled my coffee?

"Is there a place on the internet that actually helps? This subreddit is flooded with depressed people. The few that do comment, usually only agree with the OP. Random articles are usually unhelpful.

Hi. My name is Jenna. I am 20 years old and just joined and figured that I should introduce myself. I found this site from searching online and think that it is great. I only started accepting the fact that I have been depressed last year because I have always been very good at hiding it from everyone else and I used to fool myself as well (if that makes sense). I have never been one to seek help from others because in the past I have always dealt with everything myself. The start of college and being outside (different state) of my home environment (which is the cause of a lot of anger and resentment that I also have) helped me to see that there was something wrong with the way that I was living and that I could reach out and get help. I am currently seeing a counselor (through my college and since I feel like I am working well with her that I do not need to seek other outside help yet) about my anxiety and depression but I feel that talking to others that are going through the same thing could help give me a different view on everything and be helpful as well. I am glad that I stumbled across these forums and I cannot wait to get to know some of you. Jenna,Hi. My name is Jenna.
I am glad none of my close friends know I have reddit If my friends knew how depressed I was and I how serious I am about committing suicide they would probably put me in some inpatient program. That would just make things worse tbh. The only time I feel okay is it work because I feel needed and I am helping people. Everyday is a constant struggle to stay alive and I hate that there is still a month and half left until the date I chose. I should probably write my letters soon just Incase I do not make it.

"when i was really young my sister who is like 5 years older than me got me to constantly play these role playing games with her where she was the dominant one in the relationship it went on until i was in 6th grade i think i do not know and the thing is, I am not repulsed by her or anything. i do not hate her. i did not know at the time it was wrong but even though i do now .. i do not really know my feelings about it but i think it is one of the reasons I am depressed. i have not been able to tell anyone about it. not even my psychiatrist. i wish i could but every time i get close i close up and get really anxious i wish i could get this off my chest. i do not know if my mom knows or not. we do not talk about anything and to add to this, i think i might be gay and i do not know if it was because of this or not it it started when i was 12 but i did not recognize it as homosexuality. I have only been with two girls while in middle school but that is it. i think some guys are cute and all but i just get really uncomfortable. my psychiatrist thinks i have some repressed memory but i do not know what to do about it. i always clog up whenever i want to tell someone something important i have this fear that they wont care or will tell someone else. my family has a huge problem with that and I have known too many deceitful people to trust anyone so if you have any ideas to what i should do please tell me","i do not really know my feelings about it but i think it is one of the reasons I am depressed.

"I am a 24 year old female and I am extremely ugly. Despite having tried a slew of products recommended by dermatologists, and washing religiously, I nonetheless I have the most disgusting skin ever (EVER. You know Freddy Kreuger? He suddenly starts to look quite appealing next to me). And I have .. unfortunate features. I have a nose that would shame Pinocchio, small eyes, and a manly jaw. This never used to bother me too much, because I have lived with being Unfortunate Looking my whole life, heard all the insults in school, and I figured that anyone who did not want to know me because of my appearance was not worth my time. I try to make the best of what I have got - I am not especially clever or talented in anything, but at least I dress nicely, get my hair done, wear makeup and all that, and I try to enjoy myself. I knew I was unattractive, but I hoped that people enjoyed my company, and that one day I might even charm someone with my lovely personality enough that he might want to date me despite my appearance (it has not happened yet, but you have got to tell yourself SOMETHING, right?). I have lots of friends, and even though I am forever boyfriend -less, I am the one that people seem to depend on for everything but sex, and that has always been a comfort to me. But yesterday, I overheard a friend - a friend! - saying that my skin is ""disgusting"" and I ought to ""do something"" about it. He said that it was no wonder I was single. He said it was a ""shame I wanted children so much, since no one would ever want to get close enough to impregnate me"". The person he was talking to suggested IVF. I do not think I will ever be happy again. I want to cut my face off. I want to cut my face off and stick a grenade in my mouth. I do not want anyone to ever, ever look at me again. I cannot believe how utterly worthless I feel. It is not just that they think I am ugly - that is hurtful, but I knew I was hardly God is Gift to Men. But that they would speak about me like that behind my back .. use THAT word in connection with ME?! .. I cannot believe how much I have been kidding myself!! The message is loud and clear: if you are ugly, you are not worth respect or friendship or love.","This never used to bother me too much, because I have lived with being Unfortunate Looking my whole life, heard all the insults in school, and I figured that anyone who did not want to know me because of my appearance was not worth my time.

"I just want to get this off my chest My depression comes and goes, same for my anxiety. The doctor said its that I have an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Somedays I feel fine, others I feel crushing loneliness. I am 28. Never had a girlfriend and have become distant from my friends. I have no idea of how to meet new people. I just.. I dunno, sometimes it feels like I should have my life on track by now. My sisters were married at this point, meanwhile, I never had an intimate relationship nor even a small idea of how to start one. I see people with successful careers, homes, families at my age, yet I feel like I am just going day to day growing older with nothing to look forward to. I do not want to kill myself but sometimes I wish I just ceased to be. My hobbies do not feel fulfilling any longer and sometimes I just want to sleep the morning away mainly to make the day shorter. I cannot even force myself to enjoy parties because I feel this pressure on the back of my neck and after a while and it becomes unbearable. I need to leave to feel better and yet I feel worse in loneliness.

"I checked myself in to a Mental Hospital I decided after dealing with months of annoying suicidal ideation that I should go to a mental hospital. I say annoying because I was aware of these increased thoughts and wanted nothing to do with killing myself. While I wanted a closed environment away from home stressors to solve my issues I was also afraid of going somewhere unknown. I went through with it (despite crying and feeling emotional on the way there) to get my life turned around. I feel very often that horror stories are told of hospitals. In reality, if you need the help, please seek it out. You may have a completely different experience than someone who claims they do not remember their stay and was drugged up to their eyeballs. My experience was a pleasant one overall. I went there and focused on fixing my issues and I would say I came out feeling better. I am not sure if I can or should give the name of the place but I am sure someone can let me know down below. I just want to share my experience and help people not feel so afraid of going to one. The place was pretty clean. An adult area for people 18 and over, rooms and halls split by gender. Bathrooms only seemed a bit off towards the end of the day or during the morning when people would shower. Roommates were sweet and tidy thankfully but the option to change roommates if there was a problem was always available to me. Groups were informative and engaging as well as encouraging for others to speak up if they wished. You had a good amount of personal time to do whatever. Outdoor activities were available permitting the weather. The place was meant for short stays of up to a week so anyone who is still there for longer may see the groups as too repetitive. The food was surprisingly delicious and great. Honestly expected school lunch type of food but there was variety and options for those allergic, vegetarian or needing gluten free food. There were staff members around whenever you needed them for anything. The treatment team could have been better. They were good to me but not to everyone there. Changed meds without informing me. I went from 5 to 10 to 15mg of Abilify. Good Lord I felt it once I was home. Then REALLY felt it when they made a mistake and I went cold turkey for two weeks because I could not get my prescription filled. I will update once I am properly back on it. So that is my experience. After a week, I came out feeling better. I got off of Wellbutrin after determining it could be the cause of my increased depression. The Abilify gives me energy to get up and not be stuck in bed all day. I feel better than when I went in. I know this is a long post, however I have been afraid of sharing my experience with others. I do not want to feel afraid of ashamed of having went, so here I am with this post. If this is also posted in the wrong place, please let me know and I will gladly move it to the right subreddit.","I went there and focused on fixing my issues and I would say I came out feeling better.

"First of all, a happy Christmas to one and all. My situation is that I have had moderate depression on and off since 18 years old, and 2 years ago aged 33 I had it so bad I had to be off work for 3 months. Then I tried the SSRI Escitalopram and it worked perfectly and I went back to work. I came off it a year ago and then 4 months ago I suffered a relapse and had to go back on it, and now I am OK (except when it came back for 3 days after a booze bender). My psychiatrist is saying I should take them indefinitely. As I have no side effects I am happy with this, but I am concerned about some reports saying that they start to work less well after some years. Is this right. And if so would not it be better to ration them so I only take them after I relapse? So they keep on working for longer, if not the rest of my life. Is there anyone on the boards here who has been taking antidepressants for many years who has found they have become less effective and now regrets having taken them for that reason. And now suffers depression that now cannot be treated by medication? Yes I have heard that you can switch to others, but surely the same type of reasoning applies? The psychiatrist said that I had endogenous depression with a reactive cause, and that she did not think that counseling would help. Does this make sense? A former work colleague of mine recently said that the antidepressants had made me start acting ""weird"". Well apart from posting on an internet forum I do not think I have done anything weird, and other friends agree with me. But other friends all think that it is not good for you to keep taking these ""happy pills"" for a long term, that antidepressants are a short term fix only. But what do they know.

My gf is planning on killing herself and idk what to do.. Ok so me and her have known each other for 9 months. We are in a long-distance relationship. We have never met in real life. I think she may be bipolar. One night she told me she cut herself a little bit. On her thigh. At first I thought she was joking. She showed me the mark if lefted in the morning and I knew it was serious. She is 16 and I am 18. She has told me before she wants to die. She has had a bad past with men but I will not go into any details. It was just really bad. She does not talk to her parents about it just me. Her mother and father may get a divorce so that makes this situation even worse. She can be really happy at times then really down. We get in fights sometimes but they are usually resolved. She always complains she is a bad gf because she treats me like shit. I forgive her for doing so because of her shit life. Today we were just talking casually and a few mins later she said I will kms on said date. Then I told her why would u. She said love u bye. We then went back and forth until I decided to leave her alone. She said she was not feeling ok. But I have never heard her give me a date before. Saying you will is one thing but a date means you have planned out how u want to go. I did not tell my parents the full story and neither has she. She has tried killing herself before. I did not know her at the time. She does not have any friends in real life and the ones she does have just use her. She is also behind in school which stresses her out.

I realize people is times do come, and he had health problems(As far as we knew, no heart disease, had been checked out) but he did not smoke or drink and he lost a lot of weight and took care of himself for the most part. He was slowing down, but no more then an older person would. To say it was a shock would be putting it mildly. I ugly cried in front of him and his hospital bed several times. I am just so broken up for my mom and my family. Of course, me too. But my Mom and Dad were married for 45 years. And although it was not perfect, they had a true love. And I have such a close relationship with my mother. So when her heart is breaking it is hard for me to see. I sponge it. I feel that pain. I have also unfortunately had to deal with siblings who are dealing with this tragedy by lashing out and trying to put themselves ahead of myself and my brother. (My sister and other brother). And that is been super difficult. They have said some ugly things that I am trying to look past at the current moment.

"I want a cat so much due to depression and loneliness.. I once had a cat I had got for my 16th birthday over 10 years ago before she died at a bit of a young age just almost a year ago. She helped me so much whenever I had suicidal thoughts; when I would get them and tell myself how much I should die, I would think of her, and then ask myself ""Who would take care of her? She would be so devastated if her own master was gone. I could never do that to her."" But ever since her death, I think I have been more depressed and lonely without her. I have been so much more angry and isolated, I think. I want a furry companion so, so much, but I do not think it will happen anytime soon, no matter how urgent or how much I rather need one, and that makes me even more depressed.

My wild guess is that it could take maybe a year for everything to settle, but I cannot wait that long at all before getting a cat. I am torn.

I am married and I work and go to school right now. I am just overwhelmed I do not want to go to my classes I do not feel like it is worth my time I feel like no one cares if I succeed or fail. I have had these feelings before this is the same way I felt when I dropped out of high school. I just feel worthless the only thing I even enjoy anymore is work and lately that has not given me much enjoyment at all I use to be eager to be there and now I am anxious to get off of work and come home and not do anything. My husband and I have been fighting a lot lately he has an anger problem that we have been trying to work through, and it is negatively impacting the way I feel. I can also tell though that he is worried about me he keeps asking me if I am ok or if I am mad at him I just do not really feel anything right now I am just numb. I just have a million thoughts running through my head and no matter what I do I cannot seem to get rid of the negativity. I am tired all the time, yet I cannot sleep at night that well but I have been falling asleep in the middle of the afternoons. I overreact to little things and the list goes on. I know what can happen if I let this go on. I nearly lost my life to the negative thoughts when I was younger that is the only reason I got help then. I have decided to see my doctor and get some help I just think I need some support I have no friends around here well at least that have any time to visit and my family is all 2 hours away.","Anyways I was hospitalized twice medicines worked for a while but then I would just crash down into a further depression.

"How can I Kill the negativity inside my head? As I am on my self improvement journey, even though I am making progress, I hear a voice in my head telling me horrible thoughts. It is lowkey making me depressed. It says stuff like ""you are so shit,"" ""you are fat so you might as well not even try with women,"" ""your grades are horrible,"" ""your hair is not cool yet,"" and ""oh so you can dress well now but you are still a shit person overall."" Even when I have an accomplishment like a successful concert or a new track of music, my jerk brain still tells me that I am shit and not good enough. Maybe I just need to hit the iron harder and keep getting in shape? How can I kill this voice? It is ruining my self esteem and happiness.","As I am on my self improvement journey, even though I am making progress, I hear a voice in my head telling me horrible thoughts."
"Depression is the enemy you cannot beat I am a fighter like I play brutal sports in college and I am used to pain, but when it comes to depression I want to defeat it in one simple step but it is not that easy. I go through days where I feel better knowing that there is nothing for me to screw up. I have these feelings not only at night when I am alone but when I am with friends and I know that they do not understand it because I get the normal response of ""everybody feels that way man."" and that is just a worse thing for me to think about. if everyone has it I must be a failure for letting it affect me in such a way where I cant get anything done for school and I just sit on my computer all day.

"How do i stop negative thoughts? I try to be positive. But honestly the last 2 years has been hard i feel my thoughts are getting worse and worse. I think i am worthless, weak, pathetic and more. And i dont know what to do these thoughts are eating away at me. I can have a good day and then start thinking these thoughts and lose all self confidence.

"I can really relate to what a lot of you have said, in being embarrassed about seeking help. Being a teenager I do not have really have the ability to seek help on my own, and there is no way that I am going to tell my parents. I tried hinting at it - telling them I did not care about stuff, that I hated being around people. I even tried making it completely obvious in giving up or ignoring things I am usually interested in, such as getting my driver is license (I am 16, I will get it soon). Unfortunately, she is a complete idiot and just passes everything off as being normal, somehow. Hell, once I told her flat out that I thought that 'life sucks,' and she still did not get it! How stupid can you be? Much of the time I feel like the biggest idiot on the face of the earth, but not even I am that dense.","Being a teenager I do not have really have the ability to seek help on my own, and there is no way that I am going to tell my parents."

"I have never had dreams that I can remember, before I started treatment for depression. Oh sure, everyone once in a while, I would wake up and know that I was in the middle of a dream when I woke, but I know at times I could go for weeks on end and never feel as if I had dreamt or if I had, I could not remember. I also know or have been told, we all dream every night, it is a fact, we just do not remember them. Since I have been taking medication for depression (Effexor and Klonopin), I dream every night! And not just one, several dreams. They are very vivid, most of them do not make any sense but some of them do. It just amazes me how much I dream now and the things I dream about and can remember!

"I am new here - was not quite sure where to start but ""special new member posting area"" seemed appropriate. I think I have been battling depression off and on for some time now. I saw a therapist briefly, for a couple months, but had to stop when it got too expensive and when I could not take the time off work anymore. I actually did not even start seeing her until the worst of my depression had already passed. Not sure I got that much out of it, but maybe I did not give it enough time. I was doing so well for a while, but in the last week or two, I can feel myself sliding back into it. There are certain things, issues, that tend to pull me into that hole. I would done so well at avoiding them, I felt like I was over it. But I am dwelling on them again, and I do not know what to do this time to break the hold. The smallest thing sets me off crying, and I have completely lost interest in the things I was so excited about two weeks ago, along with most everything else. I feel completely isolated - I have no one to talk to about this, which I guess is why I am here online. OK not sure what the point of this post was, but thanks for letting me get it out.

"What Depression is Like For Me. Having depression is like sailing with a hole inside your boat and only a bucket to keep you afloat. Depression is wanting to have friends but are too anxious to go out and stay a while longer. Depression is forcing yourself out of bed, not for yourself but those who count on you. Depression is having an empty feeling inside your chest while your head is crowded with self loathing. Depression is where people tell you ""it will all get better"" but only hearing the silent whispers of the wind. Depression is where you slowly lose your personality, joy, and interest for those things that you have used to love. Depression is where a stranger tells you ""I will be here for you"" and you take it as an insult. Depression is where you hurt, crawl on the floor crying, grabbing on to dear life alone in your dark room with your thoughts, too tired to do anything and then go to bed only to rise again to pretend that nothing happened. To pretend, nothing happened.","Depression is where you hurt, crawl on the floor crying, grabbing on to dear life alone in your dark room with your thoughts, too tired to do anything and then go to bed only to rise again to pretend that nothing happened."
"hey there depression, it is me, ya boi (a letter for u by urs truly) dear depression, look, my dude.. i have not showered in a week, and although i bleached my hair so you cannot see how dirty it is when that happens, i can still feel it and would really like to use that coconut shampoo i bought that makes me smell like, well, coconuts. i am not sure what i smell like right now, but it is probably not fruit. maybe that lavender febreze i spray all the time, if i am lucky. i have not done laundry in a month or so. i wore the same two dirty pairs of pants to work all week - the long ones, because even though it is been around 95F all week, i have not worked up the energy to shave my legs in forever. like sure it is 2018 and girls can be as hairy as they want these days woo go feminism or w/e but jeannie from accounting noticed when i had two vaguely different socks bc i was too lazy to find a matching pair and i do not need to give her any more reasons to open her big mouth tbh. i only got out of bed today to pee and eat a sandwich (which i thoroughly enjoyed - the sandwich, not the pee.. but maybe the pee a little bit too.. not in a weird way tho - so it is nice to know i can still enjoy things, even if i have developed an unhealthy coping method with food and am going to get fatter and hate my body even more. but hey, at least it is not drugs). which also reminds me that i need to do dishes.. or i could just keep buying disposable dishes, so that i can let that pile up in the trash i desperately need to take out instead. i have shit i have got to do that i was supposed to do last weekend, but also spent that weekend in bed (you are terrible in bed btw), and considering that i am writing this at 6am instead of sleeping like i was supposed to start doing several hours ago - after i was supposed to take the meds that i did not get up to take - the forecast for today is pretty bleak as well. of course, you know all this, because you like to stop by every couple weeks and make sure of it. i think you are more regular than my time of the month (which would probably be more regular if i could just stick to taking my birth control every day, but we already established that i suck at taking pills that i am supposed to). i wish i could just get up and do what i need to do like a real adult - so many people do it, and on my best days i can even pretend to be a real adult as well. but with you here, lurking around my apartment without even helping with the vaguely overpriced rent, i cannot seem to get anything done. so if you could just, like, leave for a couple of days before i run out of clean underwear too, i would greatly appreciate it. sincerely, a concerned citizen","hey there depression, it is me, ya boi (a letter for u by urs truly) dear depression, look, my dude..

"I used to know exactly what I wanted to do in life, but now when I look foreword all I see is eventual suicide. My whole life I have wanted to go enroll in Animal Studies at NYU to eventually get a degree in zoology. It is been my dream for as long as I remember. I was going to get good grades, get my driver is license at 16, stay in shape, eat healthy, get married, have kids, earn enough scholarships that most of my college was paid for, and get a job that I loved. Basically be the perfect woman. But now, everything seems so impossible. I am currently failing most of my classes because I cannot find the motivation to do assignments, which causes anxiety to wrack up even more than usual. It is just been awful. Anyways, when I try to look foreword once again that my young, stupid self had planned out when she was little, all I can see is.. nothing.

"Exercise will make you feel better! Is what everyone says. So I listened and signed up for a gym membership. Fast forward one year later, I have become *so* obsessed with the image of my body and being as thin as possible, I overexercised and underate, so on top of my depression, I messed up my health and I developed an eating disorder which is making me far more depressed.

"Hi, I am 19 and new here. I have suffered from acute depression for getting on for 18 months now. I currently take Citalopram, having tried Fluoxetine but it was not doing much good for me. I self-harmed on-and-off from the age of 16 to 18 and have been stopped since last June. I recently became engaged (on Boxing Day!) and last month emigrated to live with my fiance. I have previously received some CBT for depression and OCD but that stopped when I went to university in Sept 2005. My mental health deteriorated drastically whilst at university and in December I made the decision to leave. I am hoping that I will soon be able to get some counseling or other sort of psychological therapy here, and to start coming off my medication at some point soon, although I do not want to rush that as I do not want a relapse.",I have previously received some CBT for depression and OCD but that stopped when I went to university in Sept 2005.

Pain stays with us for longer. Pain and chaos happen to all people. Suffering is a widespread human emotion. Why do we put on a masquerade amongst each other? Why put yourself through an existence of pain? How many lives have been lived in pain and died in them? Nobody asks for an existence, it is thrust upon you. What you do with it makes you who you are, but what life does to you typically makes you live an existence of either easier happiness or rolling agony.

All I could think was no I do not want to find just someone, I wanna be with someone who resembles the guy I cannot forget. Not anybody will do and if I am such a good person he would have stayed friends with me.

My SO has panic disorder and it is making me depressed. My SO has been diagnosed for now with panic disorder (waiting on health monitor results to check to see if it is not something else) The last couple of months have been really hard. He has overtime gotten more worried about his health and every time is convinced that it is cancer or something else deadly. He can spend hours on google about a discomfort he feels and freaks out because webmd says it one thing and another site says something else. He checks his heart rate every 15 minutes because he downloaded an app on his phone. I have taken him to the er multiple times in the past couple of months and each time they say that is nothing is wrong he is just having bad panic attacks. He will not believe them because then he will go on reddit and see stories of people being misdiagnosed. I am convinced he is a hypochondriac. We cannot go about one day without him saying he does not feel good. It is hard to enjoy myself whenever we go out because I am just waiting for him to say something about not feeling good so we can just leave wherever we are at. I do not know how to fully support him through this. When he freaks out and wants to call the ambulance I do not know if I should let him knowing that they are just gonna say he is fine or tell him that it is in his head and make him feel like I am not taking him seriously.

It is hard to enjoy myself whenever we go out because I am just waiting for him to say something about not feeling good so we can just leave wherever we are at.
When he freaks out and wants to call the ambulance I do not know if I should let him knowing that they are just gonna say he is fine or tell him that it is in his head and make him feel like I am not taking him seriously."
"Girlfriend on antidepressants no affection Hi everyone, my GF of 2 years has been on antidepressants for about 15 months, there is a definite lack of sex drive since then, but I understand that can be a side affect and she is acknowledged it and we have spoke about it. But sex itself is not really the issue. There is a distinct lack of affection. We never make out. Or really kiss unless I initiate it. Or hug much. It makes me feel shitty and lonely when I am consistently the one pulling her in for a hug etc. I have spoken to her about it and she gets defensive and says she gives me plenty of affection and makes it seem like I have got a problem. I am just wondering whether anyone has any thoughts on if this is also a side affect or whether lack of affection is completely down to her as an individual?","Girlfriend on antidepressants no affection Hi everyone, my GF of 2 years has been on antidepressants for about 15 months, there is a definite lack of sex drive since then, but I understand that can be a side affect and she is acknowledged it and we have spoke about it."
"I had really bad anxiety attacks/panic attacks when I am on the first couple days of my period. I mean bad.. to the point of having to stay home from school for 2-3 days. I would be in so much pain and extremely depressed and so many other symptoms. I found that when I got on birth control.. around 5 months on it, they stopped being so horrible. I do still have to watch my diet around the time though.. my blood sugar gets extremely low and I pass out and shake a lot. I would say maybe talk to your doctor about birth control.. it was a lifesaver for me.

I cannot make it better I am tired of nearly every aspect of my life. Changing it for the better would require money. To get money you have to work. Work is boring and tedious and makes me miserable. That goes for any job I could realistically obtain. I cannot do more than part time. I will never have the kind of money it would take to change my life in ways that might make me happier.

"I feel as though eventually I am going to kill myself I have told a couple friends this. They have told me that I need to see my therapist more, and that I need to get back on my meds. But what if I am content with this thought? I do not remember the last time I was truly happy. At best I am content. Most of the time though I am in a shitty mood. I do not really give a fuck anymore that people might be upset that I would commit suicide. I definitely do not give a fuck when people get worried when I say that I am gonna do it eventually. It is what is. I am not happy, I never will be. When I tell my therapist that I will never be happy he asks me if I can predict the future. Obviously I fucking cannot but if the last 15 years have been any indication of what my happiness is gonna be then it ai not gonna get any better With all of that said, and here I go contradicting myself, but all of what I have just previously wrote scares the absolute shit out of me.

"I lost a friend I just graduated high school and all throughout high school I have struggled with depression and anxiety. At my school, there was this really cute girl who I had a crush on. She was in two of my classes and I got know her pretty well. Although she was kind of out of my league and I could tell she was not into me romantically, I never minded just being her friend because she is really sweet and mature compared to most other people at my school. It made me really happy to spend time with her and made my day so much better at school even if it was just walking in the hall for a few minutes. Most of my mental health issues came from school related things and when I was with her I would totally forget about all that stuff. Unfortunately, sometime towards the end of the school year, she started dating another guy and after that she did not really seem interested in being my friend. Now it is summer and I have tried to keep in touch with her. I send her snapchats sometimes but she usually leaves me on open. I hate seeing pictures of them together. I want to tell her how I feel and that I wish I could be her friend still but I am worried it will just create a bad situation. I really do not know what to do.","Although she was kind of out of my league and I could tell she was not into me romantically, I never minded just being her friend because she is really sweet and mature compared to most other people at my school.

"I [18F] finally feel like i am getting better I was diagnosed with depression about 4 years ago.

My parents tried their best but were at a loss. Finally, I met A [18 M] last september and we started dating in July. And he has been the most supportive person i have ever met, would take days off of work to take care of me when I was too sad, would help me talk through things, told me why he loved me and that the flaws did not matter to him. He is the absolute best and I have not even thought about suicide for the past three months. It gets better, I was really lost, was hoping i would die and I found my cure.

Then my grandmother woke me up for a breakfast that everyone argued over, even with a goddamn three year old. Nothing changed, I just had a bullshit dream that will never really happen.

"How are you? I am not okay. I am in a kind of adverse situation, my thoughts are all over the place and I really do not know how to break this cycle. Basically what happened was that a few days ago, I sent my best friend a message before school, saying that I would not attend classes because I was not feeling too well, that I felt like giving up and that, in case I also would not have been at school the following day, I had probably killed myself. I was not joking. Sometimes I get these sort of impulses, most likely caused by me being overwhelmed by my emotions, my thoughts, and as a result of that, it feels as though I lose my common sense, my ability to think rationally. My thought patterns become unpredictable, but so far I have managed to not act on them, or else I would not be writing this right now. Currently they have been happening a lot more frequently than usual and that seriously freaks me out because during those times death seems like such a good solution to my problems. So, back to the story. Obviously, my friend got really concerned and encouraged me to come to her place because she would been staying at home that day. BUT she also contacted my mom, which I did not know until hours later, and told her that I was not at school and made a concerning remark, but I do not know exactly. My mom started to call me like every minute and I started to panic because I thought a teacher had called her, so I did not pick up any of her calls. I spent the rest of the day with my friend, but called my mom in the afternoon. She asked my where I was and it sounded like she was crying and I told her that I was at my friends place, but after that she declined the call. That night I slept at my dads place, my mom called him and told him that she did not care anymore about what I was doing and that kind of hit me. It was the last thing I wanted to hear in that situation. I just do not know what to do. I really do feel miserable. My friend is beating herself up because she thinks it is all her fault and I do not know, I just feel bad for feeling bad, if you know what I mean. That message was a cry of help in a kind of way and I do not understand why my mom reacted the way she did. It just makes me think that maybe everyone is really better off without me. I have been depressed for nearly five years now, but my mom never really paid attention to it and just marked me down as lazy. I have been doing great for a good six months in 2017, but then somebody really important to me, somebody that kept me going, passed away in December and since then everything had taken a turn for the worse. Life has become so hard for me, I am sleeping the days away because I cannot bear the thoughts, the guilt, because I am too much of a coward to face reality. I am trying, I really am, but no matter what I do, this feeling, this feeling that eradicates my will to live, remains.","I am in a kind of adverse situation, my thoughts are all over the place and I really do not know how to break this cycle.

"I guess I am writing because I do not know how to think or feel at this period. I feel that I have hurt a lot of people by having my depression, especially my parents. I have not phoned them in 2 weeks, I just do not have the courage to talk to them. I guess they feel that I blame them for my condition. Same with my remaining 2 sisters. Dang what a situation I have put myself in! I still have a group of friends that like me a lot, but I have not told them about suffering from depression. I hide it inside and either act in anxious way or I do solitary activities such as write poems, play the piano or swim. I guess the main embuggerance is that I finding the third year of my course a real struggle at the best of times, but having understanding tutors and talking to doctors that have depression help. I do not know why things have turned out the way things are, why I struggle with anything remotely challenging, but I guess that will never be explained. Sometimes i feel frustrated with the way things have turned and I can do very little to change the current of of my present situation. I feel kind of sick with stuff at the moment. Not that I am assuming a victim complex, but just that in all the poems I write about, I always seek a sanctuary from the business aspect of life, you know the dog eat dog, go compete with others to get a job and survive for the next 55 years of my projected lifespan. Yeah pretty heady thoughts I am having! I guess I am just scared of the future. I do not know how to survive, I kind of want to blank the future out. I guess all in all, I want to live a simple life and be decent to others. I would like the people I meet in the future to say hey that Haymond guy was a splendid fellow who really loved people and would go out of his way to help them, because he could. But than an inner anxiety knows that I have hurt people from withdrawing into myself and by depression is virtue being too self indulgent. That hurts the most, knowing I hurt people from my depression. I never intended to harm anyone or be this way. If I could smile and be happy I would, but I can only show the scars of my mental pain as a testament to self torment. Do not get me wrong, I smile sometimes and even rejoice in the company of those friends in normal health, but I guess I feel rejected. Self rejection and by that of the stigma of the people of the same age I encounter on campus and at home. I want this to stop I guess. I want a placebo pill that will transport me to the Elysium fields, because sometimes reality is a bugger to experience. I guess the main message is that I want respite from this life, some form of relief and rest, where I will achieve or obtain this elusive elixir of peace. But I am here, still standing, still finding a lot of life a challenge, still merging into a crowd of people who are too proud to admit that sometimes things may be too much. Who am I and what am I doing here .. I have not a faintest clue. Yeah, I am scared of defeat, of a battered ego that even a shred of self esteem that I had will be allowed to fly in the fresh wind. Its sounds like I am asking for love .. I guess I am. Also that I would love some help, and in no small measure I have requested that help from doctors and therapists and talked to you my dear friends. But I find it extremely hard to help myself, to make amends with the very mind that hurts me so. I do not know what to think is what I wrote at the top of the blog, now seems apt to include it in the conclusion. I guess spilling my emotions has made me feel somewhat dizzy! I guess I will wander, spinning round in circles until I get what the whole dang thing of life is all about.","I guess I am writing because I do not know how to think or feel at this period.

"My best is not enough. Ok, so here is the situation: I broke up with my ex five months ago. As soon as we ended our thing, I started running everyday, eating healthy food only, and going to the gym. 1h30min of HEAVY exercise everyday. I did this until this very day. I lost fucking 15kg (my weight at the start was 90kg, now 75kg). I also bought green contact lenses to wear, and even sunbathe. I invested so much time (and money) to improve myself and look amazing and no. one. noticed.! I look at the mirror and I am happy with my results. Then, the moment I exit my house:BOOM. 4 months thrown into the trash. No one cares. It makes no difference. The women I am attracted still do not find me attractive. It pisses me off how I imagine they will not survive just one week of my training. They cannot see how hard I worked to change. I downloaded Tinder,even saw my EX there, wrote a BIO describing myself (I still find myself interesting. People, do not) and I got nearly 0 matches. Now I am stuck in an Alcohol /Cigarette/Party/OneNightStandGirls loop and I cannot get out of it. I drink so much that I cannot even remember some things. I have fun, yes.

If I do not succeed, if this becomes a botched suicide attempt, there really will be no life after that. My parents will hate me. My friends will leave me or treat me with kid gloves.

I expected a slight reprieve from the evil, dark thoughts swirling in my mind. No. Everything just seemed to worsen with time, with me.

"Here is my answer to your age question. Sadly, I am 29 years old: sniffle1: Do not get me wrong. I do not want to be completely alone for the rest of my life. There is a sentimental part of me that yearns for companionship with a guy, but I have such a tall hurdle to overcome before I can even get to that yet. Yeah, but I can relate to the peace and quiet thing by myself. It really is such a luxury nowadays (personally speaking). One thing I reflected on was that I live in a family of 8 people, and maybe that is why I feel so claustrophobic and irritable around lots of people. Essentially, there is no secure privacy, really. Yup, like you I used to live independently when I went to school. I am on a bit of a break right now, but will go back in September where I will share an apartment with a roommate I do not know. Right now, I am mooching off my parents' food and shelter. At age 29, I feel like a little child. And by the way, I am unemployed too. I tried all summer to land a job, but in vain. I only worked one day for Elections Canada, and that was it. Oh well, a paycheck is a paycheck, right? The thing is, I cannot stand living with somebody I hardly know either. Sometimes I just do not want to greet somebody at breakfast, or say a polite 'hello, how are you, or how was your day?"". When I battle depression and social anxiety, I really really need the comfort of familiar people around me at times. The last thing I need is a complete stranger sharing my quarters. But, it is something I cannot help. I will probably isolate myself in my room for a while. At least I get cable TV and the internet. Then again, I will probably become a complete hermit during the school year.","One thing I reflected on was that I live in a family of 8 people, and maybe that is why I feel so claustrophobic and irritable around lots of people.

"So depressed that I developed disassociation. So I am going to bed after posting thus so sorry if I do not respond right away. I am 32. My short and sweet backstory is that I lost the love of my life because of alcoholism and depression. The way we broke up was the worst thing to happen to any person. She basically called the police on her way home from work, had me put in jail for a week on false charges and since I moved out of the state I could not call my family while I was incarcerated and charges eventually dropped. It broke me so terribly that I literally split personalities. I have the me that stares deep into the darkness all the time and the me that deals with and tries to make sense of the aftermath. Every time that person takes over I feel a part of me being lost. In a way it us insanely scary that depression can eventually turn into this. For the record Yea I do see a psychiatrist, a therapist and have a great support system. It just sucks because even with all that I am losing thus battle.

"Depressed? Or Just in a Bad Rut? (Long Post) I have never really felt like I have had depression before. I am turning 24 at the end of the week, and this is the first time I have honestly wondered about myself. Usually, I am pretty happy about things, and my outlook on life has always been realistically positive. But, lately, I just feel absolutely lost. And this morning, after I got off of work, I sat and cried. I am not much of crier at all, and the only other time I have cried in the last ten years has been at an uncle is funeral recently. This past summer, for me, was a pretty great time. I was in a relationship with a girl who really made me happy, more than any other one had before. I seemed to be having fun every weekend, whether with her or with some friends of mine or family. I had a lot on the horizon, and a lot to look forward to. I was getting ready to finish up my degree, and it seemed like things were going in the right direction. The only thing that was a problem then was that my job was a third shift job, but it was 3 days a week, and usually 11-13 hour shifts, meaning I had time to do stuff outside of it. But, my then girlfriend and another friend had solid connections that they thought could help me land a much better job where they worked, which would carry me pretty well until I finished school. Things were looking up for me. I was pretty happy. I guess things started to slip for me when my uncle got hit with a terminal diagnosis in August. At 47, and with young children, nobody in the family was prepared to lose him. And the disease, an incredibly rare degenerative brain disease, was the same one that killed my grandmother 11 years ago. We lost him in early September. The thing with this disease that nobody in the family is talking about is that, if it hits twice within the same bloodline, there is a 50% chance that living relatives within the bloodline will get it in their 40 is or 50 is. There is nine of us left in the immediate family, including my mother, my brother and myself. And since it is so rare, there is absolutely no treatment plan. That, for me, was a lot to process. I am not worried about myself, but the idea that I could still be losing relatives to this disease for years sucks. It is hard enough seeing it happen twice. During this time, things started to fall apart with me and my then-girlfriend as well. I kind of hid out with her for a while, because my family was perpetually sad and in a state of distress. And since I worked nights, I was kind of isolated. Things started to hit a rut between me and her when she started her own treatment for depression. I tried to be supportive of her, while doing whatever anyone in my family needed while my uncle was sick. She really seemed happy that I was there for her, (and things really worked out since she lived so close to my uncle anyways, and I could bounce back and forth from place to place on my days off.) Both my family and my girlfriend were very important to me, and I guess helping them out made me feel good about myself, even though the situation was shitty. I kind of let school fall to the back-burner though. And I kind of neglected my other friends for a while as well. But between work, my family, and her, I was consistently busy. My uncle passed in early September, sending most of my family into a pretty bad state, and only a week later, my girlfriend decided she was done with me, because she was afraid that if she recovered from her depression with me around, then she would equate me with happiness, and if I left her then she would not be able to recover. (Which ended up being mostly a made up way of saying, I do not love you anymore, but I do not have the courage to tell you.) Obviously, it was not fair to her to be stuck with me if she was not happy with me, but there were so many better opportunities for her to break things off, and she chose the one that was the most tedious and mentally draining for me. My state of mind after it ended was not great at all, and I said some very mean things to her after it ended, (I guess, at the time, I thought it was constructive criticism, but it was all just mean and awful and embarrassing.) Understandably, she has not talked to me since, and I feel like I burned any bridge towards reconciling with her. I missed my uncle a lot, but doing favors for his wife and kids helped me at least feel like I was contributing. My mother is still kind of a mess about it, but she has my father for support. My brother had a hard time for a while too, but his job keeps him well occupied. But, lately, for me, the things I can help with anymore have been fewer and fewer. Right now, I just want to fast forward to like March or April. I do not want to deal with my birthday, since the plans I had with my ex-girlfriend are obviously not happening anymore, most of my friends are busy with work and school, and my family is still not back to being normal. Nobody seems to want to do much for my birthday anyways, which is, for lack of a better word, normal for me. When I got home from work this morning, I cried thinking about it all. I have never had that kind of emotional reaction to anything before. The only thing I look forward to in life at the moment is my night or two out with a friend a week. The holidays are going to be rough on my family, I know now that my ex girlfriend (who I still care for and would probably take back) has completely moved on from me, and the once promising prospect of a new job is not nearly as likely as it used to be. And, school kind of got caught up in the shuffle, and I am not where I wanted to be with that, either. I am going to be out on my own come January, which might help, but right now I am just dreading the next month. I feel like the things I care about are slipping further and further out of my control, and it is hard for me to deal with. I do not know if this is just a rough patch in my life, or a sign that I have a more serious problem. But right now, I have very few people that I can be 100% open with, and it is been tough. Work is, for lack of a better word, quiet for me, meaning I spend most of my time thinking, and it does not help much. Since I have never really had a stretch like this before where I have been as mentally drained and just sad, I am not really sure what to do. But there is very little on the horizon that I am looking forward to, and I am worried about that. tlr: Stretch of life events, most of which out of my control, have wreaked havoc on my emotional state. I now feel kind of hopeless. Do not know if it is just a rough patch in life, or something worse.","Usually, I am pretty happy about things, and my outlook on life has always been realistically positive.
But, my then girlfriend and another friend had solid connections that they thought could help me land a much better job where they worked, which would carry me pretty well until I finished school.
The thing with this disease that nobody in the family is talking about is that, if it hits twice within the same bloodline, there is a 50% chance that living relatives within the bloodline will get it in their 40 is or 50 is.
During this time, things started to fall apart with me and my then-girlfriend as well.
Things started to hit a rut between me and her when she started her own treatment for depression.

"I want to share my experience moving to NYC from Israel - four months ago Hello everyone, I just thought it would do good for me to share my experience moving to this city among other new yorkers and maybe hearing some new voices of people who are living here and know better than me or even went through the same thing. So basically, I am 28 years old and moved to NYC four months ago with my wife. My wife is doing her Ph.D. at Columbia University, and I just joined her (with a work permit during our stay here), and we are going to be here for at least 3.5 years, but we could choose to stay for five years if we wish to. (At the moment I do not see it happening) I have to say that moving here has been the most difficult challenge I have ever been through in my life. First, though my English is not bad at all, I am SO, SO insecure about it. I am feeling afraid to open my mouth and say complicated things, and it is depressing me. (I am a person who is talking a lot by nature. I have always been like that) And I feel like someone took away that ability from me and I am much less charismatic in English than in Hebrew which affects my confidence tremendously.. After smoking weed for 4-5 years almost every day in Israel, I quit doing it since the first month I got here only because it made me feel very anxious (it used to make me feel quite the opposite before) I used to be a teacher in Israel and pretty quickly I have found a job as a teacher that teaches Hebrew here in New York. (In Israel I used to teach History which I found much more interesting than teaching a language, but that is what I got here, so I have to live with that) A few days ago, I had a conversation with my boss, and apparently, they are pleased by my work there, and they asked me if I am willing to continue for next year which is nice to hear even though I do not like this job that much. I guess I will have to compromise. My wife and I are supported by an excellent scholarship, and we do not have to worry a lot about money or health insurance so, on the financial field, we are kinda covered. But being here makes me feel powerless. Obviously, I do not have my good friends here with me, and I feel much less ""special"" as a person. I feel like I am only one among millions who are trying to survive in this big hectic city. In the beginning, I thought it is beautiful that this city is full of people from all around the world, but now it just feels to me that everyone are strangers to each other and it seems like it is the loneliest city in the world at the moment. And because I do not have friends here and I am married (so meeting with girls on tinder etc. is not an option) I do not have many reasons to leave the house and it is kinda sad. The only reasons I am leaving my house is for yoga classes, work, and restaurants with my wife. Other than that I do not have any other reasons to leave the house.. The weather is fucking horrible, and it is so cold it is painful to me being outside. Anyways, I do not expect from you guys to be my therapist or giving me some life-changing advices.. I guess I post this to release some steam. So if you managed to read my post until the end, Thank you And I hope things will improve for me. I have always lived in Israel and only left for trips. The longest was 3-4 months, and I have never relocated my life to anywhere else. So maybe it is just a matter of time until I will start to feel more like home here. If you have anything to share from your experience, that would be lovely just to know that I am not the only one who is going through this adjustment period. Thanks again for reading and for your patience. Have a great week everyone","I want to share my experience moving to NYC from Israel - four months ago Hello everyone, I just thought it would do good for me to share my experience moving to this city among other new yorkers and maybe hearing some new voices of people who are living here and know better than me or even went through the same thing.

"I am having a problem with my depression. You see, I am taking more medicine. I am taking Welbrutrin (150mg) on top of my Zoloft (100mg). I have been out of work for over 5 months. And it is now SERIOUSLY making me crazy. I need to talk with people, but I do not know how. I need to find a job, but I do not know how. I am a good guy. In fact I am THE good guy. All of the people who have had me to work for them have loved me. I get promotions all of the time. It is getting in the door that seems to be the problems. And I have a family to take care of. My wife started working, but it will not be enough to pay the rent. This is so hard for me. I am of the old school. I believe in chivalry, the man taking care of his family. Except that I feel like I am being less of a man. I am broken. I do not know what to do. I can see myself being suicidal, but not in the sense of killing myself, but for looking for someone to help me. God I have never been in such trouble. And I do not feel loved. It is not my wife, it is not my son. But I think that not working for so long, and the fact that I do not have friends, makes me need contact with people. Any people. I just do not know how to do that.","I am having a problem with my depression.

"Embarrassing myself at volleyball tryouts I am a freshman in high school and we just did volleyball tryouts and they were fucking horrible. I had to wake up at 5:30 to go to them because they started at 6. Literally everyone there was better than me. I fucking hate everything. I am such a failure. Like everyone was doing actual spikes and sets and shit and I was just there. They probably thought I was in special ed. At least if I had a mental disability I would have an excuse to be so shit at volleyball. I am probably gonna quit tbh. I have never wanted to die more in my life. And I know you are probably gonna say do your best and I am but my best is not good enough. This is what I get for trying to be less depressed using a sport. I do not even look like I am in high school,I am just a short 5'0 Indian kid","Embarrassing myself at volleyball tryouts I am a freshman in high school and we just did volleyball tryouts and they were fucking horrible.

"Unrequited Love Crept Back Up to Haunt Me First off, I felt the need to create this fake reddit account so that my posts could not be linked to my actual reddit account, and I could vent to reddit without worrying that any of my family or friends will read this. Unrequited love is the worst. It consumes your mind almost every second of every day. I am usually a positive person (at least I try to be). Grew up with this girl in the church. We were the best of friends. In high school, we went to homecoming and senior ball together. I asked her out 3 times, once in middle school, once in freshman year, and once in senior year, all three times given the response ""I am sorry, I do not like you in that way."" It messed me up. Even affected my first two relationships. I got with my first girlfriend solely because she liked me. Part of me hoped my best friend would get jealous. I genuinely liked my second girlfriend and she liked me. This girl gave me the butterflies, but because neither of us made a real effort to be boyfriend and girlfriend, we did not last. Before, after, and sometimes during each of these relationships, I would wish it was my best friend (I know, a dick move). Then I messed up. I was influenced by a terrible person to say some things I should not have. We went to the same community college like we planned but three years passed without ever seeing each other because we were fighting. The time that we spent apart allowed me to clear my head. Before, I used to think about her all the time. Now, days, even weeks would pass without her crossing my mind. I met plenty of people in college and made tons of good friends, focused on my hobbies, it was the happiest I have been. Eventually, we got tired of fighting and I realized what it was that I fucked up: an extremely good friendship. After I made an effort to show how sorry I was, she made an effort to let me back into her life. Then I thought, ""Do not fuck this up. She does not need you to like her. She needs you to be a good friend."" I said some harsh things, and because of it, we were not friends for 2 to 3 years. So naturally, we tried making up for the time we had lost. She invited me to hang with her friends. I invited her to hang with mine. We would do things together, play music together, video games together, and just genuinely hang out. We talked things over and settled our fight by blaming that terrible person that we both dislike from before. We eventually went to the same university together and some of her closest friends became great friends of mine. We took a class together. Would exercise together. And we have gotten to the level of ""No judgment"" as she calls it, where I have told her some of my deepest, darkest secrets, and she did the same with me. Problem is, as we spend each week almost always hanging out 3 or 4 days out of the week. I find it harder to come to terms with us never being together. She is never dated, but she tells me about guys she is liked, little things that happened to her like small romantic contact like ""holding hands"". She has A LOT of guy friends that she is close with, and a few girl friends that she is really close with. And though it only bothered a little back then, it is something I am jealous of now. Each time I see her, I first think to myself ""be normal, be funny, do not show any signs that you may still have feelings"" and it works. I am happy with the way things are, us spending lots of time together, hanging out at each other is houses for hours, trying different foods, and just having someone like her I can talk to. But thinking about the guy she who will eventually be her first boyfriend, or her husband whom she may have kids with, that future where another guy becomes the guy she sings with, dances with, goes to church with, does romantic stuff with just pains me to think about. Well, it is late (like 3 in the morning) and this is the time when I am usually in my feelings. If you have invested time to reading my story this far, I thank you and would like to know what you think about my situation. I am a bit dramatic, and I overthink like a muthafucka, but I am an honest fellow, and this is first time venting to reddit. And it is a bit ironic, cuz I should get some sleep since she is coming over tomorrow. P.S. I thought about solutions like slowly drifting apart from her, but I have come to the realization that I would rather have her in my life as a friend than not at all. But it still hurts.","We were the best of friends.

Even hate eating I cannot even eat anymore everything tastes like shit to me do not like doing anything do not want to go anywhere do not trust anyone hate being alone but it is the only way I know to stay away from all the BS. What is the point of living such a meaningless worthless life?? Also I think I am losing my mind I catch myself doing weird things and sit there like wtf did i just do that for And sometimes if I am walking late at night I sometimes think hopefully someone comes up and shoots me or stabs me and this nightmare will be over,-
"Nothing. I just do not want to do anything. Nothing is the only thing that ever sounds good anymore. The stuff I study in school is really cool, but when I get home I just want to lay down and do nothing. Smoking weed makes it easier but I know I am just pushing my feelings away. I am just.. Tired. And I feel like a bitch because of it. I go to school, work on some homework, go to work, procrastinate homework to get some damn relaxation time, rinse, repeat. I wish I could stop working and just focus on school, cuz it genuinely makes me happy as long as I can dedicate the time to it. But after working I just wanna do nothing. And if I work less hours I just get stressed about paying rent. I do not know if I hate myself or this economy more, but I just wish I could go far away sometimes. Just leave everyone behind and find somewhere to sit and do nothing. Listen to a waterfall crash in the forest, or just look up at a sky that is not polluted to hell with light.

"In the mood to vent So I am gonna make this self deprivating post quick. I was a sick child. Shit was fucked. Too young to understand what was going on and had lots of surgeries and what not. I possibly have autism, I was diagnosed with sensory processing disorder to get O.T. however I think they gave me that so I was not stuck with the label of autism. I think they believed I was too young to be diagnosed and so I never got a checkup from a psychiatrist after O.T. . So it is possible I am autistic but idk. Anyway my childhood was shit. Absolute fucking garbage. I was the loser kid. Had physical issues so I never left the house. I was ugly and fat. My entire childhood was just a big fucking waste of time. Anyway I become 16 and start hanging around bad kids. At this point I lost all fucks to give about my schooling. My social skills were finally developed enough so I can make friends but I did not really like any of them. I started getting a prescription for drugs. It was not very difficult given my medical history. Started taking Adderall daily. And my mom would occasionally give me some Xanax she had. Also started drinking. I guess some warning signs for a shitty life but idk. I am not entirely sure what to do at this point. I plan on going to community college since I am probably gonna drop out of HS soon. I just do not think I am ready for the real world. I always feel like I am that one person who just cannot adapt to things.","Shit was fucked.

"I will be on the road in less than 72 hours. The last month has taken a serious toll on me physically, cognitively, emotionally, and spiritually. Things have suddenly gotten so crazy. Nothing looks even remotely familiar to me (Aggers, 2002). I have held My Sweetie with tears in my eyes, hoping her to buoy my hope for the future. I have been overwhelmed by the enormity of change and possibility, fallen to my knees, bowed my head beneath our roof, and prayed in earnest that it will not be the last. I have wrestled with the stranglehold of others' denial, silently observing time crush their last defense as the flurry of last-minute demands, requests, and desires are left unfulfilled. I have ended my beloved employment, said goodbye to supervisors and peers, returned keys, cleaned out my desk, and stood at the door of my empty office with the first true inkling of the magnitude of what has become the most difficult life transition I have yet faced.","The last month has taken a serious toll on me physically, cognitively, emotionally, and spiritually."
"Hi I am trying to get a grip back on my life. My mental health has cost me my marriage. My husband just could not handle it anymore. I was hospitalized five times in April and May for suicidal attempt and thoughts. He was there every day for me but felt abandoned by me. As he said through tears ""he could not save me"". After the hospitalizations I was really needy. He married a strong and independent woman. In Sept I took myself off my medicines and went into a rage and accused him of cheating on me. That broke his heart and his spirit..he left. Of course, I went into a tailspin. Finally got of the couch last weekend, three months later. I stopped my counseling and medicines. I know I have to get it back together again. I guess looking for support here is a step in the right direction. I am trying to figure out how to go on when you lost the best thing that ever happened to you. Thanks for listening","Hi I am trying to get a grip back on my life.

"I am new to this so please bear with me. I do not even know where to begin. With all of the tragedy going on in our gulf coast as well as the war, I feel I have no right to be unhappy but I am 24 / 7. I am 37 years old and have made a complete mess of my life. My parents were raised in Europe and came to the states in their 20 is. I have a younger brother who also has depression but it differs from my own. When I look back at my childhood all I feel is pain and neglect and I cannot recall any happy memories. I do not believe that I was ever physically abused however, I do think that I was ignored and emotionally neglected. Perhaps that is why I manage to make a mess of my life every time things seem to be going well. I am married and have a 4 year old son. From all outward appearances, my life comes across as perfect (although we all know there is no such thing). I have been seeing psychiatrists and therapists since I was 17 and have tried to commit suicide on four separate occasions. My mother suffers from depression and her mother did as well. This is such a long and complicated story and I do not know how much I am allowed to write or if anyone is even interested since this is my first try in any type of chat room. My interior pain lies so far deep that I do not sleep, hardly eat and feel miserable all the time.

"Well, I have to admit that as a male I have always viewed my own depression as personal weakness. I still do, I cannot help it ..it is a notion, feeling or philosophy or whatever that is been instilled from an early age. I know this is not a popular or realistic way to feel about depression. I mean, it is an illness, right. I have never been to a doctor to have my condition properly diagnosed or treated. At the moment, I really cannot face my doctor with that sort of issue (btw, I am in my mid-40s and I have suffered from depression since as long as i can remember) - I have learned to cope, in a fashion, but probably at the expense of a reasonable sense of social 'normality'- i.e. divorced, emotionally empty relationships, enormous amounts of time spent alone, dissatisfied working life, etc. One covers up & disguises the depression at work, at home, and wherever/whenever necessary..and then, when you are all alone, the demons can come out to play(or even before you are alone) - but at least you maintain the expected external masculine dignity, most of the time. For example, today my son wanted to come over to visit me but because I have been feeling so miserable and morbid and soaked in ennui this week, I made an excuse to put off his visit because I did not want him to see me feeling low & depressed(and weak) and thus ruining his day/week. Instead, I went out on a freezing 10 mile walk alone to try to physically squash the depression. This is a regular occurrence - I get depressed, I hate myself for being weak, so I do something physical to try to alleviate the symptoms(and also to punish myself for feeling depressed).. it works..temporarily. In my mind, this sort of masochism is (or has been)preferable to taking alcohol, drugs (even prescribed medicines), fags, therapy or inflicting real self-harm and so forth because, at least, it keeps me feeling physically fit-physically balanced(and I guess that is important to me) even if it is not always an effective cure for one is depression. And I can keep up the public pretence that all is well. Sorry, back to the point - yes, it seems a lot of men do tend to suffer depression in silence (one wonders what the real percentage could be!).When I joined this group yesterday it was the first time I would openly voiced the notion that I DO suffer from depression. Not so macho. Perhaps my condition is getting worse.. or maybe I am just feeling a little more realistic about what it is to be a male suffering from depression. Are there MANY women (or even men) out there who are truly sympathetic to males who suffer from depression? Unfortunately, I have not seen much evidence out there so far?","At the moment, I really cannot face my doctor with that sort of issue (btw, I am in my mid-40s and I have suffered from depression since as long as i can remember) - I have learned to cope, in a fashion, but probably at the expense of a reasonable sense of social 'normality'- i.e. divorced, emotionally empty relationships, enormous amounts of time spent alone, dissatisfied working life, etc.

"I think you guys might understand this. I was walking with a close friend after having lunch together, and I told her, ""I feel as if I am living on borrowed time."" She asked me to explain further, but I could not find the words to better express that perspective. She then proceeded to recount to me all of the myriad ways she is nearly died on some of the trips she is taken. I confessed that I could not really relate to those sorts of situations or how they have affected her, as she has more zeal for life than anyone I have ever met. Whatever she was describing about perceived proximity to death did not suit me. Then the words came to me. I feel as if I am living on borrowed time, because I feel like I could, at any moment, lose what little will to live I have left. It is like I am waiting for the other shoe to drop. I see it in slow-motion, slowly falling to the cold pavement, but I do not know when it will finally make contact. In the meantime, I am existing, trying to experience new things and connect to people as much as I am able to, but I cannot shake the conviction that I will eventually resolve to leave by my own hand, despite whatever life I have made for myself. The fight is already been lost, and at some point, I will have to accept defeat.","I was walking with a close friend after having lunch together, and I told her, ""I feel as if I am living on borrowed time.""

On other days, I am freaking the fuck out. It feels like I do not know how to do anything because everything seems so unfamiliar. From walking down the road to the grocery store to brushing my teeth.

"I have always resented my mom for being emotionally abusive growing up and blamed her for my depression. But I just told her I am depressed and she responded in the most perfect way. I feel really weird. I am an adult now (24) and have had crippling depression since childhood. Growing up, I never had emotional support or love. I was called names and my mom took out her relationship/life issues on me. I was distant from both my parents. I have hugged my mom only once in my life. This is just one issue out of many that led to me developing a fragile self esteem and crippling depression. Over the years, with distance, we started to talk- like once a month or so. The more educated I became, the more I came to understand why she acted the way she did (although I still harbor much resentment) I am going through a depressive episode just now. I feel so alone and I texted her out of desperation. I told her I felt alone and depressed and could not get out of bed to study. Instead of judging me or saying something mean..she just listened to everything and all of my symptoms. She said that she felt so sorry for me and she wished she could help me. And she told me to never feel alone because she loves me and I am very important to her. She asked if she could do anything to help me..and I realized, yeah, if we could call each other every morning, I could have someone to talk to and tell her about my daily goals. Then I could feel more motivated to get out of bed and feel less alone that day. I just feel weird, because I do not have a relationship with her. I am scared it is going to be awkward, but I am desperate for any support I can get right now. I also still resent her, but at the same time understand. I do not know. It is just weird. But, I am happy she acted this way, for sure. Edit: I also do not mean to brag or anything like that. I just wanted to share this with someone, and was wondering if someone had a similar experience maybe in forming a bond with their parents longer into adulthood.","I have always resented my mom for being emotionally abusive growing up and blamed her for my depression.

"""I used to be you"" ""It gets better"" ""You have to love yourself first"" &amp; other lies Not even sure if I should post in this sub, but.. To the people who *used to* suffer from depression, from trauma, from anxiety, from whatever made you miserable, I am not you. You were once miserable, like me, you saw no light at the end of the tunnel, but then, you did not give up. *Something* happened. Now you are happier, now you have got your happy ending, now you have got people who love you for who you are. But I am not you. You probably changed, you probably were capable of change, were strong enough to change yourself even. I am not you. I have been gone for a long time, now. There is nobody here but bad habits and terrible feelings. Sometimes I feel a semblance of someone who just wanted to make other people happy and be loved, but I think the misery just piled on like miles of permafrost. I cannot blame people for not loving me, but I do blame them for lying to me. Do not they know it hurts more to say 'I care' when they do not, and it takes me much too long to figure it out? How am I ever supposed to trust people when they say they care if it is been such a common lie? The worst part is, *nobody can prove it, because nobody can help me, because nobody knows how or wants to*, I do not know. I have been asking for help for a long time now but nobody takes me seriously. You, who says that I should not give up. Why? I am not you. Years from now I will *not* be surrounded by people who love me, I will *not* be anywhere closer to happiness, I will *not* find anyone who loves me. If that person exists, and perhaps they do, I will *not* ever have the luck to meet them. You tell me I have to love myself before anyone else will. Those who grow in complete solitude do not even learn a human language. So tell me, if there is nobody to show me how to, how do you expect me to teach myself to love myself? I think you just want to place the blame on me. I do not 'love' myself and so that is why I am miserable. Not because of depression, not because of isolation, not because of poverty, not because of heartbreak, it is because I do not love myself in a world that is only taught me to hate and criticize myself. In this world where the people I thought I could perhaps give my heart to, say 'I care about you' and then show me those words are meaningless. Forgive me for being skeptical about getting better when I have only seen my life decline since it began. I am not even asking for pity, because I know it is just the luck of the draw and I was dealt a particularly shitty hand. But can you please understand that not all of us are going to be okay in the end? Just because you suffered for many years and I have suffered for many years and you no longer suffer like you used to, does not mean I am not going to continue suffering as I always have been.","Now you are happier, now you have got your happy ending, now you have got people who love you for who you are.

"Work I have a problem with always assuming everyone thinks Im terrible worker(well outside of work i just assume people think bad of me and i try so hard to prove im worthy). Im not a bad worker. Im an awesome worker. I do good work and never spend time on my phone or anything like that. But when im working on a job I feel as if my boss is watching me thinking to himself. ""Fucking that guy needs to get a move on"" or something like that. Im constantly asking my boss "" So we have a good week? Anything you want to tell me"" he says no but I still feel he talks shit in his mind or behind my back. Its alot of wasted stress I wish I could stop putting myself through. Thanks for reading.

"Does anyone else is depression show itself as exhaustion? I find as I get older, that certain heavy type of exhaustion that can only be caused by depression gets more and more pervasive. As soon as things start going downhill, the unexplained tiredness hits and I become like a zombie. I have no energy to do my normal daily tasks, the thought of going through my evening routine before bed seems like climbing a fucking mountain; I barely have the energy to do anything other than sit on the couch and stare into space. The physical lethargy always comes hand-in-hand with the Brain Fog. Forget trying to study, forget going through the bills, my brain cannot handle anything except moving my index finger to scroll down Reddit and watching cheap entertainment on youtube or Netflix. I am writing this because I am in it now - in the Fog - and I am lagging behind in life. Does anyone else feel this way?

"I have had depression for at least 5 years now. I have been with my partner for 2 years and in that time i have come to depend on him for a lot of things - everyday things like making phone calls for me etc. because i find it too hard. In the last couple of months, friends / family have seen him out with another girl, they were closer than they should have been, i have also seen it with my own eyes. Since i have noticed this, our relationship has deteriorated a lot, to the point that we are fighting every weekend, and during the week because he is always wanting to go to his friends house (who is this girl is brother). Today, he has been really angry and agro at me. He has told me to go away and that he has been avoiding me on purpose. I feel like if we broke up my life would be ruined. I feel like i need him to survive. Every time we have come close to breaking up, it ends up me begging him not to leave. We live together which makes things harder. I have no friends left because i was so dependant on him and they got sick of me not seeing them. It is easy to say break up with him, but if you understood how attached i am you would know its not so easy. I do not know what to do. I think he is cheating on me but i need him .. does anyone have any advice? I am lost .. I do not know what to do anymore.","I have been with my partner for 2 years and in that time i have come to depend on him for a lot of things - everyday things like making phone calls for me etc.

"I went to this meeting. It was for people who have depression. The leader said to me that I was so knowledgeable I should be well. I was very sick at the time. Which went to show me I had knowledge but no wisdom. For years I knew this. I read all the books and nothing changed. I really felt like maybe I was on the wrong line of thought to get over the depression. Yet I did feel better. I thought my life is not changing though. I have so many hopes and dreams for my life and here I am sitting around wasting it. I still feel like that at times but then something bad happened and I did not react to it. I did not feel worse. Then someone did something stupid and I did not yell at them. I went to a friend and asked if she thought I was getting better. Her answer was. Hell Yeah. You bother to talk to me now. It seems she was doing all the talking at one stage. I did not know. It is been 10 years since I first got depressed In all the tests on the computer it went from severe depression to moderate the other day I got mild depression. Ok today its back to moderate. I think the reason for this is that I am nearly there with a thought process and I just cannot get it. I am kicking myself for it for being incompetent and those words from that woman came back you have all this knowledge you should be better. Do I need to go back and do some stuff on self esteem again? Is this what this is about. I look inside of me and see my self esteem has fallen apart again .. and I mean again! How many times is this? 100? a 100 times? Why cannot I work this out? I do not know what is wrong. I think if she asked me now, I would tell her, I have not got all the answers yet. Somehow I wished she was right. That with what I knew I could just be better. I am off to hit the books. Is not depression ironic? You can feel bad about anything even a compliment. By the way. I am still procrastinating. It is better though. I think. Not that much though I have so much to do. OK that is wrong is not it? I am heading to the quiet of my bedroom to study. I hope.","I really felt like maybe I was on the wrong line of thought to get over the depression.

"The base is 3 bound boxes of Remerol tablets (similar to Effexor). Above that is my trusty 300 mg slow release wellbutrin. Next, Sonata for occasional use; and then onto concerta per my request. Finally there is Risperdal and Topemax - a headache medication. I tried to kill myself last spring and came very, very close. This event has opened up spiritual dimensions more terrible than I thought possible. Forgive me for sounding weird, but with my life just one little hop, one small step away from obliteration, the return back became a long journey. And most of me did not even make it back - after the attempt I was hospitalized on a ward with a sociopath as my neighbor. I was naive and even befriended him. Far too late in the relationship I realized that this person may not have my best interests in hand. So I left the hospital but I left beaten. Then I went home to my family and some of them reacted terribly against my illness. I felt powerless, like I was spreading some miserable disease. My struggle goes on but at least I am alive.

"I was sexually, physically, and emotionally abused by my father, my uncle and my grandparents from the time I was five until I was fifteen. My mother had taken my father and his family to court for it but everyone said that she made me say it to get back at my father, since I was ""only five"" and ""not old enough to know anything."" None of them were punished for it and I had to keep seeing them on visitations until I was sixteen (i am still sixteen) and I told my dad I did not want to see him anymore. This obviously did not make him happy and he knows it is about the abuse. Every once and awhile he emails me or calls and tries to make me feel guilty about it and when he does I get upset all over again just when I had started to seem to get better. I really wanted to write a book about my life, but I figured that because my dad and his family was not punished or proven guilty that I would be sued for it. I want to change my last name and then get a pen name, but my mom says I have to wait until I am eighteen. I do not exactly want to wait that long to write my book, but I feel like I do not have a choice. I have considered taking them back to court but I figured it is probably hopeless and I feel guilty and doubtful even though I know it happened. Anyways, I do not want to put my mom through all that again. A lot of times I think that I imagined it all and deny it because I wish it did not happen. I really want to be a writer and to help people who have been abused, but without proving my abusers guilty I feel as if this is impossible, that it is not my right. I am scared they would be found innocent and then try to kill me for taking them to court. What should I do? I know everyone here is having a hard time and I really do not mean to be a bother. I feel guilty just talking about it because there are so many others who have had the same thing happen to them but I really needed advice.","I have considered taking them back to court but I figured it is probably hopeless and I feel guilty and doubtful even though I know it happened.

"If you care, will you read? My depression has gotten really bad over the last 2 years, and today I realized something. I do not have anyone. Everyone I talk to, people I would call 'friends' do not really care. They only notice me when I am the one who talks first. I make plans with them, set up so much and help everyone around me, but none of them care. I skipped school to see what would happen, and nothing. No one even noticed.

"Hi everybody. New member have been lurking for a while thought I would introduce myself. My name is Phil, have had depression all my life or as far back as I can recall. Why is it so hard to admit to yourself that you even have it? Any way I have been looking on internet for some info and come across this site which looks very friendly and inviting. I am taking citalopram at present and waiting to see a psychologist but she says I am not ready for her help which is very frustrating she says I would not be able to function if she started therapy with me. I work full time so I guess it is for the best. I am beginning to understand about depression a bit more now it would be nice to here from anybody out there who has suffered from depression and have found practical ways to deal with it.

"A bad relationship and my current state of mind I am 21 and i am going to share some of my experience. So, i meet this girl on the internet in my later 17 is , i was an active practitioner of Karate Kyokushin, Muay Thai and Box back then, i was about to enter in the amateurs and start to compete, i even went to japan 2 times on the championship and training grounds. Then, i meet this one girl , i had just left an relationship with another girl that end up with her cheating on me and well..i was even younger than now and i knew it how to fight, so..I beat the crap out of the guy and was disgusted by woman and by fighting like that again , i was so frustrated that i was traded by a 14 old boy (geez) but i overcome that. When i meet this girl (I would call her Kim from now on) i was clear about all that situation and that i was not up for a relationship with her or anyone else. She was earning a place in my heart because Kim seems so different from other girls and was treating me well, she respected my hobbies, my dreams (it was 5 months to 18 years and i was going to join the military because IT WAS MY DREAM) and myself as a ' aman''. So, she visited me, i visited her, we were 2 states of distance of each other, but ''never too far to our love do not reach each other'' bullshit (387 Miles) and of couse we started to dating and have sex, and all the vows of love, you guys know what i am talking.. Then i was on my 18, i had finished a test if i was join the military as a seargent or if i was enter like a corporal and I WAS SUCEED \o/ . But on the other hands, Kim, that i had met 6 months ago was through a rough part of her life, she had lost her job, she was not paying the bills and was about to get dumped from the house she was living (all alone) and then, i talked to my parents if i could help her by inviting her to come home with us, i was about to change my life, i was about to work twice as hard and so i did. I called her and say ''Hey, just sell your things, do not worry about it, we are gonna buy new ones baby'' Hell yea, like a fucking Alpha and she was so happy and she cried and she was all ''omg i love u so much'' Then i left all my trainings hobbies which gives me a lot of stress but i had back then a ' amajor reason '' for that and i was happy with her. Then Kim is past started to show up to us. A family of 5, me, my little brother, my mom and dad and now Kim. The thing is, Kim had a daughter that was with her aunts back then and she started to say she missed her, she was sad, she was feeling bad because she could not find a job yet (3 months had passed, it was a rough time on the Brazil enonomically speaking)but HEY, i had 2 jobs and i would not give up, she was sad that i had to work so hard to : 1- Help my parents 2- ""Pay"" For her in the house. I was saving money too, because other than spending money with that 2 things i did not have the time to do other things so some free time i had we would watch a movie, take some ice cream, have sex (a lot, geez) and that money that i was saving began to get bigger and bigger, till the point that i was thinking about buying some ground to maybe started to build our own house in the future when she get a job and started to help me . We would visit Kim is daughter from time to time and i start to love the girl, she was do damn smart but had a sadness in her that i could see, and one day in the house of Kim is Aunt, Her aunt came to me alone with Kim in the grocery store and started to say that i should stop my relationship with her. I was shocked by the comment, but cold as ice in the outside and just asked 'wth are u talking about ?"" then she started to say that Kim had beat her daughter so damn hard that almost killed her and that is why she was not with Kim anymore and she say Kim it is fckng crazy and all type of shit and i was pissed off. When we get back to home , i say to Kim what her aunt has spoken and she started to cry (and i was worried) and telled me a story (that is not even worth bring it here for u guys) that in fact was another person who beat her daughter. Well, time had passed, we did not talked about it anymore and we were hanging out and she turns to me and say ""What about we did a lil shot ? "" (That is the equivalent on Brazilian to ""LET'S SMELL COCAINE)i was ""What ?"" and she ""Yea, it will be fun, i will let you do it in my sexy belly if you want"" . It is unbelievable how someone so damn pretty and hot and smart and intelligent and perfect could turn into a fucking piece of shit so god damn fast. I refuse the ''offer'' and started to yell at her and started to talk some monstruous shit about it, like ""it was because of that you daughter almost died ?"" and everything, i was pissed off, sayed some shits that i should not , she say it too but we overcome it. So, i was with Kim about 2 years by now AND THEN SHE FINALLY GETS A JOB. we had moved on from my parents house a long time ago but i was not happy because Kim is past started to bother me. In that time i discovery somethings new about her (with 100% sure before you ask) : 1- She did sex for money , even when she knew me and just talked to me back then. 2- Her ex was a asshole that was aprisioned . 3- She lied as fuck to me about almost everything, her life, her family (like ""my dad is dead"" type of lie), her past, her path. But this is past RIGHT ? right ? maybe i should just 'fuck off' and get back to my parents house but love is a sick joke. Let is advance some months (10), we had a baby. She is the reason that i am here typing this now for you guys read it, because if not, it was for me being burned in hell for suicide. She of couse, hid the pregnancy , tried to abort EVEN WITH ME BEING BY HER SIDE, lied to me about birth control pills yea, but fuck it i was a man and i for sure would not let my daughter be aborted , she then tried to give her for adoption and was all about ""she will trouble us, our life"" and i was about to kick her out from the house get my baby and that is it. My parents started to help me but the damage was made it already and it was about to get worst. She was my bride and guess what ? Yea, she cheat on me. I understand that sometimes i was a dick but man i was not up to be a cuck. I went crazy again, but i controled myself, i send her back to her state with 2 K of money from my own (she quited her job with 2 months of pregnancy ) . I was so god damned hurt. Cheat on me with my best friend clich ? Wow. Then i started to think about it, he had a great body because he almost live in the gym because he did not work and did not have a family . But she doing that ? That hurt me a lot more than he doing it. And i was only 20 back there. She find another guy, and seems like I am now the aprisioned guy addicted to drugs (like her aunt had telled me ) you know ? I am so fucking sad. I loved this girl so fucking much , i wish so fucking much to had a life with her, with her daughter, with my daughter. She left and did not even ask about our daughter. You know how sad this is ? On the other hand, i am so frustrated about womans and so sad that every girl that i start to like i dump her because i do not want to delay her life like KIm did to me. I am fucking scared of relationships, i am fucking scared of girls , i am fucking terrified by the idea of trust anyone else then my father and my mother. i am not feeling like a man anymore, i am feeling like shit. BUT i started to train again in Muay Thai and i am enjoying it. but i feel so fucking lone because i really do everything alone. My workout, go eat some pizza, walk in a park.. i am so alone. Well, i stopped to take drugs to feel better , i stopped with almost everything and started to go to gym and for now that is working, i am just hope that someday in the future maybe..

"Hi everyone. I am a 26 yrold mom of three, 6 and under. My depression started as a teenager, but somehow back then I was able to ""talk myself out of it"" and perhaps had enough going on to keep me distracted. I got married right after high school, and nine months later, (overnight, really) became a mom. I never intended to be a mom at nineteen. I had dreamed of going to college, enjoying years of freedom with my husband, and then, carefully ""planning"" our first child. Well, seven years later, we have planned only one (our last), and strangely enough my only planned child was the hardest to recover from emotionally. After the birth of my first child I struggled with denial over all my crushed dreams, and fought back depression and suicide on a daily basis. I saw a psychiatrist who put me on various medicines over the next few months, to no significant improvement. When my daughter was three months old I was voluntarily committed to a behavioral health facility and stayed there four days. I came out fully charged, and within a matter of days, was right back where I started. So I started seeing a therapist who did me little good, and continued on the latest medicine combination I was prescribed. Shortly after my daughter turned one I finally gave up on the medicines and the therapy and pretended to be better, even though I was not, because of the sheer frustration that nothing was ""helping"" so I might as well just get on with life. I continued to battle depression and suicide on a daily basis, and also struggled with behavior that was contrary to what a good mother should be. My husband was military, and it is during times in his absence that I have become ""her"", my alter ego, someone who is intolerant, impatient, selfish, and ugly towards my kids. And blah, blah, blah. Do you guys get tired of telling your life story, because I do. I have lost count of how many times I have told it to various therapists in some vain attempt to help them understand me. So let me tell you where I am now. I am a person who is deeply confused. On the one hand I dearly love my kids, my husband, and I have the desire to live life and see my children grow and strengthen my relationship with them and my husband. On the other hand, I am sapped of every last ounce of purpose, life becomes extremely monotonous, and I strain to see the point of it all. Even now, as I write this, I am wondering, ""why am I wasting my time? These people will never know one tenth of a percent of what is going on inside me."" And that is how I have left every therapy session I have ever gone to, feeling like my time was utterly wasted and like I have made a chicken scratch in an issue solid as ice and twenty feet deep. I balance on a fragile thread of life and death and I am scared that it is only a matter of time before something tips the balance just far enough that I finally do ""it"". My biggest fear is that by the time I find a way to heal myself, if I make it that far, my kids will have paid the ultimate price and be a product of confusion and sadness too. I am sick and tired of trying to feel human. In talking with others, I feel intangible, fake, this intellect in human form but incapable of human understanding. My emotions are real; love, hate, empathy, grief, anger, happiness, but I still do not feel ""real"". I feel like I am missing some vital component that ties it all together, and without it, I am nothing more than this body walking around, emulating those around me, operating on some kind of autopilot. It goes beyond frustration and confusion, and I feel this pent up rage building inside of me, and I want to scream at the top of my lungs until I turn blue, throw a chair through a window, send dishes crashing to the floor, something through which I can channel the anger and get it as far from me as possible. And then, sorrow. Black as an abyss, tormenting hopelessness, and it is then that I contemplate suicide. Fortunately (or not) I will then remember something, some reason for why I cannot do it. The other day was my sisters birthday. I did not want her to have to remember her birthday as the day her sister killed herself. Then I bawl, because there is no way out. I cannot leave, and staying means continued torment for me and the people I love, and for some reason, love me. How long must I endure this cycle? Once again I am off medication. After the birth of my third child I went on the latest wonder drug, Lexapro, and after a year with no improvement I have abandoned that as well. I also made another mental health check in when the baby (now 1 1/2) was a few months old, for six days in duration, and once again came out feeling like a hundred bucks only to crash again. I have examined the perspective that, like the books title, ""Depression is a Choice"", and have even embraced the idea. I have also embraced the idea that it is certainly not a choice, and that medication is the solution, with equally unhelpful results. I grow weary of this fruitless search to ""fix myself"". For those of you who would suggest God, yes I am a believer. I turned to him three years ago, after years of Agnosticism, in utter desperation to fill in the ""missing link"". But for whatever reason, He still is not enough. Which is the biggest blow of all, because I truly comprehend the sacrifice that was made in my behalf with the Atonement, and yet for some reason fail to utilize it. So here I am. One big mess. And I am joining the group, lucky you! See you around","After the birth of my first child I struggled with denial over all my crushed dreams, and fought back depression and suicide on a daily basis.
When my daughter was three months old I was voluntarily committed to a behavioral health facility and stayed there four days.
Shortly after my daughter turned one I finally gave up on the medicines and the therapy and pretended to be better, even though I was not, because of the sheer frustration that nothing was ""helping"" so I might as well just get on with life.
On the one hand I dearly love my kids, my husband, and I have the desire to live life and see my children grow and strengthen my relationship with them and my husband.
These people will never know one tenth of a percent of what is going on inside me."" And that is how I have left every therapy session I have ever gone to, feeling like my time was utterly wasted and like I have made a chicken scratch in an issue solid as ice and twenty feet deep.
I balance on a fragile thread of life and death and I am scared that it is only a matter of time before something tips the balance just far enough that I finally do ""it"".
My biggest fear is that by the time I find a way to heal myself, if I make it that far, my kids will have paid the ultimate price and be a product of confusion and sadness too.
It goes beyond frustration and confusion, and I feel this pent up rage building inside of me, and I want to scream at the top of my lungs until I turn blue, throw a chair through a window, send dishes crashing to the floor, something through which I can channel the anger and get it as far from me as possible.

"For some reason .. I am never happy anymore .. It all started a little less than a year ago. Suicide attempts, cutting, burning, hair pulling, slapping, basically just wanting to die. People tell me my life is not that bad just because my family has money. Money is not everything. Also, everyone spreads rumors about me, and tells me crap to my face!! My boyfriend is really sweet and I LOVE him, but he has a serious anger issue! His psychologist diagnosed him with an anger issue. And lately when he gets frustrated, he sometimes hits me. Not like REALLY hard, but hard enough to leave a mark. Then later he does not remember doing it. I am worried about him, and myself. I do not want our relationship to end because of our problems. And none of my friends understand why I cut and stuff. It is not always for attention you know!! So, if someone could please email me at xx. Or reply. That would be great.

"I die a little inside with every customer (TW) Let me start by saying I have been getting help for chronic depression and anxiety since January. I take sertraline (50mg) every day, and it is helped me tremendously. I was hired as a cashier at a fast food job in November of last year, and it was a huge step forward. No education, no GED, no transportation, no job experience (except for working for a family company since I was a literal child); needless to say, I felt like I overcame a hump that had been looming in front of me for quite some time. I have had extreme social anxiety since my early teens, so diving headfirst into a cashier job seemed a bit counter-intuitive. Now, I do not know if it was the medication or simply having no choice but to face my fears every day, but the anxiety has completely faded. Gone. Zilch. Good, right? Well, in its place, a little seedling sprouted, and as time goes by it swells inside my heart and head, pushes against my skull, crushes my organs, my spark, my will to move forward. I hate people so fucking much. I am so damn tired of hearing you complain that the price of a sandwich has increased by fifty fucking cents. I am so damn tired of cleaning up after your little brats after they throw their food on the floor. I am so fucking fed up with you cancelling an entire fucking order, after it was already prepared, because the soda machine was out of cherry Fanta. What the fuck is wrong with you? I go home and utterly dread the next day of picking up the slack of my coworkers and dealing with a shitload of entitled, spoiled assholes. Every now and then, there is an angel. Someone who is not a total asshole to me..it could be something so small to you, but it can make my entire day that much easier. Perhaps you already know what you want to order, and do not hold up a line of ten people because you are picky as fuck. Perhaps you tip me 96 cents. Usually, it is treating me like I am a feeling, thinking human instead of the shit on your heel. I bend over backwards for these people and do my best to let them know that they are truly appreciated. I have come so far, and yet I am so close to giving up. It is wearisome forcing a smile every day and powering through as if I have a promising future, when I do not. I pretend that I do not slice my thighs with razors, that I am not covered in self harm scars, that all is well. I pretend I do not fantasize every day about diving headfirst in front of a semi truck. I pretend the love of my life and best friend is not homeless and is not living in a tent with a heroin addict. I pretend, I pretend, I pretend. I am so tired.","Now, I do not know if it was the medication or simply having no choice but to face my fears every day, but the anxiety has completely faded.

"I am too much of a coward to even kill myself I am posting this here, not primarily to garner attention or sympathy, but because I have nowhere else to turn and I do not know what to do with myself. I also want to try and combat some of the embarrassment and shame that I feel in regards to being clinically address, so perhaps voicing what I am thinking here, it could potentially be therapeutic for me. Now that is out of the way,this might get quite long, so I will put a tldr at the end of this. Context: I am a 20 year old girl. My whole life, my sense of worth was dictated around whether I could make the people around me happy. I had extremely strict and controlling parents and so I had no real sense of worth other than the fact that at least I did not harbour any malicious feelings towards anyone, or try and hurt anybody deliberately. I had normal teenage 'angst' and moody, brooding periods, but absolutely not depression at all. I was completely, for want of a better word, normal. In April 2017, I first had feelings of depression, when I realised how badly I had hurt someone who used to be very important in my life. (it is an extremely long story and I am slightly more at peace with it now so I do not feel the need to explain because it would take forever). I was incapicitated for a week, I would cry constantly, not leave my bed, and my mum would scream at me and tell me she wouldid not have time to deal with my shit'. However I had a REASON for feeling this down, so whether this was the start of a biological depression, I am not quite sure. Fast forward to October 2017. This is where my current situation and problems begin. I am currently studying abroad in Japan- something I have been envisioning and looking forward to for 10 years. Honestly, I had been constantly dreaming about this for an extremely long time. It was what I felt my life was gearing towards, everything led to this. However, it all went downhill. My host family is incredibly lovely, I had made a couple friends on social media before even joining the university, and there were so many intercultural exchange opportunities to join. Yet, despite this, I could feel my mood slipping gradually. I have always been a shy person and not good with strangers, but I began to feel a creeping anxiety looming up on me, that told me to not bother others, that by interacting with others I was causing them inconvenience and discomfort, and the best thing for me to do was to just be alone. I partly attribute it to the fact I had a really awful teacher in my first semester here. Now, I think some people might think that this might be a cultural shock issue, but I am pretty sure that she was crossing ANY acceptable line, no matter what culture. Firstly she would be very rude to me in front of all my classmates. Say if I came in without makeup, in jeans (like, still showered, hair done, not sweatpants or anything, just not completely dolled up) she would say in front of everyone 'Your face is not pretty enough to not wear any makeup. You are scaring everyone. You know girls in Japan care about their appearance. You should do too, for everyone is sake'. (Also my Japanese is perfectly adequate to understand interactions like that, so I know for a fact that this was not a language barrier issue. ) If I got a question wrong in class she would say 'You know, I do not know why I bother asking planyourspontaneity for answers, she is so useless'. Or if we had to make example sentences she would pick examples like 'What does planyourspontaneity need? Oh planyourspontaneity needs to learn how to make some friends'. And this became like a running joke in my class. I have never been bullied, so I never learnt to grow a thick skin, so this (what felt like) daily victimisation began to really grate and tear down my self esteem. I felt isolated so my social anxiety caused me to isolate myself, and people ignoring me, creating a vicious circle. I began to be completely mute in class, ignoring the teacher, be on my phone, having headphones in, and this obviously spurred her on as she would berate me for how I was a terrible student. Also I feel like it might be relevant to say how I told this teacher that the reason why I was so withdrawn and using my phone a lot was because my stepfather was undergoing cancer treatment and I was worried (this was true). But she still kept calling me useless and nothe worst student I have ever taught' to everyone. If I seemed withdrawn though she would stroke my thighs and lower back and neck (I think this contact thing might be a cultural difference but still) in front of everyone, which obviously made them think I was a total freak. If I made eye contact with them, they would quickly shuffle away or look disgusted. Around November-ish time I began to suffer with very extreme bouts of depression. I felt awfully ashamed- here I was living the dream I had longed for for about a decade, and I was here for some reason feeling absolutely dreadful. Even if I had had a fun day, I still had this lingering sadness, and I would get home and cry. I started seeing a counsellor which was one of the best decisions (or rather, my long distance boyfriend decided for me) I ever made. In December time it reached the point where I would barely go to class because the idea of seeing people, going to class, and even just getting out of my bed just seemed overwhelmingly difficult to me. I would cry all the time, tug my hair and cut my forearms, and would call the suicide hotline. My teacher emailed me numerous times, all very inappropriately about how her parents were dying to and how I should turn to God (not that I do not think that that is a viable avenue for some people, it just seemed like weird advice from my teacher) I tried going on anti depressants (Escitalopram?) but they made me vomit after just one pill so I stopped straight away. I travelled with my long distance boyfriend who came to Japan to see me, and felt nothing. Then I went to Nagano with my host family, and felt some kind of peace, and calmness. This calmness and general mellowness resided in me for some time, until now. Current situation: My depression came back with a vengeance yesterday during the day. At lunch time I locked myself into the bathrooms to cry and cry. I took a tranquilliser that had been prescribed for me during bouts of extreme depression to curb the urge to self harm and it did nothing. I hate myself so much. This exchange, this is what I wanted my life to lead up to, and my fucking brain is ruining it all for me. Aside from this, I had nothing to look forward to in my life. I just want to be happy, I want for people to not hate me. I know most people hate me because of the way they act around me, they will not invite me to any class activities even if I am right there, and I will be the only one not in the class group chat, class karaoke nights, etc etc. Literally the only one. I am scared of going to intercultural lounges to interact with people because they all know each other from last semester, and I cannot even talk to people in real life in the first place. I just feel like an alien. I do not feel like I was meant to be born in this world at all. All I want is to be suddenly transported into a different world. I do not want to be here anymore. I just want to be asleep forever. I want to be dead. But I am scared of death. I wish I was religious so I had some motivation for either killing myself and going to heaven, or for fear of hell having motivation and stay alive. What if it hurts? What if the nothingness is unbearable? But I want to be dead. Every time I see a train go by I want to jump so badly. I know my boyfriend and family would be sad but they would get over it. He would get a better, non depressed girlfriend so he does not have to deal with my shit anymore. My dad has a new daughter he treats better than he ever did me. My mum would be devastated but I do not know if I can hold on just for her sake. Anyway, I know I am not such a loss to the world. If anything, the vast majority of people in the world would be happy because they would not have to interact with me. I have nothing to offer anyone and my existence is just a waste and if I am not happy why should I even be here. I wish I could gather up the courage to just do it and end it all but I am a coward and I am scared Thank you for reading, sorry for taking up your time.","My whole life, my sense of worth was dictated around whether I could make the people around me happy.

"Well, I have never cut before .. I have been tempted, but I am so afraid that someone will notice and ask questions .. I do not want to talk about it ..

"I find the word ""crippling depression"" very true. But I think it is also a vicious cycle. Anyone have ever done this? It is like you stay in bed or sit around because you feel depressed. And then your feet kind of go numb and it makes you feel worse. It is like a vicious cycle. We are supposed to be using our limbs. We are not statues. Anyone ever tried walking around all day keeping sitting minimum? What are the effects? I am thinking of trying it tomorrow. I will just try standing around or walking around all day in my house.","It is like you stay in bed or sit around because you feel depressed.

"I finally came out to my close friends that I have depression, and now I am being alienated because I am ""not mentally stable"" Probably a rant, but what the fuck. This last college semester was horrible on me, and I came out of it with depression and depression meds. I am 19M in college right now. I thought it was pretty obvious, but I wanted to tell my friends about why I have been talking less and have been hermitting myself out a little. So the next time we are all together, I tell them that I have depression and that is why I am taking meds and that is why I have gotten so quiet, ect. And.. Barely any response. Basically just some ""oh, ok.."" Like really? But it get is better. So the night after I tell them, I get a message from one of my ""friends"", whom I was going to room with next year. The message said, and I can quote, that they ""do not feel safe around a mentally dark person"" in their house. Ok, what? Even better, the convo goes on and says that my group of friends were talking.. And they do not want to, in quotes again, ""Associate with a mentally dark person"" as a friend. Like what the fuck? It is been a week and they have lived up to it. Suddenly I am not getting invited anywhere or anything. If I am with my friends (I still try to hang out), I will get heavily ignored. Like what the fuck, my depression has now gotten so much worse. I want to ditch every single one of them, but I honestly do not have any other close friends outside of this group. I am trying my best to find new friends, and if that happens, I will happily leave these people who consider depression sufferers ""dark and unstable and unsafe"". Just needed to rant Edit: Also thank you for all the hug PMs they really do help ;-; Edit 2: Wow this blew up, in my point of view anyways. I am going to talk to them, and cut out whoever is still toxic about it.

"I just feel trapped I am finishing up my Masters degree and just feel hopeless right now. I hate school. I am starting to hate my field of study too. I play the trumpet. But to be honest, I am not very good at it. High notes, any other trumpet player will be able to understand. In the past two years, my playing has underwent some other terrible thing where I hesitate at the start of anything I play. It is 100 percent mental. I have made some strides in it, but it still comes back. For the past two years, it has made me feel like I cannot even play a simple fucking melody to someone if asked. Trumpet is basically my adventure, but it seems like I just cause myself pain. I want to keep working on it, but boy it hurts my soul to suck and to keep not doing well. On top of that, I struggle with my weight. I love fast food. I know it is bad, but I use it to cope. I also would love to stop watching porn. I am addicted to that. I have been addicted to that since I was probably in the 4th grade. I just feel trapped, like I do not have the self control or am not smart enough to discipline myself to fix these problems. I am just sick of being a loser in life. Is there any hope?","I play the trumpet.

No big deal I am pretty used and expect people to drift out of my life. I know people who I used to be friends with but now we are just accquantences, we do not talk at all but follow each other on social media. But here is the thing, when you post things on social media about how you are ready to kill your self or how depressed you are and you do not even get a text asking if you are okay- does that mean no one cares? I see them caring about other people but they never seen to make sure if I am okay. I mean I do not expect them to, but I know when I see people that I care about talking like that I need to make sure that they are okay. I mean, how can you say you are friends with someone but not even say anything when they are threatening to kill the selves. It is weird, you will be Sauk g how much you want to die and how depressed you are and no one will say anything BUT they will make sure to send you a picture on Snapchat to keep the streak lol.

"I have never talked about this to anyone I have struggled with depression since I was in 2nd grade. For the last 7 years it is gotten worst, I am 20 at the moment. When I was 13 I was raped occasionally. Being raped when it first happen did not bother me as much because I didnt understand what was happening until years later. What did bother me at the time was that I felt alone. I have always felt alone, never felt like anyone cared for me or about me. I fought with my mom and step dad a lot which made me feel even more lonely. I never talked about feeling lonely to anyone because I was always embarrassed about it and still do. Because me and my parents had a rocky relationship I would be abused by both at times. One time I was arguing with my mom and she ended up getting a 2 by 4 and started hitting me with it. I never rasied my hands at my parents, just talked a lot of shit and was an asshole to them. My parents kicked me out of their house when I was 14. I ended up living with my grandpa. This made me feel unwanted and even more lonely now that my parents gave up on me. I lived with my grandpa for about 9 months before he sent me back to my parents because he could not ""afford"" to keep me. I was not an asshole to my grandpa nor was I mean to him, I just was a teen who stayed up late and took long showers. My grandpa giving up on me was heartbreaking for me. I felt like no one wanted me and if I ended everything then everything would be better. I did not even last a week at my parents house, they shipped me off to live with some family who lived in the rural country area instead of the city. I lived there for maybe 4 months and finished my freshmen year of high school there. I did not feel welcomed anywhere I went and for the most part I felt more beyond alone. Majority of the time at my uncle is I was in my room, alone and desperate for a friend. After 4 lonely months of really being alone I was given back to my parents again. After coming home broken I learned to keep to myself. No one wanted me and no one cared. When I got back home I was sent to an all boy high school. Once again I had to go to a new school and try to fit in somehow. I was lonely for a while until I met this girl. I am afraid to write her name incase she ever reads this and it hurts reading/writing it but I need to get this off my chest. I met this beautiful girl named Cindy at a school function. She went to the all girl school down a couple streets. Both all gender schools would make events for each other to get students that social interaction. Anyways I meet this beautiful girl named Cindy, she was nice to me and I was nice to her. We dated for over a year and while it lasted it was nice. The way she broke up with me literally broke me. I was having a really sad day and told her about how I struggle with really bad depression and that I have suicidal thoughts. Her response was ""oh"" and she slowly stopped talking to me. Eventually she stopped talking to me and when she did talk to me she made excuses about not having time to talk to me. She was my only friend, the only person I was close to. She could not be there for me when I needed her most, when I needed a friend most. So I stayed alone thinking maybe school was too much for her at the moment. Then one day I get on Facebook only to see her on it, I clicked on her page and saw that she had been on hanging out with friends and having the time of her life. She slowly broke me, I could not handle it and called her to confront her about it. She made excuses and talked about how she didnt have time for me at the moment, so she hung up and left it alone. I was reaching my breaking point, I was going to commit suicide. I sent her a text message talking about how I needed her to talk to me and be a friend because I was getting worst. She never responded to me however she did get in contact with my school to let them know what I was dealing with. I was so embarrassed that she did this to me, I felt betrayed and hurt that she made me the schools problem instead of hers. It hurt ne so bad. I was embarrassed that the school knew, I was embarrassed that my parents knew now. I wanted to kill myself more than ever now. I was so hurt by this and was angry at Cindy. I went home and tried stabbing myself. My mom went in my room to talk to me, just so happened at that moment I had a kitchen knife in my hand to stab myself. My mon fought me over it and sent me to a psychiatric hospital. I stayed there until December 23rd. At the hospital I tried killing myself twice. First time was when the guards/residents give you cracks, I ate the crackers but stuffed the wrapper down my throat. One if the residents heard me making choking nosies and came in to save me. Second time was when I started swallowing my food instead of chewing on it to choke me out again. They put me on these medications that did not help but I acted like they did so I can go home. I was alone again, Cindy stopped talking to me. It broke my heart and broke me. It is been 4 years since Cindy and I am not over it. It still kills me about what happened. I am still depressed and suicidal. I honestly wish I did kill myself when I had the courage to do so. There has not been much for me other than pain. I have not moved on and I have not gotten over everything. This was my deepest darkest moment in my life so far. I wish I could say things got better for me since all of that but true is they have not. I am still the same lonely person I have always felt I have been for the longest time. I have tried dating in college and I have never had feelings for anyone. Do not have many friends and do not have any real reasons to be here still. I am just waiting on that one thing to break me down to give me courage. If you read this thank you. Im sorry I made you read a lot and I am sorry that I am this way. I will get better one day but not soon.","What did bother me at the time was that I felt alone.
I never talked about feeling lonely to anyone because I was always embarrassed about it and still do.
I never rasied my hands at my parents, just talked a lot of shit and was an asshole to them.
I lived with my grandpa for about 9 months before he sent me back to my parents because he could not ""afford"" to keep me.
I felt like no one wanted me and if I ended everything then everything would be better.
I lived there for maybe 4 months and finished my freshmen year of high school there.
When I got back home I was sent to an all boy high school.
I met this beautiful girl named Cindy at a school function.
Eventually she stopped talking to me and when she did talk to me she made excuses about not having time to talk to me.
So I stayed alone thinking maybe school was too much for her at the moment.
She made excuses and talked about how she didnt have time for me at the moment, so she hung up and left it alone.
I sent her a text message talking about how I needed her to talk to me and be a friend because I was getting worst.
I was so embarrassed that she did this to me, I felt betrayed and hurt that she made me the schools problem instead of hers.
My mom went in my room to talk to me, just so happened at that moment I had a kitchen knife in my hand to stab myself.
I am still the same lonely person I have always felt I have been for the longest time."
"i can only do so many intro is, then i get real sick of talking (writing) about me. i have depression/anxiety. I am not medicated, and though the va would provide medicines, I am done with them for now. Now that I have not homeless anymore i have the stability to get proper rest and nutrition, which have been sorely lacking. I have just started taking vitamins, and though i did get a membership to the ymca to work out, I have yet to bottle up the anxiety enough to go in. i used to love being in the gym, now it is available, and I am frozen to my apartment. it will come.

"anyone who can offer me advice on this it would be amazing! my girlfriend is the greatest girl I have ever met, i love her and want to marry her eventually. Here is my problem though: she is still in high school. and ever since i moved away to university i have been constantly constantly worrying about things i cannot control. like when she drinks with her friends, and whether or not I will still love her in a month, whether or not she is going to suddenly ask herself ""what am i doing in a long distance relationship anyway?"". these are all ridiculous things to worry about. not only because she loves me to the ends of the earth, but because i have ZERO control over them. these worries are driving me insane and slowly ripping up our relationship. does anyone have any advice to offer?",does anyone have any advice to offer?
"I am not worth it I just do not feel like I am worth anyone is time or effort, and I just feel like a burden to everyone. I have a part time job (anywhere between 20-39 hours a week) and I am at college (in the UK &amp; I am 18)and I am constantly tired. My mum is such a lovely person, but I really do feel like she would be better off without me, she is always complaining how she never has time to do anything (she works 30 hours a week + she always cooks + cleans up after my stepdad and brother but complains about any mess I have made) and I am lazy, messy and I quite often ruin her day. But I am sure I have ruined her whole life. She had me when she was 19, which meant she had to quit her job because she could not afford childcare and she had an abusive step-dad, who would refuse to let her mum look after me, and she also fell out with her very religious grandparents as she was not married (they have since made up). She then could not get a job until I started school (which is actually a decent job). At this new job, she met my step-dad (after a few years) and they have since had a child together (who also does not seem to like me one bit). My step dad seems to hate me more than my mum does, but I cannot complain because neither of them are abusive, and this is one of my problems; I feel like I should not moan about anything in my life; I live in a decent sized 3 bedroom house, I have an education and I also have a job. Whilst my mum lived with her abusive step-dad, was forced to quit college (so she could get a job to start paying rent) and was also forced to baby sit whilst her parents went out drinking every other night. Yet here I am, never feeling happy, without many friends (I talk to the people at work when I am there and I have 2 other friends that I speak to around twice a month, normally because there other friends are busy and they want to complain about their boyfriends, or because the other friend does not want to go shopping on her own ( another reason why I do not have a reason to be negative; she was in care and now classified as homeless as she is now 18 and not catered for in the care system, so now she has to live in temporary accommodation with lots of drug users in the same building.) I feel like I just ruin everything, if I am downstairs with my family, there always seems to be an argument, even if I am not involved in the argument. But if everyone else is in the living room, whilst I am upstairs in my own, I can only ever here them laughing and enjoying themselves. It is like, even when I have not done anything, I seem to just produce a negative atmosphere. I really do not want to be here anymore, if I disappeared, it would not really effect any one, my mum might be upset at first but she would quickly realise how much better her life is without me. The problem is that I am even too lazy and stupid to kill myself, so I am just secretly hoping that a medical issue that has been ongoing for a while (and I have not been to the doctor is in years because I would just be wasting their time, when they could be helping someone better than me) is serious, and nature will take its cause..","My mum is such a lovely person, but I really do feel like she would be better off without me, she is always complaining how she never has time to do anything (she works 30 hours a week + she always cooks + cleans up after my stepdad and brother but complains about any mess I have made) and I am lazy, messy and I quite often ruin her day.

"Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad? Well I often do, quite sometimes frankly. I just miss those good old days, when life was just so beautiful and easy. Nothing to worry about, nothing to cry for other than silly childish little things. My childhood was so beautiful. It was in France. It is been now a whole decade since I left France - the country I have always admired and will always do. I remember going to school, having so many friends, I felt like I am the happiest child on Earth. Then suddenly one day, everything changed. The passing of time took away from me my childhood, my friends, my beloved France. Life suddenly just changed like that. No more joy, no more innocence, no more real friends, no more homeland. No more beautiful sunny days, only darkness, depression, nostalgia and tears. I am trying to survive day by day through this hell on Earth. Each time those memories of my childhood flashbacks, I cannot help stopping the tears that drop from my eyes. Whenever someone mentions France, I get overwhelmed. I am living the hardest time of my life. A 10-year ""war in lifetime"", as I call it, still going on, and does not seem to have an end soon. I know those good old times are just memories, obviously. Tomorrow when I wake up, things will be just the same. But my hope will never die. My redemption will come, soon or late. This moment of my life will also be just memories, just like those good old days of my childhood in France. I did not go in detail 'cause I do not think many people will be interested in my story. But if you are, I would not mind sharing you the whole story, as long as you can share me yours. And how about you? Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad?","I just miss those good old days, when life was just so beautiful and easy.

"I want to share a personal project I am proud of A month ago I was feeling completely unmotivated to do anything. I was feeling that none of my connections with friends are as deep as they used to be, that I am not as close to my family as I used to be, that nothing I do at work really matters, and that my health is slowly deteriorating. I just wanted to quit at everything. Then I was hanging out with a friend I had not seen in a while, and he admitted to me that he had been struggling with depression, so we both opened up about it. He ended up recommending the book ""Feeling Good"" to me, since it had helped him improve a lot. I read it and was initially a bit disappointed.. some parts were underwhelming, some felt annoying/condescending, and the solution to every problem seemed to be the ""three-column technique."" But after trying a few of the exercises in the book, I admit it turned out to be somewhat helpful. One of the exercises/quizzes in the book is the ""Depression Checklist,"" which (as I am sure many of you are aware of) assesses your level of depression on a scale from 1 to 100. At the time, I was scoring in the ""Moderate"" range. After a couple weeks of applying some of the exercises, I was down to the ""Mild"" range. So I decided to create a project that might help me learn a bit more about myself, with regard to the effect of my daily habits on my level of depression. What I wanted to build was a simple web app that would let me score my productivity on a daily basis (based on exercising, reading, socializing, meditating, etc) and then plot that against my daily depression score. I wanted to see if there was a correlation between higher productivity and lower depression, or if certain activities had a greater impact on my mood. Ironically what I discovered was that working on the project itself was a huge mood-booster for me, since it gave me a sense of purpose and was a great outlet for creativity. As I have gotten further along in the work, I have noticed my depression level has slowly started rising again. But for a while, I was actually in the ""Normal"" range of depressive emotions! I could not believe it. Regardless, the project has also given me more insight into a few things that drastically help my mood. Even though my mood is not at the level it was a couple weeks ago, it is nice to know that investing in personal projects gives me a lot of satisfaction (Also if anyone is interested in trying out the app, feel free to check it out [here](). It is stupid simple and still a work in progress, but I am still kinda proud of it.. and if it were able to help even just one other person, that would make me pretty happy &lt;3)","I want to share a personal project I am proud of A month ago I was feeling completely unmotivated to do anything.

"Dropping by to mention you should take some Vitamin D supplements. Of course, check with your doctor. Etc. etc. Vitamin D is the sunshine pill that most people are deficient in. This is also much more of an issue in colder areas or for those who cover up from the sun often. The best way to get vitamin D is through certain food combinations and routines in sitting in delicate morning sunlight and in most cases, taking a supplement is necessary to keep this vitamin flowing in your body. Vitamin D is best absorbed with calcium, so if you are taking a supplement, finding foods, or sitting in the sun consider to add the calcium as well. You will find that your mood will be better or more stable with vitamin D consumption. Make sure to strive for a more regulated sleeping schedule as well and something to keep your mind stimulated without an electronic screen.

"Why my relationship is killing me Okay, disclaimer, former relationship.. but it still has a huge effect on my life. This girl was my best friend and my first serious relationship. I met her when I first got depressed, and we went to the same church together. I told her then that I did not feel ready for a relationship, but she essentially stalked me all those (5) years ago. Christmas 2016, after dealing with a crap load more grief and depression, I was essentially forced into a relationship with her. I had just got over my main stint of depression the previous September, and my life was getting better. We still hung out as friends, but she kept pushing for more. However, she is so messed up. I have to say that now. I do still love her, and that will probably never change, but she needs professional help, and my mistake was thinking I could help her. She was my best friend after all. So, after a string of breakups, moving too slow and moving too fast, as well as her cheating on my several times, she finally called it quits one week after my birthday (November just gone). I had no say, because she would throw a tantrum, but I had to take the initiative. Why? Because she no longer wanted to have my baby. In August, she fell pregnant. This could have been the week prior the Anniversary of our first kiss, but the nurse dated it on that specific date. That was one of the nights she cheated on me, with her friend is boyfriend, but it was ""just a kiss"". She tried to miscarry by drinking heavily for the next few weeks before coming to me about it; she had broken up with me the day after she cheated. I asked her there and then if she wanted to keep it. She said yes. We went to speak to my mum. My mum asked her. She said yes. She wanted to announce the pregnancy, to start all the planning, and looking forward to the future. I got a well paying job to provide for our future, a job I travelled hundreds of miles for each week, and it was only for a few months. But whilst I was away, she decided she missed all the drinking, drugs, and sex she was missing out on. She wanted to live with her friends (who she actually hates living with at times), and countless other reasons. However, she kept stringing me along until the scan, where she sent me a photo of our child before telling me she wanted to abort it. Oh, and I had planned a weekend away for us to relax and see some friends. She had me believe this was the start of my happy ever after, before ripping it away from me. She did not speak to me for two weeks. When I finally did manage to get in touch, it was to collect my stuff. I took a mutual friend with me, the act as a buffer, and they could not believe the stuff that she said to me. Then I get a load of hate off her because people are contacting her about her choices. Remember, she has been posting on FB all about the baby, making sure everyone knows. She has not spoken to me since. She has blocked me anyway she can, even on WhatsApp only recently.. not that it matters, because she wants nothing to do with me. This was my best friend, and my stalker, who for years wanted to be with me, have a family with me, worried I would not want her because of PCOS, and got jealous over people talking to me on Twitter, and kittens! She could not even handle me showing up with chocolates and flowers! All that I have done for her, supported her, sacrificed for her.. and this is how she treats me. Now, I am pro-life, and pro-choice. I gave her that choice, and she wanted to go ahead. I did not force her or convince her. She led me. She set me up, just to rip out my heart. Seriously, if you only knew the half of it. The card she wrote for me for my birthday alone would have anyone convinced. But now, she is living her life. She is out drinking, smoking, doing drugs and sleeping with anything she can get her claws into. She has restarted her YouTube ""career"", and quite frankly, they are boring videos. Maybe she will do better. I hope not. But I think that is normal. So why this post? Because it is killing me. I do not know how, but I am still kicking. Depression is creeping at my door, and I do have horrible days, bad days where I am so demotivated. Yet, I cannot stop thinking about her. She has me broken, in ruins.. even my faith has been hit hard. I do not understand what changed. I do not understand she did what she did. Why did she play me for so long just to hurt me? Everyone tells me to forget about her, and no one would allow me to go back to her (even if it was a possibility). All I want to do is to forget about her, because as the title says.. this relationship is killing me.","This girl was my best friend and my first serious relationship.
I had just got over my main stint of depression the previous September, and my life was getting better.
She was my best friend after all.
Because she no longer wanted to have my baby.
She tried to miscarry by drinking heavily for the next few weeks before coming to me about it; she had broken up with me the day after she cheated.
I asked her there and then if she wanted to keep it.
She wanted to live with her friends (who she actually hates living with at times), and countless other reasons.
I took a mutual friend with me, the act as a buffer, and they could not believe the stuff that she said to me.
not that it matters, because she wants nothing to do with me.

"Had one of those days where I really wanted to just get out of bed and be with people: hit up my friends and no one could hang out or seemed into it. Really brought me down, man. I feel like I give a lot and do not get a whole lot in return sometimes. And part of this is probably just egocentrism. I should not expect my friends to plan their day around me last minute, even though I told them I was feeling lonely. It just sucks because I feel like I would do anything for the people I care about, like I would drop anything to be there. I put those standards on other people and maybe that is wrong of me. Anyway, I just sat around with my pup and ate too much and watched tv so it is what it is.","It just sucks because I feel like I would do anything for the people I care about, like I would drop anything to be there."
"How can I get out of an almost constant state of dissociation? A majority of the time I am just in a state of dissociation. It is difficult for me to describe, but it is like I am just not mentally there. It is like a constant state of autopilot. I am there but my mind is not. My mind is always so foggy and difficult to navigate through. Most of the time, I am just mentally empty. I used to never be like this but I cannot remember what life was even like before this. It is been like this since I was 14. I am 19 now and I want to get out of it badly but I do not know how I can.","It is difficult for me to describe, but it is like I am just not mentally there.

"Well I am getting ready to go back to school so I am trying to get sober for a while and see i can clear my head. So far I have been sober for about days and i must say I am not feeling any better. Some of the problem is probably zyrtec which I am taking for my allergies but really i just feel really irritable and confused. i cannot really think too well and it is making me want to drink. Drinking slows down my mind somewhat so i can focus on things in my head. Normally its not till the next day after a good night of drinking that i feel good for most of the next day. i am more talkative and can come up with things much easier. There are people who use Prozac and other anti-depressant drugs not because they want it but because it makes them feel even better than they normally do. This is somewhat my issue with alcohol however i do not fell good normally i feel like s**t normally. i guess i should let u in on what is really bothering me. First ill just list the problems i have i find most worrying. Night blindness ""fuzzy vision"" bad sinus pressure moderate fatigue all the time short term memory problems random aches and pains major depression, anxiety, and ocd bad allergies acid reflux. To be honest most scary one is night blindness. Trying to explain is pretty difficult but ill try. It is like being able to see all the cons and rods and your eye flash on and off constantly kind of like a bad channel on a TV screen. I have had it for years now with no one who can really give me straight answer about it. i went to my doctor recently and got up the nerve to tell him but thought he gave me some good info he probably thought i was mad. Anyway one of the first things your body will do when it is over exerted is give u fuzzy vision. Now normally night blindness is caused be a vitamin A deficiency. Maybe there is something wrong with my stomach that is making me feel the way i am and i did have kidney stone when i was 2 which is very rare. i know this is a lot of information but this is what i deal with on a ""daily"" basis. My daily routine is almost exactly the same except on weekends when i do go out and drink with my friends. my will is low and energy just as low so i find myself kind of in and out of this trance that is supposed to be life. Each day i go to work, come home, eat, and up to my room for pretty much the rest of the night. do not get me wrong i do other things during the week sometimes but i feel most comfortable by myself in my room as opposed to human contact which sucks. So if i have to drink to keep from going over the deep end then i will do so until i get some real answers. If anyone has any answers I am all ears.","Drinking slows down my mind somewhat so i can focus on things in my head.

"I am just so fucking lonely and I am tired of pretending I am fine Fair warning I am about to just spill out everything I have bottled up into this post I am so tired of being alone I cannot bare it anymore. My depression and anxiety is slowly killing me. I am a 23 year old male, trying to restart my adult life in college after many failed attempts at succeeding anywhere else. I work and I go to school, I see hundreds of smiling and happy faces, and I feel like I am not even really there with them. Like a one way mirror where I see them but I am never seen. I have no friends. I used to be a part of rather large group of friends, but as of now I could not tell you the last time I talked to any of those people. They have either moved on and some of them are no longer on this earth. I have acquaintances with people at work, but they have their own life to live and when it is time to clock out, again I am left to go home alone and broken. The only person I ""have"" is my mother, and she tends to make matters worse when I try to open. I am also desperately single. I have not been in a relationship, let alone just dated someone, in years. And it is soul crushing. I see all these happy couples around campus, beautiful men and women, having the time of their lives with each other. And I am so fucking jealous man. I want that happiness so desperately bad. I want to love someone, I want to FEEL loved! I want someone to help me through days like today, and to be there for them when they have those days. I want the cheesy shit like cuddling and laughing over stupid stuff. I want the inevitable times where we are pissed at each other about something, but we work through it and end up going crawling up next to each other in bed at the end of the night, and wake up to see each other to start the day. I am tired of waking up to this massive empty bed, cold and alone. But most of all, I am tired of pretending. Of having to pretend. To wear this mask every single fucking day of my life just to pretend to be normal. Just so my coworkers will not think I am weird. Just so my mom will not go off about how I just need to get my shit together. Just so I can hold up the chance that one day I will be able to overcome my massive wall of social anxiety and try to talk to someone, make a friend, maybe meet a girl. All in all I am tired of pretending I am happy, that I am fine. BECAUSE IM NOT FUCKING FINE! I am not happy, I am slowly dying over here and I cannot take this shit anymore. I desperately want to change. I desperately want to live a ""normal"" life, and I just keep sinking further and further down while everyone else passes me by. I guess my rant is over. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.","I want that happiness so desperately bad.

"Long Winded Post From a Failed 30 Year Old I do not even necessarily want to write this but I need to clear my head. I have been a depressed pissant for as long as I could remember. Some of my youngest memories are melancholic and sickly devoid of confidence or even reason. I grew up dirt poor. I remember spending a night pushing a needle through the rubber of my shoes to get the sole back on. My mom had a stroke and an aneurysm but survived. Sort of. She became a wicked, wicked creature who loved pitting me against my sibling and I never came out on top. My entire life has been from the cowering creature perspective. Life is not experienced but something that happens to me. I joined the Army at 18. I had gotten recklessly married a month prior to shipping to basic. I ended up fucking up and missing a bus which led to a Lemony Snicket series of Unfortunate Events type shit. I went through partial infantry brainwashing but never made it past the build-up. So I ended my career, the only thing I have wanted to do, before it even took off. Luckily, it was more of a ""this is not working so we will forget it happened"" type deal and my enlistment ended without anything terrible. But I never recovered. At least back then I had some sort of tenacity. Now? I am a fucking shell, mate, of what I was. A completely hollow individual. I am 30 years old. I have no education. I have no passions. I used to enjoy writing but I cannot bring myself to write anymore. The moment I try I go back into wounded animal mode. No, this is not good enough. Nope, neither is this. Why bother? Why try? I cannot help but think these things. I am still married and that is the only reason I have not killed myself. I did try early on because of relentless hounding from my father in law. It is obvious I am not what he wanted for his daughter. I cannot figure out why I am alive at all. I can barely live my life. I am depressed constantly. No matter how happy I know I should be or how wide I smile I am in the grey of storm clouds that seemed, at least until this subreddit, to be only over my head. I have had so many jobs that I just explosively quit. I have got Intermittent Explosive Disorder as well as depression and anxiety. So I coil up and wind tightly before my brain dumps chemicals that make me explode with no regard for the damage done. I am currently unemployed. I left my last job like that. I loved my job. I loved the guy I worked for. I earned several raises within a few months and was promoted quickly because I threw my back into that work. It has been too long though. I cannot seem to find another job. I cannot even bring myself to apply anymore. I do not have a car. I ""rent"" a couple rooms off the main house of my inlaws. I failed so hard in giving my wife a life worth living. She spends her time working and though understands and does not mind my unemployment it is killing me. On Dec.12th I lost all interest in anything. I used to escape in video games but now I cannot. I load up Ark and just stare. I have anxiety about everything. Recently installed Heroes of the Storm and I played a mean Lili and Abathaur but now I have got butterflies even playing against bots. The smallest, most simple of tasks seems beyond me. I am stupider than I used to be. How I interpret the simplest of sentences or instruction is out of whack. I have trouble reading though I have got tons of read Omnibuses from Warhammer 40k on my bookshelf. I have trouble speaking. I talk slowly and can barely push out the words off my tongue. I am only recently able to make phonecalls without losing my mind anxiety wise. I am so full of regret. I hate what I became. I hate that I married someone and am dragging them through the mud. To never have a real apartment or car. I cannot hold a job. I barely take care of the house. I do dishes now but it is a real struggle. I have been thinking a lot more about suicide and I am already sure I am too cowardly to really do it but I think about it a lot. How it would hurt my wife but I think it would be good for her to find someone else. I just do not see the point in continuing. I am an adult now but I never learned how to properly be an adult. I do not know what to do. There is a burning hole in my chest and I feel guilty that I am the way that I am. Even on the subreddit. I know people feel that people who have a significant other cannot be as depressed but I am swimming at the bottom of the barrel. I want this all to end. I do not know how to survive. I do not know how people manage it. I do not have that self-preservation sense that keeps people going despite it all. I am weak. I am weak in ways that I can barely accept. I struggle a lot with the fact 22 veterans a day kill themselves but I am still around. I carry endless guilt that better people die and I am still alive. Goddamn it. People are dying from diseases and cancers while I exist. While I cannot so much as go outside without feeling like all eyes are boring holes into my psyche. I hate that all I do is sit here and lay in bed. I hate myself. I feel if I do not get this out, even if it is never seen by anyone, I will implode. I am on medication and it helped my depression but then the reality of my life struck me and I think I am worse off than I was. At least then I was able to lose myself in video games. Now I am here with the stark reality. I am not meant for this world. I am too sensitive, too weak, too weak-willed, and too much of a bitch to handle life. I will go back to lurking now.

The thing that sucks is that i have no one left to talk to No one is willing to talk to me and listen to my bullshit. And everyone that I have told ends up leaving me or call the cops or some shit. No friends either. Just keeping the suicidal and depressing thoughts to myself waiting for me to blow and kill myself one day. Maybe I look forward to that day,Just keeping the suicidal and depressing thoughts to myself waiting for me to blow and kill myself one day.
"I need to get my life on track Im 23 year old black man who just graduated from one of the best universities in the US. I have been depressed as fuck for a large portion of the last 4-6 years. I have no money, no girlfriend(or prospects), and no social life to speak of. I had a solid social life in college but had no luck with girls. Made a lot of friends but none that I would consider great ones. I am afraid of public expression, if I come out of this shell I will just be that little underdeveloped, short loser who thinks he is the shit when he is accomplished nothing in life. I am afraid of what other people think of me, do they think I am smart? Do they think I am nerdy? Do they think I cannot dance? Do they think I am too short? Do they think I am attractive? Do they think I am gay? Do they think my voice is deep enough? Do they think I am laid back? Do they think I am fake? Do they think I am a pussy? Do they think I get girls? Do they think my dick is small? Do they think I am dressed well? Do they think I am shy? Do they think I am lame for a black guy? Do they think I act too white? Do they notice the awkwardness when I talk? Do they think I speak well? Do they think I ask too many questions? This causes me to lie to the people around me, including my family about little things that it is unnecessary to lie about. To put on this front of fake confidence when inside I feel like I am not worth shit. I blow off my friends and then justify it to myself that I am somehow too good for them. I do not pick up phone calls from family members and try to keep to myself. I just do nothing all day and wait for shit to come to me. I am not the guy that gets girls, when it comes to trying to actually start a relationship with a girl my awkwardness and lameness just begins to show itself and she immediately senses it and can tell I am not shit. I have had sex with 2 girls in my life and could not actually bust a nut for whatever reason. I am an asshole to the people around me that do really nice things for me but somehow my brain keeps justifying my behavior and I keep doing it. I cannot bring myself to do anything that is remotely productive or will help me better my life. I am self aware to the point where I know I am being a complete piece of shit but I cannot find the motivation to turn it around. It is like my brain telling me I will be content just living in my parents house until I am fucking 60 years old. Somehow when I look in the mirror I see myself as an attractive man, I just look super young for 23, people say I look as young as 16 so I am also self conscious about that which also makes me put on this facade when I am around people. Recently for long stretches of months I just go completely ghost and do not leave the house or do anything of use. On the bright side I have had many positive experiences in life where I have felt my potential as a person start to become realized. I have a degree in communication studies from a top 15 university in the US. I have a family that loves and supports me (but probably wants me to move out just as much as I want to move out). This is all pretty incoherent and stream of consciousness but my brain is just really jumbled right now and I had to vent. I need to turn my fuckin life around.","I am afraid of public expression, if I come out of this shell I will just be that little underdeveloped, short loser who thinks he is the shit when he is accomplished nothing in life.

"Hi everyone. I am here because I am very depressed due to uncontrollable situations of extreme stress this year and a lifetime of stupid choices that have led me to where I am today: lonely and sad. I talked to my primary dr. and now have been taking Zoloft for almost 2 months. It seems to help some, I do not feel like I will panic to the point of losing control completely. And I am seeking help, I do not have a therapist yet, but I checked with my insurance and wrote some names down, now I have to pick up the phone and speak into the receiver and set an appointment. My plan is to do this on Monday. I like to be supportive of others, so although I do sound gloomy, I hope to meet others who are making progress and maybe be of help to you, too. I will post more later I feel the need to sleep. I have trouble with sleep and nightmares and eating, lately I have to force myself to eat, I have a weird aversion to food, I start to feel sick & queasy when I try to eat. But life in general makes me sick and queasy. I am alone for the Holidays which suits me just fine. I wish I could go to the ""Island of misfit people"" and stay there and never leave. For now that is the comfort and safety of my home, unless I go to work or need groceries. Later..","It seems to help some, I do not feel like I will panic to the point of losing control completely.

"Long text, I just want an audience. Why have not I killed myself yet? It is not the title, but a question that lingers on the back of my head every second. It is a common trend that people live for other people but what do you do when you have no one to live for? I never had anyone to live for. It is not a huge problem really, its another lingering question or jealousy I have whenever I meet a person. Every single one of them have someone who cares for them, even a stranger would care for them. It makes me feel jealous that no one would care for me or even bother to be nice to me unless I open my mouth and say I have cancer or they knew about any of my situation. People do not care, they pity me. They realize, then, that I am a hopeless situation and they cannot help me at all because they really cannot. No one can. Therapies do not help. My therapist knows all of my situations are out of my control and he wants me to move forward with my life. It is not really a bad idea, it is the smart thing to do especially being someone in my situation. I just do not know why I cannot. Every single being on the planet wants me to graduate already but my body does not agree with me. It is always either I am too sad/ stressed/ depressed/ ashamed/ anxious/ lazy to go to school. Nothing helps. Not even the 30mg of Lexapro helps. My school counsellor is doing the nice I get it, I understand approach with me and it makes me feel better but it really does make me feel guilty. I just do not understand why are people act so shitty with me? Is it my face? Is it because no one cares and all I have is literally myself? Is it because I am dying soon? What is it really? I just want to fucking die but I cant just let myself slash my throat or swallow a lot of pills because I am a coward. I want the easy way out. Why is not cancer an instant death? Why are not suicide booths similar to futurama a thing? I give up. I just want to die. P.S. Fuck people who say they are afraid of rejection because hunty what world do u fucking live in that not one single person has said no to you? P.P.S. Fuck you E, I am sorry I disappointed you that I did not die yet even my diagnosis' average life span is 6 months. Do not worry, it is coming. And I surely fucking hope karma is real. It is fucking people like you who deserve such things and what do you fucking get? A nice family, a handsome face, people who likes to be around you. You are one of the people who deserve my revenge and yet I am being like a pussy who is letting a fake thing called karma take care of everything. In this fucking lifetime, not a single one got any karma. (or maybe my parents did by god giving me cancer but idk they just labelled me as a liability and now has dropped me like a hot potato so that is really more on me than on them) PLEAASE I just want to die. Please just kill me.","It makes me feel jealous that no one would care for me or even bother to be nice to me unless I open my mouth and say I have cancer or they knew about any of my situation.

"Hello everyone. My name is Amy. I discovered this page just by searching on the internet for depression forums. One good thing about me, I believe, is that I am very mature for my age. I am seventeen, and really hope everyone here is open-minded to age being just a number. So please, do not reply telling me I will have it better later on, or my problems are because of my age. I know there is a possibility that things will get better, and believe me, I really do not think this has to do with teenage hormones. I have read about many middle aged women and men with the same problems. I understand that I am a very negative person, most likely due to depression. I am very irritable, only maybe once a week I am happy for most of the day. I also know that I have never really been happy. I have never been optimistic, and have always been sensitive, emotional, and not very confident. At the moment I do not have any friends. I have not really had any friends for a few years now. Once every few months or so I will go out, and then just want to leave within a couple of hours. It is very stressful to me. And when I do want to leave, I just tell myself I have a problem, because everyone else I know seems to get along with people just fine. I am also like this with jobs. I go in and out of jobs. One time I even faked a family emergency just to leave work..and I was crying about it. If one thing goes wrong for me, if I smile at someone and they do not smile back, if I feel insecure in any way, my first reaction is to flee. I also, for the most part of my life have always been in a relationship. My boyfriend as of right now and I have been together for over a year. Both of us cheated on each other in the beginning of our relationship, which might be the cause of our jealousy problems now(mostly mine). But, before this relationship, I also had the same problem. I never felt good enough, I believe I will never feel pretty enough. I have big issues with porn, and basically every little thing you can think of. Recently I have been reading about depression and anxiety. I feel the more I understand how and that it is a part of me, the worse I feel about myself. And the more insecure I feel. I feel like I am not fun to be around since I am irritable and sad most of the time. I feel like my boyfriend will find someone who has more of the good qualities. I feel that I will never satisfy or make my parents proud, since I keep leaving jobs. They tell me I am just lazy. I have quit every single thing in my life that I have tried since I was young. But I really think it is because of my mental state. Going out in public is terrifying, because I do not want to feel bad, ugly, unfun, or not funny. I fear social situations, because I am horrible at making conversation. I have been considering therapy and depression/anxiety pills, but my mom tells me people who take them basically just do not feel anything at all. And I am also afraid to see a doctor and share my feelings. I feel like I have no one to talk to. My dad and I have never had a good relationship, we maybe say two words to each other a day. We have had kind of a bad past, and maybe that is the reason for our lack of communication. My boyfriend does not really know how to talk about important or emotional things, unless they have to do with him. I feel like every time I cry I push him farther away from me, and feel I have to hide everything because me being depressed is a turn off to him. I do not know. I guess we all have to vent somewhere, and to know that there is a place where people feel the same is a great thing to me. I wish there was an easy way to feel good about myself, and just be happy for once. But I suppose these things take time and a lot of effort. I am sure I left some things out, but this is all I want to throw at you all for now. Thank you for listening.","And when I do want to leave, I just tell myself I have a problem, because everyone else I know seems to get along with people just fine.

"Does anybody feel like their life is meaningless if they do not have a relationship or crush In my opinion it feels like love is the only medicine strong enough to cure my depression. Whenever I am in love or lust I am on top of the world I feel so good everything feels great, but once something happens to it I fall down this hole and my depression comes back even stronger. I need to learn to be their for me to grow love for myself. That almost seems impossible but I will not give up and I am going to work on becoming a better me.

"Why I always let myself fooled.. Why I always think there is something more than there really is.. I always think I am good friends with someone and I act accordingly. I try to be that good friend. Then at some point I always realize that it is not a real friendship. The other one did not think it that seriously. The other one just talked with me because at that time it was fun. It feels crushing. Realizing every single time that the person you took as a good friend, or even possible friend is not really thinking same about you.

help..? Has anyone reached a point in their life where they knew they needed help but wasnt quite sure how to ask for it or even know what it is they needed help with and who they would need to ask in order to figure out what they needed help? not really a depressive question but more of a question i felt might be better in the depression tread,-
"I lost my father recently, and now I have less suicidal thoughts This is not gonna be what you think it is gonna be. If you read the title you are probably thinking my father was the reason of my issues. He was not, I loved him very dearly. I am extremely sad he passed away while I am in such a young age (I am 21) but c'est la vie I guess.. The reason I am now less likely to commit suicide is actually I will not / cannot do this to my mother. We had to plan and pay for the funereal and oh my days it is expensive. Already we were on the line of poverty, and this did not quite help. I just cannot do it to my mother to spend even more money that she does not really have. So now the feeling of guilt 'if' I were to do it is bigger than my misery. Now I just slate the days away, it is hard, but there is no other option for me right now..","The reason I am now less likely to commit suicide is actually I will not / cannot do this to my mother.

"extreme sadness whenever seeing anything happy Hello, this has been bothering me for a while and i have no idea what is this but when i ever i read or see anything happy like a happy scene or a happy story from some random comment i feel a huge wave of sadness wash over me and i feel like crying, why? what is going on? (i am not sure if this belongs to here but if not i do not mind it being deleted and sorry for breaking rules.)",-
"Why is life horrible to me and only me It just seems like one bad thing after another. Every time I try to reach out and open up to people it just goes down in flames.

"It is not some fucking sadness anymore. This is madness. I remember when I just had a few days when I felt sad and out of it. And I would worry but then everything became better a few days later. Still, I went to a psychologist, because my downs were too consistent to be considered normal. It all went downhill from there. I feel like I have lost a part of myself. My personality, my identity, whatever. I feel like when I talk to others I am not there, like I have lost control of what I say and think. Like I have lost my mind. Like others are normal and I am in my own world, going through life on automatic mode, not knowing what I should think, say, or do. Even though from outside people might say I am completely normal, even sometimes better than before, I feel like mentally, inside, the world is going down. My life is crumbling. Like piece by piece I get further away from a solution. Things that seem to work for others do not work for me. I hate it. It is not just a bad mood anymore. It is feeling like I have lost my way, and there is no signs to get back. Like a loop I cannot get out of. That is why suicide comes up as an option. When you are stuck in a loop, the only solution is to shut off. If sleeping is the only thing I enjoy, then why will not I sleep forever? Fuck that shit","It is not some fucking sadness anymore.

"Here is a new update for interested readers. Bad news first: I got a voicemail last week, it said my mother was in the hospital. It took me awhile to get more info, I called and left a message where she lived because it was too late to get anyone on the phone there. I finally found out where she was and called the hospital. They said she was having problems walking, that maybe she hurt her back. That she was getting breathing treatments because she had trouble breathing. Part of it was she could not smoke, part of it was probably because she does smoke. They did not seem to find out what caused the problem with her legs. Then she had some other stuff wrong. Part of the good news was one thing they thought was wrong was caused by a shot they gave her, and it was solved the next day. Now, I called her Friday and she said her heart test showed a tear in a valve. She is getting a more detailed test next week, the doctor said it is too early to tell how serious it is or if it needs anything done to it. He told her, it could be just something minor that needs to be monitored and could cause no problems at all or it could require heart surgery. So I was very worried about that. My first thought when I heard she was in the hospital was that she would end up having cancer from smoking, or liver disease from drinking. But I did not think of any heart problems. I am hoping that it will not be anything serious, or that if she needs surgery that it will be successful and she will recover without any complications. I do not know much about heart surgery, I know I have heart that many bypass patients have good surgery but get sick and die from complications after the surgery. I hope and pray that she will be ok, I live far from her and cannot do anything but call her and pray. Now some good news, my new job is going to switch me to fulltime hours next week. I still have to find out if it will be temporary or long-term, but I am happy either way. I went from poor and going to be homeless, to having a place to live and a low-stress job in a short time. Each day I wake up and am alive and have a place to live means a lot to me now. It kind of gives me a better perspective on life in a way. I know so many people have it worse, so much suffering in the world and I am lucky. I have to get some new clothes because changing to fulltime I have to go by a different dress code, so I will be looking for cheap nice clothes tomorrow. I am thankful I have some money to look for clothes. I am still adjusting to things, sometimes I feel like ""where am I, what is going on?"" but it is better than before when I was at my apartment thinking ""when will I get kicked out, where will I live?"" I am trying to take it one step at a time, not worry about where I am supposed to be going in life. I am thinking, what do I need, get things stable, be able to support yourself, get a phone, get car insurance, get more hours at work etc.. I try to stay positive and be grateful, but still I am a little lost. If anyone wants more details about things, or advice on how I have coped with anything just leave a reply and I will answer you. I have a lot of things I have learned and advice, but I do not go around telling people what to do or pushing my point of view. I try to just express myself without pushing.","Part of the good news was one thing they thought was wrong was caused by a shot they gave her, and it was solved the next day.

"I have been having suicidal thoughts more than ever.. I feel like I fail at everything, I do not have any motivation to clean or really do anything. I feel like I am no good at anything and have gotten really lazy. I am not the best wife and I have made many mistakes. If i asked my husband to do something and he did not I would complain to try and get help. If he is not doing anything I would not either. Now that he is moved out I feel like I do not really have any reason to live. I used to smoke weed but had to stop a little under a month ago cause I got arrested (on my anniversary) and am facing felony charges on something that is legal. I have had to hire a lawyer and everything to try to keep my record clean. I have had suicidal thoughts since I was in high school and kind of turned smoking a bowl into my medicine so I would always refuse depression meds. I have heard mixed things about them, and I am scared on how they would take effect on me. But since the arrest I have been getting progressively worse and worse. My husband was the one who initially got me to quit hurting myself and the thoughts keep haunting me more than ever. One of the biggest reasons I have not been able to bring myself to doing it again is I care for others more than myself.

"To start off I have had depression quite consistently since I have started college at 18. I am now 22 and my depression was getting pretty bad again, then I met this girl about 4 months ago. We started dating and it turned out we and tons of similar interests and very similar morals. A few days after we started dating she told me that she was going to australia to study abroad for 10 months, weeks later she told me she was afraid to lose me I told her we would worry about it when the time comes. Since then we have had some really great times doing things we both love together. Yesterday we finally had the discussion of what was going to happen when she left. In my mind I was hopeful that we could maintain this relationship despite the obvious obstacles. I told her I cared about her more than anyone I have ever dated and said that I wish we had a chance together. She told me she does not believe in long distance relationships, this kind of broke my heart but at the same time I knew it was the logical choice in this situation. She told me that she did not want to cut me out of her life and that she wanted to stay in contact with me. She also said that if it was meant to be that it will happen for us. My family has been very hesitant about our relationship because they worry about me spiraling downward when she leaves. I am a little worried about myself as well, today I cried on the way to school and during my break between classes. She leaves in 6 days and she still wants to see me as much as possible before she leaves. I am so afraid to lose her and scared of how I will feel when she is gone. Please help.","A few days after we started dating she told me that she was going to australia to study abroad for 10 months, weeks later she told me she was afraid to lose me I told her we would worry about it when the time comes.

"I am 34 year old single mother in a weird relationship and living in a place I cannot seem to adjust to and is very far from my home and my family. I am broke, have hardly any job prospects, and do not own a car. I do not get along with the father of my daughter and just got swindled by his lawyer so he does not ever have to pay child support (long story). He is an ass! I have had 2 abortions and 1 miscarriage in the last three years and am very regretful for them and cannot seem to forgive myself. My parents and I are not speaking due to my mother is alcoholism and my choice to move so far away. My partner has recently decided he does not want to have any children, which was the straw on the camels back, and on my birthday I had a complete breakdown. I have had depression for as long as I can remember, along with anxiety. Due to these events the last four years, I have just recently dived into the world of antidepressants. I took Wellbutrin SR 300 mg for about 1 month and it does not seem to do much. My doctor gave me Cymbalta 30 mg, and it also seems not to do too much. Not sure if I can combine the two or not. Does anyone know if you can? They both decreased my appetite noticeably, but my energy level is still low and and I still feel a little anxious and depressed.

Did your mental health get worse post secondary? So I am in grade 12 right now and I will probably be moving out and onto a uni campus (if they accept me hopefully) and I am honestly pretty nervous. I have been clean for a little over a year now and I am terrified I will relapse and without my parents and dog with me it will be even tougher.

"I wish I could have done things differently I graduated high school in June of 2015. Currently I am attending community college and have been doing fairly well so far although I do not know how long I can keep it up. Back in high school I did not try as hard as I could have resulting in lower grades thus barring my chances of getting into a four year university. Freshmen year of high school I saw my lowest gpa ever I had gotten a 1.8 gpa in the 2nd semester of that year. Hell I was dumb enough in my freshman year to think that I could get away with cheating in my ceramics class but I ended up getting caught. If the university applications saw that I got a D in an art class they would have thought I was a full on retard for trying to apply to a university. It was because of my second semester of freshmen year that I thought my chances of a four year were impossible. I also never bothered to do the ACT/SAT because I thought that with my low gpa it would not have mattered anyway. The following years in hs I have managed to improve a bit but not all that much. After high school ended I spent a year and a half not really knowing what I was doing taking a class at my community college here and there but not really committing, while also changing my major at least twice. If I play my cards right I will be able to graduate by he end of May in 2019 and hopefully transfer to a university. But recently I cannot help but think of how my life would have been if I had just went straight to a university after high school. I do not have any friends right now and I feel that if I had gone to university out of high school I would have had friends at this point. Right after high school I did not really have any second thoughts and what I was doing. I was fine with going to community college and transferring later on but right now I cannot help but feel that I have made a huge mistake. If only I had done better in freshmen year I probably would have gotten accepted into university and had a completely different life. I am only 21 and I already feel like a huge goddamn retard for how I acted in my high school life. If i had taken things more seriously my life right now would have been a lot better. I feel like I have massively screwed myself. Most of the time now I think about what I could have done differently in high school and what my life would be like now. I honestly hate everything about myself and wish that I could just go back and make things right in high school.","After high school ended I spent a year and a half not really knowing what I was doing taking a class at my community college here and there but not really committing, while also changing my major at least twice.

I dont have anything to live for anymore. I dont have any idea what to do with my life. I dont have any special talent or skills. The only hobby I really have is video games, but Im horrible at those. I have raged so hard at Battlefield that I broke down in tears and drooled everywhere, and anytime I play an RPG I restart so many times that it makes me not want to play anymore.

And to be honest, Im scared of becoming an adult. Managing a budget, doing taxes, paying bills, and shit like that. Im not fucking prepared for it. If I cant deal with the stress of a fucking video game, then I sure as hell cant deal with a job. My parents are also hounding me to get a girlfriend. I dont even have a friend who is a girl.

"exhausted this is my first time posting on this subreddit but I need something to regurgitate everything that I am feeling as it may be the only thing that stops me from trying to hurt myself. I have only slept for about 2 hours and I have to be up for work in 30 minutes which is making me feel worse. As my depression has gotten worse, I find myself sinking further into a place where I have no desire to help or look after myself. I still live at home with my parents and since my mom is aware of my attempts to hurt myself, she has taken on a lot of the responsibilities that I once had for myself. Like cooking for me, cleaning for me, taking me to work sometimes, sleeping in my bed with me. I feel so fucking bad about that, I feel bad for her and I feel bad that she is really the only person. I have my boyfriend who has been as supportive as he can be, especially because he is dealing with his own obstacles and I feel like I am incapable of being there for him. I keep having thoughts of breaking up with him and becoming so sensitive towards everything he says and it makes me beyond words angry at myself that I have failed him and our relationship. I cannot make me happy, I cannot make him happy and I will not make anyone happy ever. I am attention and reassurance seeking, I get so angry at the successes of others because I am not good enough. My identity is shattered and especially because now all I can think about is how sad I am. If I am on this downward spiral now, will I ever get out of it?? If I have to live with this any longer, I really do not want to live anymore.

I attempted to overdose recently and all I thought about was someone finding me dead on the floor and hoping they would feel bad. I could not even think of how this would affect my poor mother who has been through so much with my ungrateful attenuation seeking ass. Im so grossed out with myself. I am eating at myself and letting myself go, I keep picking and scratching and slapping myself because I do not think I deserve to get better. I deserve to hurt because I am a sad sack of shit who has NOTHING to be sad about. I have everything I could ever need in life and I am still complaining like an ingrate. I fucking hate myself so much, there is someone out there who deserves my own life more than I do. I am going to start antidepressants I was prescribed re cently and am in therapy (I do not go as often as I probably should) and while that is good, I am almost scared of getting better just to get worse again.

You could walk or ride your bike to anywhere - down to the lake, out on country roads, wherever. My father was a Lutheran school teacher, principal and church organist. From time to time, he would take a ""call"" to serve in another Lutheran school in a different town. In the summer of 1968, right after my junior year in high school, he decided to take a call to a school in the north side of the city of St. Louis. It was quite a culture shock for a sheltered young woman who had only lived in small, insular towns all her life, to move to a city the size of St. Louis. Quite honestly, when we arrived here I absolutely hated it. I felt as if I would been thrown to the dark side of the moon. I had to start my senior year in a new high school in a completely foreign environment. Everyone else already had their group or circle of friends going back at least three years. Now you had to have a lot more guts and fortitude and self-esteem than I had at the time to break into already established groups and make new friends. This was the year that would set the stage for the first major depressive episode in my life. This was the year of my first therapist, the first of many to come. The start of a lifetime of self-discovery.","From the third grade through my junior year in high school, I lived in a small lakeside community in southwestern Michigan.

I put a loaded rifle in my mouth So about a month ago I got really drunk and kind of lost my shit I usually just suck it the fuck up but I do not know if it was the alcohol or if I was just fucking done with it but I came into my bedroom and put a loaded rifle in my mouth and was going to pull the trigger but my sister walked in and grabbed the gun away from me she told the rest of the family and they to me to the ER and then put me in the nut House for a few days they let me out after I said I was fine and do not know what happened I lied and told them I blacked out and do not remember anything about that night but I do so they let me out but I am still fucked up and now I find myself sitting there alone with my pistol on my lap just thinking and I do not really feel nervous about it anymore I just feel like it may be the way to go just get in my truck and drive off somewhere where no one will find me and do it,-
"I hate it when bad people get rewarded One of the facts that depresses me most about life is when bad people get rewarded and live comfortably, and loved by all. It is hard for me to stomach. For example, I saw one of my former bullies enter the store I work at. She was absolutely terrible toward me when we were in high school, such as defacing my sketchbook, purposefully kicking my food away, sending me fake ""love letters"", and more. Anyway, the bully now had two children (I am having trouble conceiving so that stings), and I think the bully could smell my fear because she headed right to my counter, and began to make a show of how expensive everything was in our store while also ""catching up"" by telling me about how successful she is with her self made interior design business. When I got home that night, I looked her up on Facebook, and..she does have a much better life than mine. In every way. I feel angry that she seemed to have a great one while I have..struggled.","I hate it when bad people get rewarded One of the facts that depresses me most about life is when bad people get rewarded and live comfortably, and loved by all."
"Hi I am Ricky, I am 17 years old and I think I have been living with depression for the past 2 years. I have been through a lot of issues in my life that makes my life feel so unbearable and lonely. I have not been through any therapy so I have not been diagnosed with depression but I obviously have not been feeling happy. I am a senior in high school and I hate going to school every morning, I do not feel like I fit in really. Reasons are because I am a social outcast and I do not really like being around other people because I may seem to be off tangent. People seem to judge me too quickly and this really pisses me off, or is it that I am way too paranoid. I zone out a lot and just stare at people without even saying a word to any of them. Like I am really anxious around them and I feel completely uncomfortable. I started smoking weed when I was a sophomore and ever since then people such as my friends seem to drift away but it did not really bother me till now. I do not really have that many close friends other than just friends that I smoke with. My parents say I should avoid those friends just so I can get a better perspective in my life but then I do not know how to make new ones. I really want to make new ones because I want to have a better social life but I do not know how to get myself motivated. I want someone to care for like a girl friend, just so that I do not feel so lonely, but then again I do not think I can have a healthy relationship. My parents also say that I should be more open with God but I do not have any faith (if I do not even have any faith in myself, how could I have any with God). I just turn away and just hide and just think that it will all be different the next day but never is. Please I need some help because I do not want to feel even more depressed.

"The pharmacist always starts treating me like I am fragile and could crack any minute as soon as she sees my prescription is for bupropion. I am fragile of course, but it kills me to see that visible switch from general customer service friendly to you poor thing, let me treat you like the sad and fragile creature you are. They all mean well, and it is nice to see that they take it seriously, but I just want to be treated like I am more than my depression. I will not hurt myself because you did not call me a sweet name like honey and change the tone of your voice to one you would use worth a small child who is upset. I know you see the dead look in my eyes and wonder if my meds are not strong enough or if you need to remind me yet again that I need to watch for increased thoughts of suicide. I feel better than I have in a long time, but I am not there yet and I am still struggling to address the root of my depression, so yeah I still look awful.","They all mean well, and it is nice to see that they take it seriously, but I just want to be treated like I am more than my depression."
"According to the mental health nurse i am not depressed So since october 2016 i have been (or at least thought I had) been depressed. I dropped out of school, started self harming and was put in hospital twice among other things. I spent nearly the whole of 2017 at home doing nothing because I simply could not. I got a full time job in september but I hated it and it made me worse and I had to quit after I started self harming again and have been cutting up until now (i am 18 by the way if that is important). Things have been getting worse again recently. I am cutting almost every night and feel down and just cant do anything. I do not even have the energy to shower most days and just stay in bed until the late afternoon. However I was hopeful for today as I was going to see a new nurse who I was hoping would be able to set up a plan to help me. I was with the child services before and had an amazing nurse who helped me greatly but as i am 18 i am classed as an adult so have to go to the adult services. So as soon as I met the new nurse and we went into the room to talk she told me she knows almost nothing about me despite there being many notes from the past year. I told her about leaving my job and feeling low and the self harm and everything and what she basically told me is ''you are not depressed''. She said that my self harm was normal as it was just scratches and I was not cutting deep enough to leave any scars which just completely confused me considered i would been put in hospital partly for doing the same thing before. I have also suffered with terrible social anxiety all my life and find it very hard to communicate with others. I told her the only friends i have ever had was the friends I have made years ago when I first started going to school and what she said was it sounds like I have great social skills as i have been able to make friends. It honestly felt like she was not listening to a single word I was saying. As I said she had no notes from before and was basically just assuming what was wrong with me and that was it. Also I should add i am in the UK so this is with the NHS so i am not paying for this however my parents have said they would be willing to pay for some sessions with a therapist if that is was I need. I am sorry if this is long or it just sounds like i am complaining. I just wanted other peoples opinions on this as I just do not know what to think.","I told her about leaving my job and feeling low and the self harm and everything and what she basically told me is ''you are not depressed''.

"42 year old male newbie, just discovering that I suffer from depression. While there has been evidence all throughout my life, and while I have family members that have suffered from depression (grandmother committed suicide), I for some reason am just figuring out now that I suffer from the disease. My questions for those much more experienced and knowledgeable on the forum. 1. How would you go about your initial steps of diagnosis and treatment? I currently do not have med insurance, so cost is certainly an issue (we should have medical insurance in place in about a month, as part of my wife is new employer package). 2. I take a healthy dose of vitamins daily, including proteins such as L-Tyrosine, which helps me feel really good when I am not under the effects of depression. Does anyone on the forum have experience with L-Tyrosine and its impact on their feelings of depression? I understand that the amino acids help with the production of dopamine and helps with brain function. Any comments? A little background: I am just coming off a very successful 4 year period where I started a complicated new business and got married again. However, during these last few months I have been unable to work at my previous pace, putting my business in real jeopardy. In fact, there are only a couple of days per week where I seem to be able to work, and typically only a few hours at a time during those days. When I do work I get exhausted quickly. Today, I had a major conference call that required some preparation. I was very up during the call, but then collapsed afterward in complete exhaustion. Seems to be the story for me recently, I can psych myself up for short bursts of performance, then I quickly decline again in an inability to concentrate on anything other than light web surfing. I continue to get up early and exercise daily. I live a healthy lifestyle, eat well, and walk 5+ miles every morning. I sleep regular hours, however, will sleep a few hours during the day during my wouldown' days. Looking back at my past, I am now clearly seeing times in my life where my performance level went down drastically, or where I had problems with relationships. At the time, I did not realize anything was going on, or I simply did not understand it. I can now go recall having real problems with my grades during my freshman year of high school. At the time, I recall saying to myself that I could not understand why I was performing so badly. It was as it something was holding me back and I could not overcome it. At the time, I just kept studying and working harder, but I was unsuccessful. Eventually, I got through it and my grades went back to normal. But all of these years I never really understood what happened in that freshman year, until now. In summary, there have been many other times in my life where things have fallen apart and I have not understood why. My past is littered by successful businesses that I have created and then have eventually failed, usually by my inability to maintain my performance level. There has obviously been a pattern that I do not yet understand, but at least now I am beginning to see why there was a downturn. Thankfully, I have now met the women of every man is dreams. While she knows I am depressed I have not yet let her know the depths of my despair or of my recent understanding of my past behavior. The good news here is that I have great family support, but I am wrestling with how much to tell my wife about what is going on inside my head. She gets stressed easily and will worry deeply about me. I am not sure I want to lay that all out on her. Anyone else find themselves in this dilemma? Well, thank you for giving me the opportunity to share and to join this forum.","2.

"We have been playing Quake 4 almost every night for a little while. We play online against other players using Xbox Live and it is very cool. Most people are friendly. We have made some 'friends' and we find them and play with them. One time I found some person talking too much trash and you can go in a mute them or set a preference to never see them again. Well, last night I encountered a group who had a feud going. One kid was talking too much trash and people on the other side were just going with it. I figured one game was a not a big deal. But sometimes you end up finding them again and again in the same night. I have this guy some slack and did not say anything but then later I got to play as part of the same team with him. What a jerk. He kept asking me to give him the flag so he score it and get the points instead of me. Forget about the team winning, this guy wanted all the points for himself and did not care about the team. I had to set him straight, and after the game I had to report him as being a trash player and set in my preferences to never see him again. After that I saw the other players and they were all nice. It only takes one guy to ruin a great experience. Overall, playing online with all these people and talking with them is great, you just have to know when to cut someone loose. Eventually when many people report him as being a jerk, he will be banned from the game. Oh well.","I had to set him straight, and after the game I had to report him as being a trash player and set in my preferences to never see him again.

"I can absolutely relate to what you are going through. I understand how difficult it is adjusting to so many different personalities. Ten people in one apartment is overwhelming, to say the least. I used to live with four other girls who had diverse interests, and unfortunately we all kept to ourselves because of the different personalities. It was best that way. In your case, it seems like you are making as much effort as you can to be social. There is no need to go out on a limb to prove that you are not anti-social. When I had depression I really needed my space and the last thing I wanted to do was socialize with my roommates. Luckily, I am in my own apartment and have been living alone for three years now. It has helped enormously. I wonder if you can request a transfer to a bachelor suite where you can live by yourself. I did that in my 3rd year and the apartment manager put me on a waiting list, and I was able to get my own living space by November. Even though the moving was a hassle, I never regretted it. As for finding ways to spend time away from the noise of other people, I usually take the bus to visit a bookstore that is far away from campus. I go there every weekend to relax and read. It is away from campus life and it has helped me sort out my thoughts. The suggestions made by others such as the library, and a park are wonderful too. Maybe you can purchase a bus pass? I have depression and social anxiety, so it was difficult dealing with the university atmosphere on my own. I made only a couple of friends who have since moved on or graduated. I too saw a school counselor, but it was short-lived. What helped me, other than getting away from campus, was getting some online support from forums such as this one. I also kind of clung to one friend at a time, instead of many groups of people. I would go to the movie theatre and watch something funny, or I would take long walks. You are not alone. Hang in there and keep posting if you feel really down. I think this forum is very supportive and people will try to help you the best way they can.","Luckily, I am in my own apartment and have been living alone for three years now.

"I have been on 50 mg of Zoloft for 6 months now, and I have the worst night sweats!! I have not had any other side effects from it other than the night sweats, but this side effect is enough!

"I have lost 4 Marines to depression and almsost lost a 5th. None saw combat. I need help understanding. Hi. I just had my 4th funeral in 7 years for yet another Marine. A few days ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down. These 5 Marines, as far as i can tell suffer/suffered from depression. Pretty much every one of them was intelligent (like way too smart for the Marine Corps) and each of them stood out as ""the funny one"". To say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement. The Marine Corps has done a lot to try and help suicidal Marines, but all our training videos depict some ""clearly distressed"" person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves. In reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help. What I am asking: As someone who has never suffered depression (Ive been ""depressed"" but that was from external factors like a job not working out or a girl leaving me. I consider that normal human emotion), how do I identify Marines under my care thst may be suffering and need help. They are NOT giving the outward signs in the stupid ""Lance Corporal Decker video"" we watch once a year. Thanks. Edit: been at work all day then went to visit a former Marine that dealt with some serious issues in his day but is doing well now. Mulled over a lot of this with him, then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful responses. I have read every one, some several times. I have a lot to consider and learn, but thank you for helping me find some direction. One thing i did not mention is my role in all this. Im not sone big wig commander with tools at my disposal. Im a newly promoted Sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guys under me. The one we just burried was not in my platoon, but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss. The other three were guys i was close to back in training, but i was not currently stationed with them when it happened. In fact i found out about all three of them on Facebook. This recent one, and the one that called me with suicidal thoughts, have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me. The scary thing to me is, even with hindsight, i would not have picked these five guys out of the lot as having ANY kind of issues, let alone suicidal tendencies. I have also noticed, maybe because of my nature or leadership style, that im the one people tend come to with problems. I make it known that im here for that purpose, and people take me up on it. So I guess now i want to make sure i can spot when someone needs more help than they may be openly asking for. I will be more vigilant in my assessments of the needs of those under my watch. Thank you all for the detailed and informed replies.","The Marine Corps has done a lot to try and help suicidal Marines, but all our training videos depict some ""clearly distressed"" person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves.

"My Mom shot herself. Hi forum, I am going through alot right now and have no idea what to do. I will tell you the story, its a long one.. I hope you are willing to read. I am 32 years old, I was very close to my mother.. We had a bond that was as strong as steel. My dad whom she was with since the age of 15 left her 11 years ago for another woman and found happiness. She had never been with any other man. I have an older sister that is 42 and we had different relationships. My mother was angry and could never get over my dad, year after year we would hear how much she hated him but still loved him, she would wish they could be one again. It never happened, she had been with no one and remained lonley for 11 years. Her depression became her life, it was so bad we would stop talking to her because all she would talk about is killing herself and how she hated my dad. 10 years of it, She had little money and was very sick, She went from healthy to brittle in a matter of 10 years. Back surgery is, aching bones, depression, pain pain and more pain. It became up to me and my sister to take care of her, she could not drive so we always had to drive over to take her to the dr, groceries or to get things she needed, it became stressfull and we would somtimes bicker over it..even after the divorce my dad helped when he wanted to or could. She started thinking she was a burden.. then started lashing out on us at times, I went a whole year not speaking to her until she called me to apologize for her horrible words with me. I forgave her and we began a relationship again..this time it was amazing again, we got along and finally after 10 years she accepted my partner. Long story short drama hit the fan again in early Nov this year. Things were said between her and my sister and they got me involved, I got upset with my mom and she was so hurt and thought that I thought she was a liar. My sister told me she said something about my son that she claimed she did not. I did not care after a while, I had plans with her on the day before thanksgiving to go see her.. on the 19th of NOV. She asked on the 19th if i could come hook up her VCR so she could watch A Christmas Story, I told her next weekend, then she later that night got upset again, she texted all of us the usual suicide talk. I had told her the day before that I did not want anymore drama, if i went over with my family I did not want to hear about my dad and sister. I just wanted to have a good time. She then texted me and a lot of other family that she loved me. that it was not my fault, she bought the gun.. (I took her to get that gun for protection so I always told her if she did that I would feel to blame) She would say "" SON I bought it! Dont feel to blame"" I hated that! Still I never belived she would do it.. I was so bitter about her not wanting to be possitive I hadent called her. I ignored her suicide text and just decided to let her cool off.. 20th, 21st-29th we hadnt spoken.. I had a bad feeling but didnt know why.. she hadnt called.. so i figured she was angry with me.. I get a call from my aunt on my dads side who she was very close with.. ""Is it true? The rumors about your mom?"" I was picking up my kids from school.. I said ""huh? what she say about me this time hahaha?"" ""Call your sister"" she said.. I called and she told me to go home right away.. Then she said when getting home "" Mom.. mom.. *cries*.. Moms dead.. she killed herself"" I said ""dont say that"" about 12 times breaking down more and more each time I repeated it.. I fell apart crying for who know how long.. day one was hard, day two was harder, day 3 was numb and empty and I could not cry or sleep, day 4 I then hit a new horrible moment.. I found out she had been in her apartment dead since the 20th.. the complex lied and said no one heard anything and thats another story.. they are being sued soon.. her body was in there so long that we will not have an open casket this week in her funeral.. Then i went into her apartment to start gathering her things.. i smelled the death and decay.. I have never felt so sick and horrified in my life. I will never forget it.. i went to where she did it and saw the carpet cut out and her bed gone.. her place was left just like I last saw it.. it killed me.. I am now on day 6 and her ceremony is tomorrow in her home town.. Idk what to think or feel anymore.. my wife is trying to support me cause her mom died when she was 17 but i am changing.. She can see it, I dont want to run my company, I dont sleep, I have this numb feeling.. I cry out of no where.. I can not stop picturing her lifeless body, I cant stop thinking ""was she in pain?"" picturing her bleed out her exit wound for over a week.. I cry and can not stop.. I feel like dying.. I feel so empty and full of rage.. I wounder why she left me here.. I wish I could of took it back, I feel its my fault I should have went over or called.. My phone had got disconnected on the 19th but I had a home phone, she said ""I wish you could talk to me on the phone I love you"".. I hate myself so much I hate myself!! I just can only think how I could have saved her.. I miss my mom.. I miss her so much! I dont feel I can cope.. Im sorry for your loss.. im so sorry.. welp.. shes in a better place.. STFU!!

"Zoloft made me fly off the handle I have episodes of clinical depression that last a few weeks alternating with episodes of being euphoric, having so much energy, and thinking I am the greatest person in the world and I have superpowers. It is awesome but has issues of its own because I tend to make poor choices, act conceited/rude without realizing it, and sometimes get angry. I was on Zoloft for a short time (age 11-12) and it made me a little less depressed but caused me to do horrible things impulsively, act spoiled and stuck up, and have frequent fits of rage. I attempted suicide within the first month of taking meds. I developed anorexia, made poor sexual and financial decisions, and was fired from my Saturday job as a babysitter because I was yelling at the kids, teaching them how to swear and bragging about it to other teachers, and trying to flirt with the children is fathers. At school I told everyone I had superpowers and raged at them when they said that my superpowers were not real. I had arguments with my parents and pulled out a knife to threaten them at one point. I had a boyfriend but was still flirting with other boys constantly including my teachers. I tried to rapebait by going into the house of a suspected molester/murderer/drug dealer but was stopped thankfully. After going off meds I crashed and burned HARD. I am better now however as this was 5 years ago. I cringe whenever I remember it however.","I was on Zoloft for a short time (age 11-12) and it made me a little less depressed but caused me to do horrible things impulsively, act spoiled and stuck up, and have frequent fits of rage.

"Hi, I have posted a few responses on the forum, but this will be my first thread. I guess I am wondering if I truly suffer from depression or another mental illness. I have not seen a psychologist or a therapist, but I have been reading your threads for the last few weeks. My heart goes out to you and I wish that I could lend more support than I can. I know that my situation is not nearly as dire as many of you, but I still ponder whether I have a iproblemi. For the last couple of years, I have experienced an increase in mood swings. I will be doing fine and then a ilight switchi goes off, and I get a bad case of the blues. These can last for a few of days. In my mind, I know that everything is actually okay, but I cannot shake the idowni feeling. I also have frequent bouts of being istressed-outi. By this I mean that all of the tasks that I need to get done seem to be insurmountable and that there will never be enough time to get things done. I sometimes break down in tears during my more manic attacks of frustration and worry. Life seems to have become one long list of stuff to do. Even the fun stuff has become something to get done so that I can move on to the next day. As for itriggersi, as I have been reading about in your posts, I know that I have two major issues. I do not deal well with my emotions when my husband gets angry (not abusive, just normal iguy angryi) or I feel that I have somehow iscrewed-upi and let him down by not doing something right. I turn very inward and the ilight switchi goes off. My second issues deals with embarrassment. I do not take embarrassment well. My stress/anxiety over getting the housework done stems from my concern that people may come over and I will be embarrassed by the state of the house (in fact, the house is always neat and clean, if a bit disheveled by daily life). I often worry about whether I embarrassed myself during social outings or at parties with my friends. My husband reassures me, but that does not usually ease my worry. My ObGyn gave me Sarafem (Prozac 20mg) three weeks ago, and I seem to be operating on a more even keel these days. The lows are not as low and I seem to be able to let more stuff just roll off my back. I am pleased with the results, and my husband has seen a real improvement, but I am still asking myself the basic question as to whether I am indeed ill. Please provide some feedback if you can, as this is the first time that I have tried to really tell folks about how I feel.","Even the fun stuff has become something to get done so that I can move on to the next day.

"Why does it take some 6 months to recover, some 6 years, and some never? I know it is because we all have different brains, mental illness affects us all differently. I know some illnesses have no cure. But I recently saw in a youtube comment section one person said ""I have been living with depression &amp; PTSD for 25 years, it gets easier every day blah blah blah blah.."" and someone else responded ""I recovered from depression &amp; PTSD in about 2 years.. lmao"" Do those who recover quickly look down on those who recover slowly or cannot recover at all? Also is there any more information on why we all recover at different rates other than what I mentioned above?","Why does it take some 6 months to recover, some 6 years, and some never?"
"the beautiful things in life Light streaming through the leaves of a tree. The night sky, thousands of pinpricks in black velvet. Someone so beautiful they make you catch your breath when you look at them. Those songs that make the hairs stand on your arms. The only thing that keeps me alive is the beauty in the world. It makes time slow down just for a little, and stops the incessant flow of (mostly negative) thoughts. There is so much beauty left to see. It can be as amazing as the the clear blue waters surrounding a tropical island. It could be as mundane as a flock of birds flying in harmony over your roof. Sure, there are a lot of really shitty things that we go through, but there are those breathtaking moments you have yet to experience. Those moments where you think ""damn, it really is nice to be alive.""","Someone so beautiful they make you catch your breath when you look at them.

I am so alone.. I am almost 20 and I have never been in a relationship before. I have only been rejected by 4 guys and 2 girls. One of them is my closest friend. He says that if I was a girl he would be with me. This makes me feel like I have to change myself in order to be his. Even then I still do not think he will be with me. I am in love with him because he is one of the only people who makes me feel like I matter. I just wonder if I am even going to have anyone in the future.. Dating websites/apps are also out of the question because no one wants to talk to me no matter how hard I try.,He says that if I was a girl he would be with me.

I do not eat because I do not want to eat alone I live at a school where the only place to eat is a cafeteria. I stopped going because I am always by myself. I already payed for the food and I do not have money to eat outside the caf so I just do not eat. God I feel like shit.,-
"I am sorry for the life I chose, I just want another chance I regret every decision I have made in my life, like to list the off not in order of reason or value to me but just randomly. I have really bad teeth because I just drunk alot of fizzy drinks and did not take care of them. Secondly this was because of that but I because shy and anxious all the time thinking about what people thought of me. So did not make many friends in school. Then during school my attention gravitated towards video games and my grades became shit. Therefore felt like university was not an option for me. I was taking to this girl I liked and she did not seem to bothered about my appearance more my personality but she was interested in someone else. I got really attached to her and ended up losing her and a good friend because I became too attached. I regret all of this 10 times over if I could relive my live I would regardless of the emotional scares and events that I went through",So did not make many friends in school.
"I am 2-3 years I will be moving to a state where purchasing a gun is easy. I will finally be able to successfully commit suicide. Been through 11 electroconvulsive therapy procedures (shock therapy), so many medications did not work, my psychiatrist and therapist gave up on me. I am exactly what you think I am, a fucking loser. A kissless, hugless, ugly, worthless virgin. It is said that the decision of suicide is an impulse, well what if I told you this impulse decision has been 7 years in the making. I am 20 now and man, it is time to take action.","It is said that the decision of suicide is an impulse, well what if I told you this impulse decision has been 7 years in the making."
"Beautifully Broken I have spent most of my life afraid to be my true self because I believed that if I did not live up to the standards and norms that I grew up with, I would not be accepted. I was told since a young age how I should act, talk, and dress. I was told that money was important and that attending societal events and bullshit balls was your key to social success. And those things, trying to feel important, had meant everything to me. But then life screws you over and suddenly your perspective on everything changes. I learned that I no longer wanted to be the person that everyone said I had to be and things that had once seemed important became trivial. I realized that I did not give a fuck if I had Tory Burch shoes or a Chanel bag. No amount of money could ever bring me happiness, which was clearly evident in the money that was spent on I am sorry shopping trips and my therapist. Things started falling apart at home when I was 15 years old. So my remedy to broken family was to drink until I could not feel. But despite my new fond love of alcohol and its pain killing effects, I kept my life together. I worked hard in school, I stayed active in my community, and I made sure people thought I was keeping it together. I could not let everyone know that I was a fucking mess. But in this process, I slowly lost myself and started living two different lives. When the curtains were wide open, people saw a girl that was very studious, had many accomplishment is, and always had a smile on her face. But as soon as the curtains closed and I was alone, my demons came out. And the more I hid, the more I lost myself. At one point, the alcohol was not enough. Things had only gotten worse at home and I needed a new escape. The first time I did it, it was a pair of scissors. It was small, barely noticeable. I had sworn after the first time that I would never hurt myself again. But eventually I did, and when I left for college it had only gotten worse. By my second year of college, I had reached my lowest point. I was in a toxic, emotionally abusive, relationship. I had a broken relationship with my parents, who spent most of their time stuck in a cycle of fighting, not speaking, and then pretending that they were okay. I had not spoken to my older brother, a struggling addict at the time, in almost a year. I no longer knew who I was. So one night I went out and bought a bottle of wine with my fake ID and went back to my apartment and chugged the entire thing. I sat on my bathroom floor crying, staring at the knife in my hand. And in the back of my mind I thought about the gun that was a few feet away from me hidden in a book that my dad had given me for protection. For the first time in my life, I had looked at mortality straight in the face. I had questioned it many times, but it was never like that night. Eventually the crying stopped and the numbness came, a feeling I had become all too familiar with. Would I do it? Could I do it? Would anyone care? I was consumed with darkness, but there was a small flicker of light, of hope. I wanted to help people, I wanted to one day to change the world, or at the very least change one person is life. I was not ready to leave just yet, so I held on to the tiny amount of hope that was left in me. I called the cops and was admitted into a psychiatric center. I spent 48 hours in a white walled, emotionless, prison like place. And not once did someone ask me if I was okay. My parents came up to see me and had a difficult time accepting what had happened and I did not understand why. They knew I wanted help, they saw the scars on my arms, and they knew that I was not okay. They blamed my relationship with my then boyfriend and told me to never speak of this to anyone. They did not want people to know I was crazy. Was I? During that time, I came to believe I was, but now I understand that I was just broken. It is been over three years since that happened and although I still struggled with a lot after that, I am now in a better place. The reason I am writing this is because I promised myself to one day help the 15-year-old me whose cries for help where tossed to the side, who was told she was over-dramatic and crazy, and who thought that cutting was the only way to cope. There was a reason I grew up surrounded by mental illness. I watched not only myself go through it, but I saw my brother, my parents, my friends, and so many people on the news struggling with their own demons. And this did not happen because life felt like fucking me over, it was just trying to show me what my reason for living is. I spent years ashamed of the person I was because I was scared to show people my true, raw, fucked up self. But is not that the problem? When it comes to having a mental illness, we believe the stigmas that come attached to it and we are afraid to speak up and talk about it. And the people who are lucky enough to not experience it, do not want to talk about it either. The only difference from how mental illness was treated a hundred years ago and now, is that we no longer hide and chain our family members in basements or attics, but the shame and embarrassment is still there. And I want to change that. I want to remove the stigmas and stereotypes attached to mental illness and get people talking. But change starts with me, and that means that I cannot be afraid to share my experiences. This is who I am and I would not change my life for anything in the world because now I truly understand what it is like to live with a mental illness. I finally know what the difference between sympathy and empathy is, and that is one of the greatest gifts that could have come out from this. I will be exploring different topics on mental illness while trying to find ways to change the way people think and talk about it. I will not only be looking at the psychological background of mental illness, but the neurological background as well. More and more scientists are publishing articles on different alternative treatments that do not involve medications. One of my favorite topics, which I will soon explore in more detail, is neuroplasticity, or the brains way of re-wiring itself to create new circuits, and essentially a new you. I have set a goal to one day create a facility for those who are afflicted with a mental illness. But instead of white walls, cold stares from employees, and isolation, they will be surrounded by beautiful colors, the outdoors, and people who actually care. Our current mental health system is completely and utterly fucked up. We cannot keep over-medicating people and throwing them out into the world with absolutely no regard for their actual well-being. If these treatments were actually working, we would not be seeing an alarmingly increasing rate of mental illness. It is time to re-define mental illness and stick a middle finger up to all the people who tell you that you are crazy or different. And maybe I am crazy, I am sure as hell different, but that does not make me any less of a person. I am proud of who I have become and now I know what the purpose of my life is, and I am not going to stop chasing it. -RBZ Sometimes the most beautiful people are beautifully broken -r.m. drake","Beautifully Broken I have spent most of my life afraid to be my true self because I believed that if I did not live up to the standards and norms that I grew up with, I would not be accepted.

I dont want to kill myself. I just do not want to exist I dont want to exist. I dont want to deal with all these emotions. I hate myself. I know people around me would no doubt benefit with me gone. I dont want to kill myself. It would just be another giant cost to my family who does not have much money to begin with. I am an accident. Nobody wants a fifth kid in their 40s. I was not meant to exist so why am I here? If I was not here maybe my parents could have bought a house instead of renting their whole life. Maybe buy a car that the bumper does not fall off on. Maybe they could have enough money to retire soon. I just wish I did not have to exist to be a burden on everyone,"I just do not want to exist I dont want to exist.

"My Daughter turned 30 today. I called and sent her a card, but she is not speaking to me. Reason being .. I have helped her and her husband financially for approximately 2 years with the child care payment for my lovely grand daughter (she is 3 years old). I explained to both of them (daughter and her husband), that I would have to quit paying half the payment (273.00 per month), after I get my 2005 tax return, because I am planning on buying a new car. I need a smaller car, and the one I own is from 1995 SUV. I gave my older car to my nephew in Arizona. He was driving a 1985 Toyota with no air conditioning. He is thrilled to recieved my 1995 Passport (Honda), that has many miles, but no serious problems. I was babysitting my lovely granddaughter one Saturday night. When they came home from a party. My son in law stunk of weed and he was drunk. He was hugging his daughter (my granddaughter), while he was stoned and drunk. I was so disappointed. I come from the old school that pot is bad. Being that my daughter was promoted to full time, and they both received a total of 2,00.00 tax return, I figure this is a good time to let them know that I will no longer be paying for half their child care. My daughter blames my decision on the night her husband was very stoned .. I tell her that I cannot expect ""the best"" for my granddaughter, when her own father does not care, as much as I do. Plus, I had forewarned her that I will be buying a car soon. So .. now I have a new car .. but no daughter, and not granddaughter. None of them are speaking to me.

"Medicines can and do stop working. I am going though this right now. I suffer from chronic depression. Had it since I was 5 and I am now 42 so I have been suffering for 37 years. God, I never realized how long it was! I sat in therapy for 4 years after my ex attempted to hang himself. I saved his life by taking him down from the noose with the help of my brother. The first words out of his mouth when he was out of his coma and the swelling went down was that it was all my fault. I knew then it was ME who needed the help. So for 4 years I sat in therapy and they never diagnosed me with chronic depression. If they did, they never told me or put me on medicines. When I switched therapists, that was when she said that I needed medicines. They gave me Prozac. That made a HUGE difference after the first 3 weeks. I took that for 6 years. Then I had gastric bypass surgery and when you have that, your body does not absorb the same so it stopped working. I took effexor for a while, did nothing, and now on celexa which is doing nothing at all. I am sitting here reading this forum and crying. So basically, medicines CAN stop working. Time to go get an adjustment.","Medicines can and do stop working.

"Told my mother I tried to kill myself, she admitted she also tried when i was a baby. I have been struggling with this sickness for a while, it cost me my job, and a few friends, but only now i can publicly say that i tried to kill myself on the 19th of February. I tried to hang myself with a belt, fortunatelly i bought a really shitty one at primark and the only thing it did was leave me on the floor gasping desperatelly for air, filled with a sense of failure and a huge shame. I have always been an outgoing, funny, talkative and very active guy and i just felt as is i runned out of batery like something was leaving me without lifeforce. After some therapy i decided to tell my mother about this. I went for a visit to my parents house and waited until we were alone to tell her basically what i have been writing above. Also told her that the biggest fear i had before doing it was that if i died my mother would also died just out of pure sadness. After we both cried for a while she dropped the bomb. She had been struggling with depression all her life without me or my sister knowing about it and it came a point where she even tried of doing the same. The thing that stopped her was their children and what we would do with 12 and 8 years alone. She also told me that my grandfather did not die of cancer, apparently he was an alcoholic, and when we where kids he threw himself at the well they had on the backyard. All this just made me realize that people do not kill themselves, depression kills people the same way cancer does. People who have not struggled with this cannot even imagine what is living with depression and often blame a person who is basically ill. My mother also gave me the best advice i have ever recieved. She told me that I was not on this earth just to find a job and live the best way i could just by buying things, that it did not matter if i did not find a huge reason to live; just by being there i was already the reason for my mother and many others to live and be happy, the same way she was for me.

I have never felt more alone in my life and I do not know what to do about it. I recently graduated high school with a decent amount of friends but have only really kept in touch with about 3 of them. I am going to a college two hours away so the likelihood that I will be able to even see those 3 people is kind of dwindling once I move. I used to deal with loneliness through friends on PlayStation but even those relationships feel like they are getting distant. I recently started talking to my former best friend from PS4 whom I have known for about 7 years but ever since he started seeing someone it feels like he is gotten meaner to me and does not care to be there for me in the same way anymore. I am not sure if I am depressed but I have never felt more alone or lost or confused in my life. I have managed to convince myself that I have no redeeming qualities and that my friends are only pretending to like me because they feel bad or somehow feel obligated to maintain a facade of friendship. I just want to feel important to someone. Or at least okay enough with myself that I do not need the validation of a relationship to feel valuable.,I am not sure if I am depressed but I have never felt more alone or lost or confused in my life.
"Why am I like this? Every time I try to step out of my comfort zone and try to be more outgoing/""normal"" so people will think a little better of me perhaps, I just completely fuck everything up. I do not even feel like leaving my bed anymore. Why I am posting this right niw: I somehow convinced a girl that I am not a complete idiot, and we are together. Since she is ill, I thought I would swing by and give her a little ""get well soon"" kit with soup, tea, chocolate, that kinda stuff. All that came back was a half assed thank you, no comment on anything in the damn thing I have planned for a week now. I did not expect much reaction, since she does not seem to like spending time with me anyways, but a little more would have been nice. I guess I am just bad at everything I touch. And since I do not have any friends to talk to, I have to bother you nice people with this. Sorry you had to read this far, just continue scrolling now.

"Recently single due to my depression and i do not know how to feel. I have had depression a majority of my life, it comes and goes a lot, but as of recently it is really hit hard. I have lost all motivation to finish college and live life outside of my house. I was dating somebody for a year and half, until my depression started to affect our relationship, she could not handle the pressure of it all. It is been three weeks since the break up and my emotions are all out of wack. One minute I am crying for my ex and the next I am spacing out, looking at the ceiling.

"I cannot do this anymore. I cannot keep telling myself I am happy. I cannot keep ignoring the pain! The constant pain..it will not go away..always there, a sharp knife in my heart. Day in and day out it hurts, whether I am happy or not, it hurts. I cannot do this anymore. All I want is for the pain to end..just end! I have nothing. Not a friend in the entire world who cares. Do you know what it is like to have no friends? Not one at all who can be there for me. I have got nothing to stand on anymore, nothing to cling to. I have got no reason to live left in me. I do not even have religion anymore. Christian, Buddhist..I am not either, I am nothing..I have no faith in afterlife, I just want to die. I cannot keep living like this..I cannot keep living. I am nothing..I have lost all hope, I have nothing but despair..nothing but constant pain, constant fear, constant hurt. I cannot go on like this, even physical pain is better than this.

I am afraid to be in a relationship I say this because every guy who has asked me out. I just say no. I just panic and say no but I become friends with them. Then when our friendship ends because I ruined it. I feel so alone and depressed for days. Just from me writing this. It shows I am not fit to be in a relationship with anyone or my depression will make me feel like I am in so much pain. Then I also hate being alone like it would just be nice for one day to be hugged all day by a guy. I would feel more relaxed and just forget about so many things.,It shows I am not fit to be in a relationship with anyone or my depression will make me feel like I am in so much pain.
"How do you get up and out of bed in the morning? I am sorry if this is the wrong subreddit but I do not really know where to post for motivational tips or tricks. I have done everything suggested on Google searches like putting your alarm clock across the room, setting daily goals, and trying to get myself excited for the next day but I would gladly just lay in bed all day. I am a college student majoring in Finance. I am not the best student but honestly I only care about getting my degree. GPA means nothing more than having the requirements to walk across the stage.

"I am new here, and I ought for help. For the past month I have had a crush on this girl .. but not a normal crush .. a real CRUSH CRUSH, the type of crush you really feel you need her since the first time you see her. She is my friend as of right now, I want to ask her out .. but I am afraid she rejects me, and she would not be my friend anymore. I have been with depression for the past 4 days already, I even had suicidal thoughts. Last night I was looking for a HotLine to call and tell my story, I felt like I needed to talk to somebody. I have friends, but not those type of friends that you can rely on, tell your story, and cry on their shoulders. Basically, i am by myself in this world. I love my parents, but I never tried talking about it because I just cannot. They would not understand, they ask too many questions .. we even had a minor discussion about me telling my mom NOT to throw the water bottle (I told her 5 times not to throw it), and guess what she did .. she threw the water bottle .. and she told ""rrAhh, you should have told me"" .. Bad communication indeed, she needs to pay more attention to what I say. I have not eaten for a day because the depression has gotten worse .. last night a good ""cyber - friend"" logged on, and I knew I could talk to that person .. she is not kid, she is a grown woman (40 years old), she has kids, so I knew she would understand perfectly. She talked me into not thinking about suiciding because of that. Last night was the day that I cried the most, in my entire life. I am still depressed, a little bit relieved because I actually talked to someone and let all that out. I just need advices, I have been thinking of that girl ALL the time .. I wrote her letters as a ""secret admirer"", the ending of the letter was always the same: ""To the world you might be one person, but to one person you might be the world."" I was also thinking that I was going to ask her out .. but like I said above, I am afraid she might reject me and I fall into a deeper depression. Please help, what should I do? I am 16, and I live in Miami. Thank you if you have read my story. EDIT: I have lost my self - respect, and lowered my self - esteem, and feel like if I am a nobody.","I am new here, and I ought for help.

"Not fearing any consequences for our actions? ""Not fearing any consequences or not fearing anything"" is one of the feelings I have observed in myself. I am not able to study well, yet when test comes, I have no fear of the consequences of the failing tests, even though I am certainly failing it. Same with my other habits, I eat like once in a day, which is an obligation I have put on myself to do at least once. Even then its very less than what any normal person of my age eats. I barely get 4-6 hours of sleep due to my schedule and not able to sleep quickly at night. I know its not healthy, but are not we supposed to do these things by fearing what will happen to ourselves? I think I have lost the fear of consequences of my actions. Does anyone have this kind of experience?",Not fearing any consequences for our actions?
"Hello everyone, I am new here. I am Sarah and in my early thirties. I live in Europe and found this forum today! I just want to share my thoughts and because I was afraid anyone would find out about my feelings I searched for a foreign forum. And found it! I have been struggling all my life but after a series of events (death of dear aunt and suicide attempt off parent) I found myself starting therapy almost 2 years ago. At first everything was fine and I was learning a lot about myself and how to make my life easier and how to love myself. i really was hopeful and thought my life would finally get happier and maybe I would even meet some one to share my life with.. After a year of therapy I started feeling worse about myself and developed an eating disorder and a few months ago I also started feeling more and more depressed. At first I denied everything and even threatened to quit therapy because I was convinced time would heal me..well I now know that healing is not that easy. over the past two weeks I have been to a psychiatrist who wants to start me on Prozac (because it should not make me gain weight, she thinks this would be the best ad. for me) and earlier this week i went to see my usual psychotherapist who said I was severely depressed and she urged me to start taking the medication because of my state of mind. I might loose my job in the near future and with all this extra stress my thoughts have been very scary. I am starting to think more and more about death and for this reason my therapist started talking about hospitalization! Off course I do not want that so I agreed earlier today to start with the medication..I am so scared about the side effects and do not know what i will do if I gain weight. Also I do not think I want to life if I loose my job..I think that will push me over the edge. I hope I can find the energy to read more messages on this board and maybe get a good feeling about life again. Bye for now, Sarah","I am Sarah and in my early thirties.

"Hi all.. this is going to be a long post, but I would really like some feedback on it.. I am kind of young, 17. I am currently involved in a relationship (long distance) with a boy who is a year older than me, and I love him more than words can say. The thing is, though, I am a very depressed person sometimes. I do not know if I am making this up or if I actually read this somewhere, but I am what I have heard classified as a ""seasonally"" depressed person: I experience depression more during the winter months (December through February) than I do any other time of the year. I have a lot of family problems that compound to my depression as well. When I was 13, I moved halfway across the country and I never accepted living here. I am a city-girl, but I moved to the country. I feel isolated and alone out here, and I do not have anyone to talk to. My mother told me to ""buck up"" and ""get over it"" when I went to her about my depression a couple of years ago. She is currently on medication for her own depression. My father has a crippled arm (which he gained when we moved here) and has some addiction problems, so I do not go to him. I have a very hard time trusting people. My mother and father were both abused as children, and my mother verbally abuses me. Recently, starting in about December, I started wanting to hurt myself physically again. The urge faded, but the depression lingered. For a while I have been emulating my mother on my boyfriend--I keep taking out my own anger and my own depression on him. I am afraid that if I keep up with this behavior, I am going to lose my boyfriend to my own selfishness. A lot of the time I wish I could disappear. I do not like being seen by people and I like to be alone, but at the same time I feel isolated in my soul. I tried religion, but I cannot bring myself to place my faith in something I cannot see. I am really afraid that my depression is going to cause me to lose the one thing I even care about at all anymore in the world. I do not know what to do. My parents will not help me, my teachers do not know how to deal with it, and I have been to depression forums like this before and they really helped. I guess all I am looking for is someone to lean on while I get through the winter months. If anyone has any suggestions for a homebody (my parents do not allow me to leave the house after school is over), please let me know. Also keep in mind that I cannot call people very easily with eavesdropping people in my house. Thanks. Sarina","The thing is, though, I am a very depressed person sometimes.

"This message is especially for newcomers desperately seeking a way out of the depression rut. Please read my words carefully as a lot of thought and devotion went into this: A year ago, I was stuck in the miserable rut of depression with little or no hope of finding a way out. I was attending mandatory group therapy after an attempted suicide and 72 miserable hours in the nut house. They put me on Remeron which helped a little .. taking some of the edge off the suicidal thoughts, but little else. Weeks of trying to learn cognitive behavior therapy went by and hopes of getting better were dwindling. Then one day, my best friend gave me a book which taught me how to properly apply the CBT. Many of you have tried CBT to no avail. I sincerely believe that you did not do it either properly, hard enough, and / or long enough. When retraining the mind, it is vitally important to diligently apply CBT daily for several weeks. (See my webpage for more info: Antidepressant That Works). Once this becomes a regular habit, I am confident you will see improvement as I did. I am positive you can do it too. It was the toughest job I have ever had to do, but it sure was worth it. Whenever a negative situation presents itself now, I just block it out and replace it with a positive thought automatically. It is hard in the beginning, but it is totally do - able. Plus, it gets easier after awhile. Then, once it becomes automatic, you do not even have to think about it. Properly applied CBT helps tremendously, but it is not a complete cure as you will see in my story. You must also take care of your body because it is what furnishes your brain with the proper nutrients. The two go hand in hand. The brain regulates the endocrine system and the neurotransmitters while the body provides the brain with the proper chemicals to do its job. Leisure activities help also. I know it is difficult for some of you to have fun, but it is important to get your mind off your problems even if just for a little while. I mention motivation in my story. Sometimes you just have to force yourself to do what is good for you even if you do not want to. Contrary to what many believe, motivation begins with action .. not visa - versa. The sooner you begin to properly apply the techniques I learned and the more effort you put in to them, the sooner you will get better. Hopelessness and doubt will be your enemy, so try to put them aside for a month as you get on the road to wellness. I have been off antidepressants for almost a year now. I feel great .. plus my concentration and comprehension are back. March 5 marked my one year anniversary without alcohol too. I am basically drug free and am as happy as I was 5 years ago before the depression nearly ruined my life.","Please read my words carefully as a lot of thought and devotion went into this: A year ago, I was stuck in the miserable rut of depression with little or no hope of finding a way out.

I have been on antidepressant medication on and off for about 4 years now (initially Aropax, now Aurorix), in hindsight I have actually suffered from depression for my entire life. I am a similar personality to my mother who also suffers from depression. My younger brother and sister seem to have drawn the long straw as such, they seem not to be affected. Things went downhill for me about the time I started on medication. I was in the early stages of a major gambling problem, and untreated depression had led to a real strain on my marriage. We split up for 3 months (during which time I made 2 lame suicide attempts), reunited and seemed to get back on track, having our first child. Throughout this time the gambling problem intensified, and spiraled out of control to the point where I am now a bankrupt. During this time I also became extremely withdrawn to the point where I hate leaving our house and am more or less unable to cope with spending time with anyone except my wife and daughter. I also had something of a breakdown about 9 months ago, quit my job, which led to great tension between me and my wife (spending 24 / 7 together), eventually she could not cope and moved out. Shortly after we worked it out and I moved in with her. Things seem pretty good now, we are a lot more relaxed about things and we just seem to get along better, looking forward very much to the birth of our second, in about 6 weeks time. My gambling problem is pretty much dealt with (thanks chiefly to having little money and no access to it now) but I am still depressed, withdrawn and generally tired of life. To be honest, I am only around because of my wife and daughter, I feel little reason to exist other than for them. I am also a christian and this is very hard, because there is a real burden of ""I should not feel this way, I should be happy"". This leads to more depression, and at the moment I am reluctant to go to church, I do not pray or read the bible. I am generally resentful of anyone who I consider to have a better existence than me (which is just about everyone). So while things are quite stable at home, I personally am at my lowest point in some respects. I am quite intelligent and every employer I have ever had has commented on my abundance of potential but lack of drive. So true, I lack any kind of ambition (and harbor something of an extreme opposition to materialism and the pursuit of money and possessions) and even now am tossing up whether to continue working. I have a chief interest (i.e. motorsport), but other interests have been decimated e.g. I used to be quite a good pianist but now have absolutely no desire to play. I also cannot get the motivation up to get involved in playing sport, which in the past has been a big part of my life. So that is me in a nutshell. My extreme difficulty in taking on face to face help / relationships has driven me to get involved in some online depression forums as I think this may be a good way for me to start some kind of recovery.","I was in the early stages of a major gambling problem, and untreated depression had led to a real strain on my marriage.

"Things that I liked about today so far **Maybe the only way to escape depression is gratitude. Cicero, one of the senators of Rome in the early days of the empire is quoted to have said ""Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others."" I liked waking up early and going to the gym on an intense pre workout. I like stepping outside in the cold to smoke and feel the warmth when I re-enter the building. I like seeing the trees trying to survive the winter, how splendorous they are. In them I see people going through hard times and the beauty that exists within them. I liked logging on to Runescape to escape reality for a couple of hours and talking to my friends on there. The fact that we have escapes is an amazing thing. I liked seeing three girls meet each other outside and say ""Hii how are youu?"" and compliment each other. Instead of normally being irritated by that, I actually admired that people in reality share bonds and happiness with each other is presence, and it made me happy to see that. I like the complexity of the mathematics that I am doing and the fact that I am doing it. I like having a planned meeting with a group of people today for my class presentation in college. I like having a picture of a God who constantly forgives and is deeply saddened by our unhappiness that becomes to hard to bear for some, versus a picture of an angry Colonel with zero mercy. I like the fact that I have a place to resort to to write down the thoughts streaming from my mind. I like the caprese sandwich I am eating, with melted mozzarella, tomato, red peppers, pesto sauce.","Things that I liked about today so far **Maybe the only way to escape depression is gratitude.

"Anyone elses depression feel like this? Good day, This might be weird but stick with me. I suffered/suffer from depression. Basically from middle school to about a year ago when I finally started on medication. The best way I could describe my depression is voices in my head saying mean and awful things to me, about me, about what other people are thinking or saying about me, turning positives into negatives etc. I started playing a game called Hellblade Senua is Sacrifice tonight and the their is a theme around psychosis, and the main character has many voices in her head. Here is the opening, (possible trigger warning?), As soon as I heard all the voices calling Senua names, putting her down, laughing at her etc. I was like holy shit that was me. I am not trying to say I have/had psychosis, I just thought that the voices thing felt like what I went through. My voice, telling me terrible things, spinning stories, like someone else in my head, working against me. Anyone else feel like Senua/me?","I am not trying to say I have/had psychosis, I just thought that the voices thing felt like what I went through.

"So fucking lonely.. I have been feeling so unbearably lonely lately and it feels like it is never going to end too. It does not make it any easier that my roommate has been sleeping with some of my best friends and the rest of my friends are all getting girlfriends and boyfriends. I have been really trying to put myself out there too which is why it is so crushing every time I see a friend of mine go on a date with someone they just met, but every time I try to ask a girl on a date she just stops responding to me..I feel like there is something deeply wrong with me and I do not know what it is!! I really just want to die, I am so sick of getting rejected and feeling like I am never going to be loved.",I have been feeling so unbearably lonely lately and it feels like it is never going to end too.
"I lost my best friend. My best friend used to always be there for me, he was the barnyard kind of personality, with tonnes of love and compassion for everyone around him, and along him was excitement and exploration. We used to explore the woods together and sometimes sit and stare at the campfire for hours until we fell asleep together. His name was Archer, he was my cat, and he was my best friend. A woodland animal killed him, he was defenseless.. I have tried with different cats to fill the empty void, but they were never aware of me. Archer was always where I was, and were going. I cry every time I lay down in bed, look to my side and expect a short purr and a hop to my lap.. now there is nothing.","His name was Archer, he was my cat, and he was my best friend."
"People are NOT who they seem. I originally wrote a long post detailing the specifics of what just happened to me, but I decided not to. All I am saying is, **do not** trust anybody. You have **zero** assurance that people who act nice and fine when you are around are really nice and fine towards you when your back is turned. I would not have known the true, judgmental, and frankly I have no fucking idea where in the ass of God did they pull all their judgmental shit - if I had not snooped and read text messages of my mother to other people. Hell, my own mother is in it, too! ""Hide the knife, he might stab our son (my stepfather)."" ""You are sick, go to a doctor for a checkup. You cannot give up, please do not die. We pity your son. He cannot survive without you. He will burn all the money with booze. He will be homeless and sleep on the streets."" Jesus Fucking Christ. What in the actual fuck? I do not even drink. Jesus Christ. What the fuck. The judgment. Dear fucking Christ I could not believe nor comprehend how this people even came to whatever bullshit thought/idea they came to. Suddenly, I am back down to self-doubt and I can feel depression clawing at me, it is trying to rip me apart again. But, no more. I am pushing it back. I have confirmed EVERYTIME, that family is my main source of toxicity. FUCK THAT. I am being ganged up on by everyone in this house, and their relatives, and every single one of my relatives. I once questioned if I was the one at fault. I mean, if EVERYBODY hated you, you are probably doing something wrong. UNLESS, you are just that damn unlucky and every single one of your relative is a fucking asshole. I have heard of those stories before, so it is not impossible - and I think that is the case with me. Jesus. For now, I am playing the game they wanna play. They wanna be fake with me, I will be fake with them. I act all fine and dandy around my mother and everyone else. I smile, I joke. All a facade. So when the right time comes, when I can finally burn bridges with them, **it will fucking hurt mom.** Mom, yes. Because everyone else would be glad I am gone. But, my mother, will hopefully finally realize her fucking mistake and die a fucking failure of a mother.","I would not have known the true, judgmental, and frankly I have no fucking idea where in the ass of God did they pull all their judgmental shit - if I had not snooped and read text messages of my mother to other people.

"I have been on many medications in the past. I was on Cymbalta last year for about a year. Then I had a relapse and depressed again. I changed to Effexor. The meds never really work for me, I think maybe I am medication - resistant. Maybe it is working and I do not realize, and maybe I would be much worse without the meds?? Has anyone tried both Cymbalta, and Effexor? Which one helped more? or are they about the same. Should I go back to Cymbalta?? Has anyone quit a medication, tried something else, then went back to that same medication? or should I try a different medication all together? In past, I have tried Zoloft, Lexapro (allergic), I am on Wellbutrin now with Effexor, also tried Paxil, Luvox, and Celexa.","Has anyone tried both Cymbalta, and Effexor?

"Coping With Depression with False Laughter Does anyone here try to combat their depression with laughter and jokes when dealing with people? I have been known by my friends to be the jokester, the guy that makes people laugh. What none of them know is that I do it because I am trying hard to not to feel depressed, and I will try to make a joke out of a lot of stuff. Sarcasm is my friend. It makes me feel good for a little while, but eventually the happy feeling from laughter returns to feeling like crap.","What none of them know is that I do it because I am trying hard to not to feel depressed, and I will try to make a joke out of a lot of stuff."
"Well I am 13 so please excuse my grammar and spelling. Well it started almost about.. 1.3 yr ago. I started to get large mood swings and would end up being sad or feeling guilty nearly everyday. That is when i discovered cutting myself. It started off as what does it feel like then grew into and addiction. I used to be doing it nearly everyday. IT made/makes me feel like there is nothing wrong. Well this grew bigger and bigger and i did not tell anyone about it. After about 8 months i started to lie to myself and say everything was fine, It worked. Only temporarily. Around 3 months ago the feelings came back and i still have them at this moment. I have researched a lot about clinical depression. I still cut and i hate it. I came right out to my parents and said ''Maybe i enjoy cutting myself"" when we were in a huge fight. My dad turned around and said ""we do not care if you cut yourself"". This definitely did not help. So right now i have one person i can talk to about it and has a good friend of mine. I checked the symptoms of clinical depression on Answers.com and i have 12/13 of them. I need to go see a doctor i know but i just cannot. There is something stopping me and i do not know what it is. I just want to solve it on my own but i cannot. I need Help. I have also been thinking about committing suicide and doing drugs but my friends that know i cut are stopping me. I know i will be missed. I just cannot live on anymore.. I cannot see myself living past 18. Can anyone relate to this?

"I do not want to be an adult anymore. I have been struggling with my depression a lot lately and I really really wish I could turn to one of my parents to tell them how much I am struggling. More importantly, I wish I could tell one of them and one of them cared. I know I am a decent disappointment to both of them for several reasons. 1) I have not had a decent job. I have been floating on jobs that get me less than five hours a week. 2) I do not have friends. Granted, that is because my mother literally and intentionally isolated me so I have no social skills at all. 3) I have big dreams but zero motivation in life so I cannot even try to achieve them. So what I am trying to do is work on myself. Today I started a new (third, I now have three of these stupid things) job. I thought I did pretty good considering the store did not burn down and no one told me that I was a failure. But literally as soon as the sun set, I feel all my doubt and darkness telling that I am lying to myself. That I am being naive by thinking that I did well, that I was probably a huge burden to everyone else in the store. But I am trying, so that has to count for something right? I went and got a third job on my own, so why do not I feel like I should be proud of myself? I have no friends. In fact, during 2017, I was so excited to have made a great friend and I was completely betrayed by them. The kind of betrayal where I walked away from a friendship and have not bothered reading the apologies they have sent me. I have tried reconnecting with friend that I had earlier in life, but I am not doing so well. I feel like they will do something to me and then I will lose another friend. And logically, if I am the only common factor in all my failed friendships, then I must be the problem, right? I must be the problem. I am the problem. Maybe I am not meant to have friends. And I have always had big dreams for myself. But because of how I was raised, I have no accountability. Because seriously, why bother trying if everything I do is going to be met with disapproval and anger? So I have been trying really hard to make myself follow at least one goal. I chose to go for my art. Problem being that with my depression crashing on me in waves, I am really struggling to stick to my goal of one art post a day. I am trying really hard but I am so afraid that I will be the failure I was taught to be. In all of this, I just really really wish I could quit trying to be an adult and go back to the days when I believed my mom when she said she loved me, I want to go back to when my dad wanted to help me talk things out so I could figure out what I was doing. I want to be able to call my mom up and tell her that I feel like a complete failure and that I cannot add to see my therapist and that I need help talking the darkness down. But if I call her, she will one-up me because I am the biggest mistake of her life. Or worse, she will tell me that I should try (fill in the blank with whatever bs Facebook depression fix is trending). I want to be able to call my mom and say hey, I got another job and I am excited. I want her to tell me that she is proud of me. I really want to have a conversation with my dad that does not involve the phrase well get over it. 'Hey dad, I am full of regret and turmoil' 'ugh just get over it' well excuse me sir for being by the reality that I just pulled a mulan and cut all my hair off so that I could get another job. I went from having shoulder length hair that made me feel good about myself to hair that is half an inch long and highlights everything about my face that gives me horrible anxiety. Maybe I am really hurting because I went in to work yesterday and two of my managers greeted me with 'ew gross, what happened to your hair?' And now I feel like I am as ugly as I think I am. I really miss being a kid when I could pretend that my world was not on fire or that I was not drowning. And I do not know how to make any of the darkness back up so that I can breathe. I really wish that I could see my therapist this week.","3) I have big dreams but zero motivation in life so I cannot even try to achieve them.

"I really need help making friends I am 25, living with my parents. I recently quit my job, hoping to ease my depression but it only made it worse since I have nothing to distract me now. I lost touch with all of my high school friends after graduation, and did not make any friends in college. I spend my days walking my dog, reading wikipedia articles, youtube, etc. I have not spoken to another person since Monday. I just stay in my room and my parents do not come in.

"Desperate for advice or input; I lost and am losing everything held dear to me right now due to multiple reasons, and would just like to hear some different recommendations I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DONT KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG OR HOW TO FEEL BETTER!! I have typed this out way too many times so I am gonna do my best to sum it up as short as I can: Last week me and my gf of 10 and a half months broke up, i was devestated. In that little time I have experienced more love, more of life than ever before and it felt like we would been together forever. I thought, maybe we would work things out on our own and get back together when the time was right, even though i knew it was a stretch, but i was also okay with just being friends if that was what the world had planned. 2 days after the break up im talking to both of my best friends who are also (kinda?) friends with her, and they both tell me that she basically told them she had absolutely no intention of ever getting back with me because she wanted to ho around without the commitment of a relationship. She also openly bragged to one of them that she had cheated on me multiple times during our relationship. This all made me very angry and on top of that hurt. The same night just after finding all of this out I find out from my other friend that she had called her and bragged about hooking up with this one kid who, during our entire relationship, she told me she hated and that we BOTH already had bad history with, and fooled around. Then later (AGAIN) she goes on instagram live with my bestfriend who is kinda being fake just to see how she really is and openly brags about blocking me (which added to the hurt cause i had done nothing but try to respect her wishes since the split in hopes that we could at least part on good terms ya know) , saying that i was 'fucking crazy' and that she never wanted anything to do with me ever again. There is more in terms of details but thats the basic general idea of the past week for me. I dont know how i feel or what to say. I feel hurt and i feel abandoned and i feel stupid and i feel not good enough and i feel like a complete fuck up i feel so fucking awful its not even funny. Im losing my friends because my stupid brain cant get over this and im constantly going to them to talk about it because that is the way i like to deal with stuff, but they have heard the same thing one too many times and i get that i just dont know what else to do. Im tired of thinking about it, im tired of not being able to confront her but my friends say its not a good idea because its not gonna do anything but make her think even higher of herself for having fucked me up so badly and wont at all make her change her ways. I want to completely forget but at the same time a part of me wants to work everything out just so i can mean something to this person who meant absolutely everything to me at one point again, WHY?? Why does my brain, or heart, or whatever still crave attention from her, or maybe even her herself, even after knowing all of this? Why am i so fucking pathetic? What can I do to move on that does not involve just ignoring the problem and moving forward but rather coming to peace with it and myself and blossoming? Please, all and every opinion or suggestion is welcome. Thank you if you took the time to read this and I wish everybody the best of luck with your own problems no matter what they be. May peace of mind and soul find you all.","2 days after the break up im talking to both of my best friends who are also (kinda?) friends with her, and they both tell me that she basically told them she had absolutely no intention of ever getting back with me because she wanted to ho around without the commitment of a relationship.

"My latest depression has a cure, and it is my girlfriend. So this is my story about a severe depression and anxiety I have been experiencing these months. TLDR, we kinda broke up back in April, we had some issues regarding me being a prick. But, she forgave me as we have a perfect relationship (that is right, I do think it is marvelous). But for some important reason that I do not wanna give details in, we cannot be together anymore. So, I started having anxiety attacks, and all my world was like hell, it was so bad, I felt like I had to do something about it. Anyways, I am fighting to be back again with her, and she also is waiting for me. We all dream about things or situations where we would allegedly be happy with: money, being successful.. all that kind of stuff. Here is what I have learned: When I dream about all this stuff, at the end the only thing, I mean, my only desire, the only thing that I crave in this world, and which I would be crushed to not have, is her. I am a person who deeply depends on others, I previously gave myself into deep friendships, but after all, and after all experience, my only friendship and relationship I am keeping with is my girlfriend. She literally is my everything regarding my happiness, and me being alive. Here is the summary: I wanna go back with my girlfriend, and I am depressed and sad if I am not with her. I know we will be hopefully soon together, but as the meantime, I feel like my days are worthless and my life is meaningless.","Here is what I have learned: When I dream about all this stuff, at the end the only thing, I mean, my only desire, the only thing that I crave in this world, and which I would be crushed to not have, is her.

"My boring sob story Family members told me all the time that being an adult is shit and I should make the most of being a kid. So when depression hit me I thought it was normal, but it did not feel right. I was not upset all the time, it was just like a flat misery sort of feeling. Things started to feel odd for me, certain sounds and smells and silly things like the wind of my face felt wrong. Like they would be toned down somehow. Eventually I became completely disconnected from my emotions, save for the occasional moment when I actually find something funny. I have been on two types of medication and had therapy too, neither of which did anything for me. I did not notice myself become so gradually withdrawn from everything. Now going to the shop or getting the bus is something I would rather not do. Things I would do every day. My social life went backwards as well as my social skills. Now I am afraid to talk to people. I literally reject girls I am interested in on the spot, before I even have chance to fuck it up myself. Things that I would do without thinking now take encouragement and energy. Then came the cynicism. Belief that nobody out there was pure and everything they did was for their own personal gain. Suppose it is true in a sense but I wish I did not have this paint everybody with the same brush mindset. It is hard to believe I am the same person at times. It is been 7 years now and I have had enough. Just dunno what to do. I feel like I have tried everything. Ca not help but feel I am partly responsible, for buying into the shit I told myself.","I was not upset all the time, it was just like a flat misery sort of feeling.

Just a rant So today my parents came from NY to pick up the kids from me as I will be leaving the country for 6ish months soon. My soon to be ex wife leaves to move back to Japan tomorrow. This girl I started to hang out with and we both seem into each other but she has reservations about anything serious bc we work together just informed me that she is pretty much busy until I leave the country..which does coincide with one of her best friends moving as well..awful timing I know. I just feel so alone..my kids are gone..my marriage is done (im actually happy about this after months of depression)..and the person who i had started to grow closer too said we cant really hangout (probably) before I leave :/. Sorry i know others have more bigger problems but these are mine.,Just a rant So today my parents came from NY to pick up the kids from me as I will be leaving the country for 6ish months soon.

"Alright, I have been here before, to this site and this depressed on life. I have experience that would get any person out of depression and live a pretty well rounded life. Only to be honest I sometimes choose i think to be down and out all the time. I was in recovery from a drug problem for 2 years and i developed a relationship with a Higher Power that really really helped with my depression / anxieties / addictions. So it would be insane for someone who knows the solution to not use it right? Well i have heard it said before, that once someone who had great faith loses it it makes it more difficult for that person to find hope or faith, so that is where i have been the past 2 1/2 months, hopeless. I tried Heroin after 2 years clean. Looking for something to shut my mind up and find some comfortable peace due to my increasing loneliness and depression. I only got real sick for about the two weeks i was on it and lost a job and apartment. Then i moved back with my mom who has deep anger at my dad and life i guess who is with a man that is using her in my opinion, he is in a halfway house and just lays on her couch all day. And my dad has deep depression / bipolar on every medication you could think of and lives with his mom who only talks about ""the divorce"" and how ""i should have did this different"" So really if i look at it long enough and deep enough they are alive but dead in a healthy emotional, spiritual, mental level, so where is the encouragement or love i so long needed as a younger person, and even most importantly i need some guidance now, instead of being ashamed of who they are. I just need to vent. I am 22 i just started college last week and i am extremely anxious when there, I feel as though i wear a suit, outfit, costume of misery, fear, depression, THE VOID. So it drives others away, plus i am ashamed of being a depressive / anxious dude so keeping others away is my aim. I mean i am 22 i should be getting laid and having fun right?! Man i feel so old but so immature emotionally. I talked to a friend of mine that is at Yale in Connecticut last night who has always been a good natured, smart, artistic guy, and a person who experiences depression but does not let it get the best of him, and he said to not dwell in the negative like i have always done, find something through out the day that is positive, a girl smiles at you, a song whatever. MAN, I cannot just turn my mind off from negative thoughts of me and others.","I have experience that would get any person out of depression and live a pretty well rounded life.

"I really need some advice *trigger warning* *trigger warning* Hi everyone. I am sorry if I am doing this wrong. This is my first time visiting this subreddit, and so I do not know what is generally expected or done on here. Let me just get into this. I am 22 and I have never experienced depression. I am a Psychology major and I have taken classes over the topic, but I know reading about it can only give me so much insight. The reason I am posting on here is because I have a 12 year old cousin who tried cutting herself the other day. She is depressed, says she wants to die, and I am so, so worried about her. She lives a few hours from me and is being watched closely right now, but I plan on going out to visit her this weekend. To be honest, she has a horrible living situation. My aunt (her mom) is awful. To my aunt, every problem can be solved by God, she is financially fucked and letting it out on my cousins, and she is extremely dismissive of my cousins feelings, needs, and emotions. It also does not help that my cousin is adopted, and I know she just feels detached from her own family. Anyways, I know that there is no such thing as simply getting your advice on how to fix my cousins depression. I know how complex of an issue this is. What I want to know from you all is if there is anything I can do this weekend to just show her that things can get better. My little cousin has always looked up to me, and I plan on taking her out to do some of the things that she always wants to do (like go to the park, make slime, whatever 12 year olds like). But is there anything extra I can do? Is there anything that you all wish someone told you? Or maybe even something you wish they did not? I would really appreciate any tips or advice you all have for me this weekend. I know my cousin has a very long road ahead of her, but I want to do anything I can to make it easier. Thank you. tlr my 12 year old cousin is depressed and attempting to hurt herself. I am going to visit her this weekend. Is there anything I can do (or should not do), that might at least show her that things can get better.","It also does not help that my cousin is adopted, and I know she just feels detached from her own family.

"Besides the issue with the jealousy which is probably related to this thread there are other things which you all may or may not relate to. i am 24 years old but am feeling a huge burden to accomplish things from my boyfriend, parents and society in general. Not to say that i do not want to accomplish things .. i most definitely do thing is that i am not sure what area i should be focusing on. i am in school currently for dancing and though i feel competitive i am losing focus once again. i get bored easily and always want to try new things. which makes it impossible to advance at any one thing. i also enjoy writing and singing. i love singing actually but am not sure what or how to do anything with it. while some expect me to use my college degree to get a regular job .. which i am starting to think is what i should do, others think i should waitress and do what it takes to advance creatively. all in all i am stuck. i am on my spring break and am doing nothing, i need a job and though i feel i need to go out and do something, i am really depressed. how can i get out of this rut i am in. and actually start doing things when i am not even sure what it is i want to do?","Not to say that i do not want to accomplish things ..

"It feels as if I am heading towards a dark place Hey, have not been here before but I had a quick scroll and this feels like the right sub to vent to. I am 18 from the UK, I have had a rough educational life (I alway talked, went in high with my friends, got in minor trouble that kinda thing). I fucked up college in the second year of my 2 year diploma course and got excluded for the same kind of shit previously mentioned but on a larger scale, this really fucked me up as I thought I would end up doing nothing with my life when I really wanted to do something with it. 10 weeks ago I got a job and a paid for graduates course which pays out over 1100 per month after tax which is incredible for me, it is a job I love, work hard at and it is exactly the path I want to take in life career-wise. So I have been given a second start, I have money, great friends, a good social life and my life is on track but I still cannot quite feel complete. I am very social anxious and this affects my everyday life but I push through it, I have to. I smoke week almost everyday and I have been smoking for about 5 years now. The problem is, I still have a void that I cannot fill and I can never really feel that happy by myself. I love my metal and I am a huge music fan, I used to play a lot of games but I have stopped caring so much now. Sometimes I find it hard to enjoy things as much as I used to. I feel exhausted at home as I do not sleep much and the anxiety takes it out of me until I walk through the door. It feels as if it is getting worse and I do not know what to do and I do not even know why I feel this way. Sometimes it can get quite bad where I will not even feel like doing anything but pulling bongs with the TV on in the background as the day is just too much to handle sometimes. Sry for the huge wall of text but I am trying to get this typed quick as I am about to go out. I do not even know why I am posting this really, I want to vent, maybe I want advise.

"I am a hetero man, 35, divorced, no kids. I can honestly say that I feel empathy towards any guy who suffers from depression. Some of my closest guy friends have admitted to me their many bouts of battling these demons, just as I have shared my horror stories and near suicidal incidents, and we all have empathy with each other over that stuff. I am beginning to not give a crap anymore about depression being viewed as just a ""woman"" issue; it is what it is and to heck with gender stereotypes. The things I have noticed the most are my friends' unwillingness to consult a therapist or take medication, but perhaps their bouts of depression are not the ""bed-ridden"" variety that I have gone through. Or maybe this is their way of not feeling ""completely weak"". Most of my friends will either drink excessively or take drugs to deal with this stuff. I tried to drink it all away, but in the end it just made me feel worse. I tried tranquilizers, but that did not work. I tried booze and pills together, but still the depression lingered. Now I just smoke cigarettes and go running (what a dichotomy, I know) but whatever works, right?

"The Irony of Loneliness in an Overpopulated World As I spend more time in the presence of depression, I have tried to apply a further focus to understand what is actually going on in my head. Dealing with the sudden appearance of depression has been a nightmare and a half to deal with to say the least. So in response, I regularly attempt to interpret the spiral of self loathing thoughts and whirlwind of emotions that march throughout my mind. My initial reaction to a diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempts has been to run away from everything that reeks of painful memories, both theoretically and literally: * I write this post 7,00 kilometres from my home country, in Japan, where I aim to live for the next couple of years. * I have ghosted those whom I use to call my close friends. * I left all social media in order to avoid contacting people that I knew, and because looking at how happy other people were brought me down. * I changed my image drastically over the past year as an outward expression of the fact that I am trying to change as a person. It is here in Japan that I have come to a terrifying realisation. I cannot run from depression. Here I am, in a country where people speak a totally different language and immersed in a totally different culture to my own, writing a post about depression. Recently, I was walking the streets in search for job opportunities when I sunk into a depressed mood and began thinking about my place in the world (which always turns out well). Nothing actually matters. We work in order to pay rent, in order to stay in the same place, so that we can reliably keep a job so that we can pay rent. It is in this meaninglessness that humans as social beings look to others for comfort. Our lives are but a meaningless speck in an expanding universe. That is quite the depressing thought.. And it is. But why is it that when another body is lying on top of mine, or when I am held in a warm embrace, this thought does not have any impact on me? I have done quite a bit of thinking by myself, and have talked to a bunch of people from back in the psychiatric ward on what 'fixes' us. And the unfortunate answer for most of us is.. Nothing. We cannot be fixed. It is just how our minds work. But what if we do not have to be fixed? The hardest part about depression for me, is the intensity of the loneliness I feel. When I am at my worst, I am so focused on my own loneliness and the meaninglessness of my relationships, that the few connections I do have, I dismiss. Now, this is not the case for all people suffering from depression. For a lot of people, their negative emotions are driven by a sense of worthlessness, meaninglessness or sadness. But the general consensus is, although we cannot 'fix' ourselves, we can have people around us to support us when we are at our lowest. And it makes sense that as social beings, human intimacy provides us with a safety net for when depression is hitting us the hardest. Unfortunately for most of us, the type of physical and emotional intimacy that we strive for is unobtainable. In my life, depression is caused me to push away the people that I have spent time building connections with, and has limited the amount of contact I have had with strangers and people that I COULD connect with. I think it is ironic. It is ironic that in such an overpopulated world, depression is such a big issue. We are the people that need intimacy the most, so you would think we would be in a position where intimacy is more readily available. But that is not how the world works. Our lives are still meaningless. We still hate ourselves. And we are still alone.","The Irony of Loneliness in an Overpopulated World As I spend more time in the presence of depression, I have tried to apply a further focus to understand what is actually going on in my head.

"Why depression is, and is not like a skinned knee: Some thoughts I had that I wanted to share I was just pondering depression, and I decided to jot down what I was thinking. It is sort of a good way to put words to what it feels like to suffer from depression. __ Why it IS like a skinned knee: Depression usually comes in episodes for me, and a lot of people I have talked to. Sometimes I will be doing okay, and then have a really bad day, or even a bad week. These episodes are sort of like skinning your knee. When you were little, skinning your knee feels like the absolute worst thing in the world. You think, ""OW, THIS HURTS SO MUCH! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?!"" You feel so helpless. When you are an adult and skin your knee, you know what to do. You know that you are supposed to clean it, and put a bandage on it. And that is exactly what you do; you do not make a fuss. But, even though you clean it and bandage it, it is of course still going to hurt. It is a cut. You just ignore the pain, though, because you have already taken care of it, and there is not much else you can do beyond that. You just have to live with the fact that it is going to hurt for a while. Depression is the exact same way. When it happens, you know what you should do to handle it. The best way, backed by science and research, is what we have all heard countless times: Exercise, eat healthy, do something nice for yourself, clean your living space, listen to happy music, watch TV shows that make you happy, etc. So you know to do this stuff. But of course, it is not going to magically feel 100% better right off the bat. There is still that emotional pain there, just like the way a skinned knee stings. But you have already done everything you can to take care of it, so you have to live with it and wait patiently for the pain to go away. __ Why depression ISN'T like a skinned knee: Most people know that depression has a way of demotivating sufferers. Things you once enjoyed no longer interest you. Nothing seems like it has a point. But this also affects your drive to treat your depression. When you skin your knee, you just take care of it right away, you do not give any second thought to it. It is just what you do. With depression, you know that you should be exercising, eating healthy, listening to happy music, cleaning, etc. But you do not. What is the point? The difference is, that depression makes you NOT want to get better, or more accurately, not care about getting better. Sometimes, you are just apathetic and nihilistic, ""What is the point? I do not care. Getting better is too much effort."" Sometimes, you just want to wallow in your own despair. For me, when I feel this way, it is because I feel worthless and self-loathing. I think, ""I deserve to feel this way. I deserve this emotional pain that I am going through. I do not deserve to feel better, or to be happy."" That is the vicious cycle that depression uses to keep you down. If you are reading this and have depression, I hope this helps you understand your own illness a little more clearly. If you are reading this and you do not have depression, I hope this gives you a good account of what it is like, so you can empathize with people who have depression. Stay safe, everyone.","Why depression is, and is not like a skinned knee: Some thoughts I had that I wanted to share I was just pondering depression, and I decided to jot down what I was thinking.

"Anyone ever look back at their younger years and wonder how they used to be such a joyful person? I saw a post on here about someone remembering a feeling of emptiness since they were five and just not knowing it was depression. For me it is the opposite. I was always a super joyful kid, and maybe a little too hyper. (I was that annoying kid when I was 10-11). Then around seventh grade I started to withdrawal from the world slightly, and just talked a little less than average. This seemed all fine at the time, it made me a more likable person. But I think that was the beginning. I finally realized my lack of a friend group because of how I acted when I was younger during third quarter that year. It was not bad depression, but it only got worse from there. My Dad turned from mean to abusive starting next year, and my mom started to be disappointed with everything I do. My parents do not even know anything about me besides a few keywords because they have not held a conversation with me since I was 11. The only person who I can say genuinely cares for me is my best friend, and he does not even know I am depressed. I do not see a reason why I am, so why should I explain that to someone who is much more depressed than I am? By the time I turned 14 I can say I was depressed.

"It never ends Some days I just wish I would get hit by a car or never wake up. Today is my birthday and I am turning 22 and I feel like such a loser. I am a moody, anxious, depressed piece of shit and I know my friends and family are sick of me and would be better off without me. I have not accomplished anything with my life, I feel I am stuck in the same place as I was when I was 18. I relapsed and cut myself last month, probably did the most damage to myself then I ever did. I want to die. I want to talk about it with someone but I am scared I will be put into a hospital. And I know how much it would kill my mom if I hurt myself or if I told her I want to die.","I have not accomplished anything with my life, I feel I am stuck in the same place as I was when I was 18."
"isnt it kind of crazy when people who actually are not clinically depressed say they want to die or are depressed for fun, when you are really dealing with those feelings for real? There are people at my work place who clearly are not clinically depressed but tag and share memes like they are lonely or depressed or just say they want to die in a funny way, when everyday is a huge challenge for me in terms of forcing myself to be alive and conform to the societal norms. This usually never gets to me because many people dont actually get what it means to be depressed. Even depressed people experience things in a spectrum. However, when I feel like I am falling off the wagon and I see these seemingly normal treat suicidal thoughts/coping mechanisms of genuinely depressed people/melancholy as fun memes and have a good laugh when all those things are part my own personal hell, I just go completely bonkers and I do not really know why. Anyone else feel like this ? Sorry for terrible punctuation.","isnt it kind of crazy when people who actually are not clinically depressed say they want to die or are depressed for fun, when you are really dealing with those feelings for real?"
"Hello, i am a 24 year old male. this is my 3rd time joining this forum.. i joined once, had to resign in because it moved form .com to .org (or something) then i took medicines, was feeling better and kind of stopped coming here.. now i feel bad again. i think this forum is a great resource.. the people who started it should be quite proud of themselves.. if i started something that touched this many people, at the mindsets that were at.. maybe i would not be depressed anymore. my 1 complaint, as i have mentioned b4.. i think it is wrong to make people post 5 times b4 they are allowed to create a thread.. when people are here, feeling depressed, sometimes, (i would assume) suicidal.. they should be allowed to post new threads right away. However, i do not mean to complain, as i do feel this is a great resource, and it is more then I have done to help the less fortunate in the world.. good luck everyone.","i think it is wrong to make people post 5 times b4 they are allowed to create a thread..

"Falling for someone you have no chance to be with Warning: Super long read Have you ever fallen for someone that you know you have absolutely no chance with? It is been 4 years since I have fallen for a girl back in college, which ended up in heartbreak and depression because she already found someone else. I have lost all motivations and my passion for arts (I am an art student), failed my thesis which sent me into another dark place, 'friends' were not even there to help me get up, and for the remaining years I had in college, the thing that kept me going are my parents, I just wanted to survive for them. I have lost all emotions, the flame that was once burning in my heart, the excitement I had when I was a freshman. I graduated college 7 months ago and found work not related to the course I took up, it felt really low, but I just wanted to survive. Training for work now, did not want to make friends again, had one, but he did not liked the people so he left in a few weeks, the only thing in my mind was to focus and be better for this job to survive. Avoided lunch and hanging out with workmates, and did not really reveal much about myself aside from having a mundane life. The trainers were aware of my introversion and decided to have random sitting arrangements every week so we could get to know our workmates more, and I could get to talk about other stuff aside from work. 3 weeks in training and still, I did not made any connections, I only help out my workmates professionally, point out mistakes and the next step they should take. I get to be sit mates with the liveliest girl in training, playful and have a contagious 'happy' aura(?). There were also a few talks and laughs about work related stuff, but I did not really made efforts to start it, she was always the one that engages first (and that is because she is an extrovert and does this to everyone anyways). Being around her, hearing her voice, seeing her smile felt something, it felt like the flame that I lost 4 years ago came back. But, what made me fell the most is that she is intelligent as well and speaks in English flawlessly (I live in a country outside US). I can also relate to her because she suffers from clinical depression and requires therapy sessions every now and then (everyone in training knows this anyways because she told the class from the get-go). I did not really asked her out for lunch or coffee, I really wanted to so I could get to know her better and be friends with her, be her guide in her darkest days, but my introversion and over thinking always gets the best of me. There were only a few times she joined me and my friend during a coffee break where I found out a few things about her. There were times that I see the sadness beyond her smile, and times where her depression was clearly visible and affected me greatly. I always think about scenarios - if the conditions were right - where I get to talk with her and lend a helping hand, at the end of the day they only remain as thoughts. I know she does not think about me like how I think about her. Every time our shift ends, I leave the office quickly and ignore the feelings I have for her, my mind is at a constant battle on whether or not to ask her for lunch, ask her if she is ok. It is even worse at night, whenever I see her late night tweets about her depression, a part of me just wants to be there for her, and the other part gives me the realization of how pathetic I am and that I do not deserve her. I know that she had an ex-bf that broke her heart, and currently has a gf (she is bi). Yet, she still gives me inspiration in every photo I take. I really do not know what is wrong with me, I am being tormented by my own mind and I still like it. Knowing that she already has someone in her heart, yet still seeing her depressed at times (and looking at her tweets), really makes me want to step up and do something, but held back by my own tormented soul. Next week would be the last week in training, after that we are going to get split up into teams and do actual work, but still go back to class to share our experience and reflect upon them. One could only hope for a miracle that I gain the strength and courage to talk to her more and be a part of her life. I really hate this feeling, yet this pain fuels my passion even more.","I have lost all motivations and my passion for arts (I am an art student), failed my thesis which sent me into another dark place, 'friends' were not even there to help me get up, and for the remaining years I had in college, the thing that kept me going are my parents, I just wanted to survive for them.

"The moment of clarity I have had suicidal ideations for as long as I can remember. Despite this, I always wrote off my depression as not being a problem. Throughout my entire lifetime, my thoughts have been so warped that I just assumed that they are normal parts of the human experience. It sounds so stupid typing things out. The moment I realized that my mental illness was ""real"" was coming to the conclusion that well-adjusted people do not think about killing themselves on a regular basis. And with that, came my wake up call to get help..",The moment of clarity I have had suicidal ideations for as long as I can remember.

"All of my friends annoy me I try to hang out with 'close friends' because I know it is meant to be good for me. There is probably about 4-5 people I am close to. These are all good people who I have known for years, who I can be honest with about my emotions and mental health, who genuinely do care about me. On paper they are amazing. And they are. Only I find that whenever I spend time with a friend, they end up annoying the shit out of me. Each one for a different reason. One talks about herself too much, one is too positive and gushy, one only ever talks about the past, the other only wants to hang out and drink. When I am with them, I just find myself wishing I could be alone. I know the problem is with me, and that I am sabotaging my relationships (as I always do and have done for many years). I feel guilty about it, especially knowing that I am lucky to even have friends. But the truth is, I find people exhausting, and whenever I am with them I just feel lonelier that when I am alone. I end up getting snappy. It is like I am watching myself destroy my relationships but I do not know how to stop. Hanging out with people makes me unhappy.

"What to do with my life. I just turned 21 in June and I am really understanding that life is moving at a very fast pace. I was never good in school only because I hated it and never realized how bad it would effect my future the way it is now. I moved away for college at 19 for a whole year and only passed a few classes because I did not care that much. I came home and decided to take the year off. In that year off I did not grow as a person and I feel empty all I do is sleep and play video games and go out once every two months to hangout. My parents are complaining that I have no girl friend , no life and I am anti social. I am not anti social I just feel so empty and lost that I do not feel like doing anything anymore. I do not even know if I can go back to school because of my grades were and I was lucky enough to get into school. I do not want to move out I just want to go to school and come home as quickly as I can no friends nothing. This lack of growth in the last year has made me thinking to the point. Do I kill myself? What is the point of living if I do not finish school and get a job, why live if I am just gunna work min wage my whole life? Lately I have been asking myself this everyday. What do I do with my life? Is there really a point in living if I do not become a engineer, doctor, lawyer, etc ? All my friends are doing great but I am just at the bottom and I do not understand why they would hangout with a loser like me that is not even at school In my early 20s and I am living at home. I have already missed out of going away for university. I really feel like killing my self is the last option I have because if not I will be homeless because I do not want to hurt my parents anymore with the embarrassment of a child I am and live at home.

Then there are days where I completely fine, but I do not think I have the same fire in me when I was younger.

"Sick of rejection Met someone on an app we seemed to click and talked all night till like 4am, same the next night and the night after that etc. Honestly for the first time in ages I thought Id done it and found someone who liked me aswell and we could hang out and have some fun, even just over the summer Id have been happy with that. After more talking we met, we drove round and spent a few hours just chilling and talking it was fun but something wasnt right. I have these little games I play to kind of notest the waters', nothing creepy just some fun light flirting like a play full punch to the arm or lean myself a bit closer in watching a video or something, harmless stuff but the reactions tell you the story. Long story short it wasnt the story I was hoping for, nothing was reciprocated and there was just no positive body language (I know im sounding like some sort of socially awkward overly analytical weirdo here but trust me its just the best way I can describe it over text). So it gets to nearly 11 he starts yawning talking about being up for work, fair enough weve been out 4 hours so I drop him home, says text me when you get back so I do and sure enough the generic one word 'haha' responses start and that was it. The thing is its not the first time, it happens all the time, I rarely find anyone who actually has proper chat with me (always just 'fuck now dude?' or that type of crap) so I start getting feelings and they seem to like me, we meet and it all seems to fall apart aftwerwards. Your just gonna have to trust me that im not creepy, I dont make sexual advances, I can hold convo, make people laugh, everyone always seems happy to spend a good few hours with me and not want to go home yet when they do it all comes crashing down. Wtf is wrong with me :/","After more talking we met, we drove round and spent a few hours just chilling and talking it was fun but something wasnt right."
"I need to sell/get rid of my gun I am realizing that the only reason I have not killed myself is because my dog loves me.

My friends are having kids and families, and I have my little dog Dixie. She is amazing. I helped rescue her after her owner passed away and I could never do that to her again. She is 11 now and loves me. I read a story online about a dog passing away and I thought ""if little Dixie goes, I will go too."" And it took hours before I realized that I do not think I am kidding. I work only so that bills get paid. I will never pay off my student loan debt. If I go soon, my nephew will not have any memories of me. I am crying on my couch.

"I am in a reflective mood today. I received a phone call this afternoon from the sister of my old neighbor, who I will call Alice. She had passed away this morning. Alice had been fighting terminal colon cancer since March and after harsh chemo therapy and a bout with pneumonia that landed her in the ICU, she decided that enough was enough. She stopped treatment just around the July 4th weekend. I am not too exact on the details, but suffice it to say that she failed quickly after that and passed away in her sleep this morning surrounded by family and friends. She was only 52. As I struggle with Depression, AD/HD, tic disorders, sleep apnea, insomnia, food allergies, pollen allergies, and a weak immunity system I sometimes feel that life is unfair. I used to say that the Universe was out to get me, that God is having his little joke with me. I suppose it is only natural to feel that way. It is a full plate and I am not too hungry for what is on the menu. Then I encounter other people with other hardships and I see that life itself is not fair to an awful lot of people. Life is, in fact, a lousy chef. What struck me as sad today, however, was not simply the passing of somebody I knew. Instead I was struck with my own mortality and weakness. Let me explain. Alice and some other neighbors had not been too kind to me when I moved into the area. They had accused me of various deviant behaviors that to this day still anger me. These were supposed to be my Christian brothers and sisters and instead they wielded stones. The rumors mounted as the months progressed, wilder and wilder, until they reached a crescendo where they became so outlandish that it was easy to disprove them. When all the furor amounted to nothing a lot of people were left with egg on their face. That summer several of the families involved moved away. I have unresolved issues with them, but with Alice, my neighbor, I was able to find forgiveness in my heart. The story did not end happily there with us arm in arm, though. Alice never really apologized to me, though her behavior towards my family and myself became kinder. Unfortunately, she was one of the people I knew who did not believe in AD/HD. One day she told me her opinion on the subject right to my face after I mentioned I had it. I was so stunned by her bold opinion that I stood there slack jawed. I swore that day I would never let that happen to me again. You see a bit of that fire in this blog whenever anybody accuses me of not having a ""real"" problem. I am as fierce in person as well. Thanks to Alice. And now she is passed on. Suddenly my anger feels petty and shallow. She moved away and now has died, but I allowed her to change me. I nursed a wound like an angry coal in my heart. I forgave her for one thing, but held a grudge for another. She became representative of all the doubters in my life and I used that as impetus for change. What type of person does that make me? On top of that, I have set lofty goals for myself that are proving hard to meet. Time is ticking and my 40th birthday is but a scant five months away. One of the byproducts of meeting those goals was to have a book with my name on it that I could bring into her elementary school classroom one day, slam on her desk, and say ""Ha!"" - as if my success would mean anything to her. As if that would prove my struggle with AD/HD was real. How silly. How foolish. Alice was only thirteen years older than I. I can blink and be 52 tomorrow. Mortality laughs at me and replaces all of life is menu items with sour grapes and rotten eggs. What shall I order now? Usually, my sense of humor keeps my spirits alight. Today, however, I see myself as being revealed as a small-minded man with insignificant goals. That even for a moment, no matter how miniscule, I was sad she died before my goals were met.. This both sickens me and splashes me in the face with a brisk dose of reality. December looms and I read news? Time leaks through my fingers and I am worried about a drop in comments on my blog? How did I get so turned around? Where did I get so terribly sidetracked? I need to remember what it is I want out of life. It is not to show up the doubters but to find joy in my own accomplishments. I know that, but negative thought attaches itself to our most noble intentions like a parasite. Allow it to stay too long and it consumes and replaces what was once good and uplifting. I do not resent Alice. I never wished her ill. But I regret I let myself hold a grudge, however slight it seemed. Life is too short for such things. So I will allow Alice to change me again. That way when I order from the menu of life it will not be just desserts.","She had passed away this morning.

"Opened up to a ""friend"" about my depression. It could have gone better. Hello, Reddit. I have never posted here before. I am a bit nervous about sharing this story (I am very shy, even anonymously), so I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read it. I am hoping that just getting it off my chest will help, even if only a little. Also, I am sorry if this post rambles on a bit or is incoherent at all, I am not in the best state of mind at the moment. Earlier today, during our school is lunch break, I opened up to somebody I trusted about my depression and anxiety. I have been on a steep downward spiral recently, and this person had taken notice that something was wrong. She sat me down, grabbed us a couple of sodas, and told me to spill my guts. Normally, I would have simply told her that everything was fine, and made some lame excuse like ""I did not sleep well last night"" or ""I am just worried about my exam scores"". But this was the first time that anybody had ever reached out to try and help, so I decided to be truthful. I thanked her for offering to listen, and explained that I had never shared this with anybody else, so I might struggle to fully express myself. She was understanding, and told me to take as much time as I needed. I was very careful not to unload everything on her, I basically told her exactly what I said at the start of this post: that I struggle with depression and anxiety, and that it is been getting a lot worse recently. Initially, it seemed like it was going well. She had several follow-up questions, some of which I was not entirely comfortable answering. However, for the first time in years I felt a genuine sense of hope, and felt like someone actually cared about me, so I answered them anyway. Eventually, she asked me what was causing all of this. I explained that while there are certainly things that contribute to my depression on a day-to-day basis, at the root of it, there is not really a reason. It is just who I am, almost as if it is hardwired into my brain. It is hard to explain. Do any of you understand what I am talking about? Anyway, this is where things took a turn. While I was trying to explain that, she stopped me and said: ""I am sorry, I cannot do this. I offered to help cause I thought you were just having girl problems, or school problems, or something. I did not realize you were totally emo. We are not in high school anymore. Besides, you are a guy, just toughen up"". That last part stung. I knew that was a common sentiment in our society, but to hear it coming from her, someone I have been friends with since high school, really took me by surprise. I did not know what to say, so I did not say anything. I just kind of looked down at my lap. We sat quietly for a moment, until she got up and started gathering her things. As she started to walk away I said: ""I am sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I was not trying to do that."" She looked back at me and said: ""Look, a big reason I am friends with you is because of your positive attitude. It is infectious, and I love that about you. But if that is really just a mask, then you should probably just keep the mask on if we are going to continue being friends."", and then she left. She texted me a few hours later and said: ""I hope you are able to move past your issues so our friendship can move forward"". I have not responded, and do not plan to. I cry myself to sleep at night enough as it is without also worrying about maintaining a fake personality for her. I probably will not be opening up to anyone like that again anytime soon (except, of course, to all of you wonderful people on the internet). Deep down, I know that most of the people in my life would not react the way she did. But I just do not think I can build up the motivation to try it, not when I struggle just to get up in the morning. I want to thank you all again. Not just for reading my story, but for being a part of this community. Depression and anxiety really suck, and nobody should have to suffer through them alone. ..I am gonna go hug my pillow now.","Opened up to a ""friend"" about my depression.

While I was trying to explain that, she stopped me and said: ""I am sorry, I cannot do this.
As she started to walk away I said: ""I am sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I was not trying to do that."" She looked back at me and said: ""Look, a big reason I am friends with you is because of your positive attitude."
"Whenever I try to change my life these thoughts pop up Had depression and anxiety for years and have many times tried to make changes to my life. But I cannot shake the thought that says: ""why bother?"". ""Why suffer through all that extra pain that change requires just for a long shot chance of a normal life?"". And on top of that I do not even know if I want a normal life! I Often think that the only thing that separates myself from the ""normal people"" (in lack of a better word,) is that the ""normal people"" have an easier time fooling themselves, a bigger capacity for self-delucions. And if happiness can only come from convincing yourself of existential lies, I am not sure if that (happiness) is for me.. Has anyone else struggled with these thoughts? Does anyone know how to motivate yourself to change when it seems so futile?",Whenever I try to change my life these thoughts pop up Had depression and anxiety for years and have many times tried to make changes to my life.
"When people say dont quit SSRIs, listen to them I was put on 20mg Lexapro through my university is health center, but summer rolled around and since I wasnt taking a physical class (online ones dont qualify you for student insurance apparently) I had to pay ~$400 for coverage in the summer in addition to actually paying for my prescriptions. I thought I was in a good enough place (not financially though, obviously) that I didnt even need Lexapro anymore so I started using my remaining bottle and taking smaller doses every day. I went from about 20mg to 5mg a day for a week or two and then I ran out. Fast forward to today (several weeks without) and I feel like i am having a mental breakdown over every single thing, i am a 22 year old man and have broken down crying multiple times in the past 2 weeks and have been getting increasingly angry and even violent in some cases. I was kept waiting too long in a lobby at my apartment for mail and I ended up telling the employees to go fuck themselves and ended up throwing a chair. This is all very interesting considering I got on this and xanax because i couldnt even order food wothout having a nervous breakdown. Another instance is when I stubbed my toe and proceeded to trash my entire fucking apartment and even took a machete to my fridge Dont fucking quit cold turkey. I thought I could handle it but I definitely cant. I just hope this ends soon.

"Been depressed for so long that i cant remember the last time i was myself. Hey guys this is my first post here and i dont know where else to go. Ive been in a dark place for a long time but im the kind of person who channels this into humor so not even my family could tell. I just turned 20 yesterday and ive been depressed for about 2 years now. I havent opened up to anyone about it because i keep brushing it aside thinking it would pass but it just keeps getting worse. Today i realized something that made me genuinely cry, i seriously didnt remember the last time i was myself. I used to be super carefree and relaxed, i was full of energy and would answer any call to chill in seconds. I just asked my close friend when was the last time he remembers the real me and he said it was the beginning of college and im currently finishing my second year. Its been getting progressively worse in the last 6 months with a serious drop in my appetite. I also started feeling anxiety for the first time in my life and suicidal thoughts are uncommon Ive lost about 10 pounds in 2 months because of this. My grades also took a hard hit, going from a 3.0 gpa every semester to a 1.7. I just had a talk with my mom and she told me that im being ungrateful and that i need to get my shit together (ironic considering she suffered depression for years until i pushed her to divorce my father). Im not blaming her at all for my situation because she was raised by two hardasses so i understand why its hard for her to understand why a teen would be depressed. I know that life is worth it and it gets better but i really cant keep the darkness out of my head. Weed has kept me sane for a while but quitting recently caused it to come back full force and i really need advice on how to get back on track. Thanks in advance to whoever takes the time to read this long ass fiesta.","Been depressed for so long that i cant remember the last time i was myself.

"Does anyone else straight up hate themselves? This more than anything reflects onto my own low self-worth, confidence and general view of modern day life. I really struggle seeing the positive in anything. I am well aware this turns people away from me but even so, it is very difficult to break out of. I cannot find the same lust for life that others seem to have. Everything to me basically comes down to: ""Meh, what is the point.""

"I dont understand how people can be so interested in so many things First, let me apologize for formatting issues, I am typing this on mobile. I generally find television boring, have little to no interest in Netflix shows, anime, and most video games and hobbies. I really only have one hobby that I have feel attachment to, and frankly, I dont enjoy most new shows. If I watch something of my own, its typically something I watched from when I was younger, like scooby doo or Phineas and ferb as the two main ones, being my absolute favorites from my youth, though that is rare as it is. And whenever I do those things, except for my one main hobby sometimes, I feel that I am all to aware that it is just escapism, and instead of escaping, I fall back into the same track.

"Does anyone else imagine their depression as being much more wouldramatic' than it actually is? I always think of my depression as being something quite mysterious and I dramatise it in my own mind. It is as if my brain is just trying to make something of depression, which ultimately makes it worse because it gives part of my brain comfort in depression, as it least it gives me some kind of identity. I imagine it as being this huge struggle with myself, almost like a character in a movie or a book and glorify the worst parts of it to provide myself with any comfort I can. It is pretty toxic but it is one of the only ways I can deal with it, does anyone else find themselves doing a similar thing?",Does anyone else imagine their depression as being much more wouldramatic' than it actually is?

I am just really tired. There are people that want me to talk and tell them what is wrong but i cannot because I am scared that they will run. that they will not understand and they just would not care.

"Why is it so hard to just be empathetic? Today, I failed miserably at baking a key lime pie. Filling was way too loose, meringue would not whip, crust cracked, just a terrible time overall. And then my mom comes over and instead of comforting me or something a normal human being would do, says ""Better luck next time,"" with the tone of a carny trying to get a six year old away from his ring toss booth. I got even more upset, and that seemed to genuinely confuse her. All I wanted in that moment was for her to say ""I am sorry your pie did not turn out, it will be okay."" Or just something a human being with emotions would say to their upset daughter. This even just kind of exemplified what I get sick of in people. Even if you do not ""get it"" why is it so hard to realize that people have different priorities from you? Especially people who are depressed or have other mental illnesses. It can be a triumph for us to get out of bed some days. If we share an achievement or (more rarely) a failure with you, be with us in that emotion for a moment. Why is that so hard for ""normal"" people? Oh yeah. Because all the empathetic people are depressed.","All I wanted in that moment was for her to say ""I am sorry your pie did not turn out, it will be okay.""

"How to break up with my depressed/suicidal girlfriend? I am in a tough position.. I fell for a girl over 6 months ago and we have been dating since. It is faded for me at least, and I do not feel the same way I did at all, but from what she is told me her feelings for me have only gotten stronger and we have already hit the I love you stage. I still care for her as a person and there is nothing bad between us nor do we argue, but it is just not what it was and I feel like I have needed to move on for the past 2-3 months. My issue with this is the fact that she is both depressed and has been suicidal in the past (not things I knew off the bat, but learned towards the beginning). She has 1 real friend and a sibling she is close to, but aside from that she does not get along with her family. She is told me before I am really all she has, but not in a desperate way (although I think it is that too). I do not really know how to tell her or what to be cautious of because this is the first time I have dated someone like this. I know it is a shitty situation but I need to move on in a way that leaves her the least impacted or in the best way I can. I have not done anything like cheat on her or hurt her emotionally but I know this will crush her either way..","I still care for her as a person and there is nothing bad between us nor do we argue, but it is just not what it was and I feel like I have needed to move on for the past 2-3 months.

"Doctor taking me off meds Cold Turkey Hi everyone, I have been on Prozac (Fluexetine) since 9th grade. I am a 2nd year student in college now. For the past few years I have been upped from 10mg, to 20mg, and now 40mg. I have been on 40 mg for 3 years. When I went to my doctor it was only to tell him during a check up that I was comfortable with my medicine and dosage, so he would send more prescriptions to my pharmacy. During my last visit, I expected it to be a quick and simple check up as usual, but instead he said he was prescribing me ""3 more months"" of 40 mg Prozac then making me stop cold Turkey because ""being on Prozac for more than 6 months is bad"". I do not understand because he has been constantly renewing my prescription for years and never said anything about tapering off or stopping. I once went a month cold turkey during a health insurance issue and around the 3rd week I had attempted suicide. And addressing the ""3 months"" he promised, I was quickly informed the pharmacy was only given 1 month of medicine for me I have been admitted to a mental hospital by my mother after I got raped and beaten, because I drank a lot of alcohol for a few days. I have been to several therapists. I have been rationing my pills 1 every 2 days, and my mother and fiance who I live with have already seen a drastic change in my behavior. I feel awful because they give me such a nice and comfortable life but I am still depressed. I do not know what to do when I have no more antidepressants after 5+ years and then going cold Turkey. I am afraid my brain chemistry will convince me to do something stupid and damaging to myself again.","During my last visit, I expected it to be a quick and simple check up as usual, but instead he said he was prescribing me ""3 more months"" of 40 mg Prozac then making me stop cold Turkey because ""being on Prozac for more than 6 months is bad"".

And now, I have totally lost the thread of where I was going with this post, thanks to a whole bunch of reasons, and I am getting too stressed to type, and all that is just irritated me further.

"Ok, so i have had depression for at least 4 years and it has gotten a lot worse the past two. My mom tried shoving prozac down my throat and swore that it helped me, but it did not. I did not talk to a counselor until about a month a go. I was going to school and every time i went to main campus i would get Ds and Fs. I would start out ok but then end up sleeping more and more. This past quarter i physically could not get out of bed at one point. My parents just saw it as me blowing my last chance at college and took it as i did not care. It seems like i do not feel anymore. I do care that i blew my last chance at college and i finally decided to see a counselor 3 weeks before the end of the quarter. My parents said the only reason i did that is because i knew i was in trouble and just needed an excuse. I do not know why i do not do the things i know i should be doing. I just feel like i cannot. My parents say it is all my fault, that i do not take responsibility for anything and I just want to blame everything on something else. Which is not the case. They do not think that depression has anything to do with not trying, that it does not affect rational decision making. I am starting to think it does not either. I mean, why cannot i do the things i know I am suppose to do? The things that will better my life. The things that will make my parents proud? Is it the depression or am I truly lazy and just do not care??

How are people so dumb about mental illness? I have people who say yeah, I was depressed before, and I am like what did you do and they say it just went away. Seriously? You just woke up and it was fucking gone? Poof? Everyone always has their golden fix for me too. My mom tells me to drink lemon water. My dad says stop worrying so much. My coworker says meditate.

I definitely think your right that my anxiety has sought out a fear that I dread more than any other and it is true that when I am not feeling depressed ( which incidentally is most of the time. This is only my second spell of depression in 39 years of life) I can mull over these thoughts and not be troubled with them in the slightest. It is really horrible how anxiety can feed off itself and lead you down this path to terrible thoughts.

"Only 7 cigarettes today This sounds really stupid but I have never ever practiced self control with smoking and I usually smoke anywhere from 20 to 30 cigarettes a day.

Cheers EDIT: Jesus, I woke up to my inbox busting at the seams! Thanks for all the advice and kind words. Definitely going to continue the path today. Seems daunting to give up my smokes but cutting down got a lot easier with all of your support. Have a great day folks!","Only 7 cigarettes today This sounds really stupid but I have never ever practiced self control with smoking and I usually smoke anywhere from 20 to 30 cigarettes a day.
I tried for the first time today to cut back and used my iPhone stop watch to try and wait 3 hours before another smoke."
"Have not posted for a while because I have not been feeling too good. I am becoming desperate and do not know what to do anymore. started taking ssri cipralex 2months ago and it has helped a lot with the anxiety and i thought it was helping my depression at first, but I am starting to feel more depressed again. I have gained 2 and a half stone which is depressing in itself, but i would not mind if i did not feel depressed ,i would rather be fat and happy, but I am just fat. I am feeling much more suicidal and worrying constantly what is wrong with me. i feel physically unwell too. Do not know what I am doing wrong. I am taking vitamins and eating protein and carbohydrates and doing everything I am meant to be doing, apart from exercise, do not have the motivation. just so frightened and do not think things will ever get better, just want to end all the pain. am seeing psychiatrist tomorrow and considering stopping the ssri, but have had terrible withdrawal stopping prozac in the past and am afraid. its like I am damned if i do and if i do not. if he suggests switching, then what about more side effects, just cannot cope with this terrible disease anymore, just want to fall asleep and die.","started taking ssri cipralex 2months ago and it has helped a lot with the anxiety and i thought it was helping my depression at first, but I am starting to feel more depressed again.

"I have suffered from depression episodes for about 10 years. Lately, due to major stresses at work, I am back into feeling awful. I am a good employee and have hidden my depression episodes well in the past but now I am terrified that my new boss, whom I hate, will find out and fire me. I am working double time to not be seen as weak and incompetent. I cannot afford to get fired but am terrified that that my boss will use anything to get me fired. The stress of trying to be professional at all times at my job is just about killing me. It makes me so angry. When other employees have physical illness, such as cancer or heart problems my employer rallies around them and makes all sorts of accommodations but I have kept my depression a secret because I am afraid it will be seen as a character flaw and I will be fired. Plus I am so paranoid, I am sure when I come into work each day, I will be escorted off the premises and I do not know what I will do. Any advice from those of you who have been terrified of being discovered.","I am a good employee and have hidden my depression episodes well in the past but now I am terrified that my new boss, whom I hate, will find out and fire me.

"Does anyone else ""live inside their head""? Hi, this is my first ever post. I feel like I am living in my head 99% of the time. I catch myself forming conversations in my head between me and other people. It is pretty obvious because my lips move and I tend to smile when this happens. (A couple of my friends have pointed this out) Sometimes, the conversations are just between me and myself. I feel very numb during this whole process. The topic of these ""conversations"" revolve around feeling worthless in every aspect. It feels like life is against me. I am average in every way (looks, intelligence, skills). I feel like I will never amount to anything. I just do things to get them over with, just so that I can continue to keep to myself and get stuck in my head like this. I do not have pride in any non-school/school project or assignment I do. Even things that should be enjoyable, like going out with friends does not really do anything for me. It feels as if nothing brings me joy, except numbing myself out from everyone else.","I feel like I am living in my head 99% of the time.

"Today is my 21st birthday. I am spending it alone with a bottle of wine. Birthdays have always been a bit of a sore spot for me. To quote a very old comment of mine, ""13th birthday: I had just been let out of a mental hospital a few days before. My mother finds out she has a brain tumor. My only friend at the time gets sick and goes home early. 14th birthday: All my friends but one bail on me. My parents scream at each other until my mother packs up and leaves. 16th birthday: My family and I go out to dinner to a restaurant that my dad chose solely because he had a coupon for it and buys the world is smallest birthday cake. Halfway through my birthday celebration the following weekend my friends abandon me due some drama bullshit that was apparently more important than me. 17th birthday : Dad starts an argument in the middle of a restaurant in front of my best friend. After we get home, the argument continues, resulting in my dad physically attacking my mother. All while my friend and I sat in my bedroom."" To add to that, my friend is mother died of a heart attack on my 18th birthday, and I spent my 20th alone due to the fact that all of my old high school friends had moved on and my best friend had decided to join the military. Well, today was my 21st. My best and only friend completely forgot about me. My dad then made me have an emotional meltdown. Now it is nearly midnight and my only company is the nearly empty bottle of wine sitting next to me, so I am not only sad, but also slightly drunk. Happy birthday to me.","14th birthday: All my friends but one bail on me.

As for life right now, things are looking very positive. K & I are talking and in love again (still?). In fact, this past weekend Husband and I went up to their place and the 4 of us got busy and had a grand time in the bedroom. It was as amazing as the first time, possibly even better.

"this is my first post here. Just wondering if anyone else has this problem. I cannot seem to motivate myself to do something with my life. I am married, no kids, quit school a couple years ago, just working the same job for five years, going nowhere. I am afraid of any kind of change, and I sometimes feel like life is pointless. I get in these ruts where I am stuck in this deep, dark pit of anguish and depression and everything feels completely hopeless. It comes and goes, but these past few weeks have been particularly bad. I was diagnosed several years ago with ocd, which has a lot to do with it, since I work myself into a frenzy of worry, imaging the worst possible scenarios for every situation, and I just shut down and do not want to think about anything, and it is hard to pull myself together and function like a normal human being. Prozac helps, but I do not take it like I should. Just venting a little","I am afraid of any kind of change, and I sometimes feel like life is pointless.

I have been to a doctor before and got medication but I did not want that to be the first solution. I guess I expected my doc to have the answer for me to get better.

"I have been dealing with severe depression for sometime now, and within recent weeks it has hit its worst (most of my posts were in the MNSEN area): lack of sleep, stress, behind on my work, cannot leave my apartment, constant crying, hopeless need, etc. And during these few weeks I have taken the steps into getting into regular therapy again by consulting psych services at my school in conjunction with the counseling I get (or hardly ever get) from my hospital. The severity of my depression has been taking a toll on my friends and last night it seemed to reach its pinnacle. I am not sure what came over me, I was not even drunk, but I started lashing out at a friend of a friend that was at the same party as I was. I started to verbally bully and attack him because he ""annoyed"" me, I do not know why I have so much pent up anger. It rapidly went out of control and before I know it my friends were holding me back and I violently threatened them. For the first time in my life, my best friend (closest friend) had to physically hold me against a wall, almost hitting me, to get me to come down. I just broke down after that, it was not even about that stupid guy anymore. I was suddenly overcome with loneliness and fear an jealousy and embarrassment. I have always been known for a very short temper, and my friends all know me to be very emotional, but I have never gotten so violent; I have hit and thrown objects before in anger and frustration but I have never struck someone. Though they all tried to console me that night, I feel even farther away from the few friends that I do have. Everything was hazy from last night, even though I had hardly any to drink.. it was not so much of an intoxication, but more like a violent breakdown of sorts. I was so angry and I was desperate to physically hurt someone; it was quite a scene since I am a petite girl starting a fight with a passive aggressive 6 ft male--some laughed it off at first as a Napoleon Complex, but it became serious when they saw how out of it I was. I just remember being so hurt and angry at my friends; I felt so alienated which fueled my anger at the world, at my life more.. (As cliche as that sounds). And today I just do not feel like going out and I cannot help but feel so alone. The way my friend violently had to restrain me scared me a lot--I have never seen her like that, and she is certainly not the type to behave like that.. I pushed her to that point. It brought me back to an ex-bf of mine that I was very close too and who saw the worst of my depression as well; he too at one point had to restrain me violently (against his character as well). After an off and on relationship of trying to stay together, he could not take me, or my emotional instability, anymore. Last night, I had friends breaking down screaming at me that they were never enough for me (to make me happy or content otherwise) and it just brought me back to that moment with my ex. I feel as if that this cycle is in all my relationships--romantic ones and friendships. I seem to constantly push people away. I do not know what to do. I do not miss my ex-bf at all, but I am scared that I will never be able to have close relationships/friendships. Everyone I know just pities me. I feel so completely alone and pathetic.","It rapidly went out of control and before I know it my friends were holding me back and I violently threatened them.

"Feeling a lot worse when alone? So I am not sure if I am depressed or not, maybe just too dependent on close ones. But does anyone else actually manage to feel somewhat okay around particular people, only to go back to feeling somewhat numb when alone? I am not sure how to deal with this, but when I am alone I will do shit like binge eat just to feel something. Contrary to when I am not alone, and can actually push myself to go and exercise. The snowball effect is real.. but man do things feel like a struggle for no reason right now, even knowing that it can get better when socializing.

"Can/Should I send her a dm? Hi I will start this with some backstory. A friend of mine plays in a band and last weekend I watched them live for the first time, it was pretty small with four other bands and maybe 15 people watched my friends band. Anyway their lead singer is a girl who gave some weird vibes while on stage, but she was also very edgy so maybe it was that. After the concert someone showed me her IG and I thought I would follow her. She and approved me and followed back. The first post she made after that was pretty much this summarized: I am having a pretty bad phase of depression right now. I have no motivation, cant take compliments serious, hate everything I do and am overwhelmed with the smallest social interactions (there was more but I will stop here). I personally have been struggling for the past few weeks with similar issues again and thought if it was okay to send her a message along the lines of this or if it would be intrusive: Hey I saw your Post about your depression and can relate a lot to yo. I am a friend of guy and saw you live for the first time in city. I know how shit it feels to have phases like this and will not say it becomes magically better, but you are doing an amazing job with your music. I know you do not know me and I do not know you, but if you want to talk to someone who comprehend what you are feeling, I would gladly do it. English is not my first language so some things might sound rough, but I hope I was able to get my message across","A friend of mine plays in a band and last weekend I watched them live for the first time, it was pretty small with four other bands and maybe 15 people watched my friends band.

"Am I Depressed? While I have been distraught and suicidal on and off since age fifteen, I have never been formally diagnosed with anything because I do not trust the mental-health establishment. I have only visited a shrink twice: once when forced by parents, a second time when pressured by a partner. Because of this, I am reluctant to claim I am depressed except in the loose, colloquial sense. Instead, I feel my rage and despair flow quite appropriately from my failure to fulfill my desires, achieve my dreams, and so on. I hate being alive and would adore a sudden death, sure, but that does not necessarily mean I am depressed, right? I do not experience many of the symptoms of formal depression: I sleep pretty well most of the time, I eat okay, and I am socially active. (I feel abjectly isolated, but empirically I spend a fair amount of time with friendly acquaintances at events and so on.) I resist the medical model of my mental state because it assumes the problem is with me rather than with the world. I figure I would be okay if I had the basic level of social success normal folks have: a number of close friends and a healthy romantic/sexual relationship with one or more partners. I am becoming increasingly confident my genetics and values combine to make forming meaningful connections with other humans effectively impossible. Because I yearn for such connections intensely, it is only rational that this dynamic would make my life unlivable. I am not depressed. My brain ai not malfunctioning; it is as valid a pattern as any. The uncaring universe approves of my mind as much as anyone is. I am just not biologically equipped to thrive in the environments I find myself in.","Am I Depressed?

"girl So in the past 2-3 months i been talking to this one girl. I love everything about her and we really clicked together, seeing as we are both socially retarded. Literally everything is been looking up, i started working out, being generally happier and more carefree even in social environments. I am not exactly depressed, just do not really feel much emotion and I do not relate to people around me. Never been a fan of going out and I have had major problems getting to know anyone (I only have 1 very close friend, besides her). I have always had the feeling that I am tolerated but not wanted whenever I am around others, but this chick changed that completely. I actually started to look forward to waking up in the morning and meeting her at uni. On a side note we also like pretty much the same things - similiar music taste, similiar views, similiar feeling of being a reject and ofc vidya games, books and other shit. I knew I was steadily falling in love with her (something I honestly thought impossible before) and just recently I found out she is got a boyfriend. I proceeded to spend the next 2 hours crying like a little bitch for the first time in over a decade. After that I could not even hit any fucking awp shots in cs cause I still had tears streaming from my eyes. My question is, have I reached the point of being pathetic enough that I should call it quits and neck myself?","I love everything about her and we really clicked together, seeing as we are both socially retarded.

"I just drove 100 miles cause my Gma tried to OD and is in ICU. IDK if this belongs here. Maybe it will get removed, but I feel like I need to vent somewhere. My grandma has struggled with manic depression a lot through her life. I have always seen her as this strong independent woman. She has always been my favorite family member because just how kind and loving she is toward everyone and everything. No matter how bad life has ever gotten for me or anyone else she has always had positive words. Well I never knew it but she is a bottler and my dad told me in the 90s she snapped and try to OD roughly 20 years ago. Combination with anxiety and stress and lots of other factors. Keep in mind everyone loves this woman she has 3 granddaughters and 1 grandson and loving kids. This woman is a saint in my family. He we are 20 years later again. My family and I live in Texas, meanwhile they live in Georgia and my dads sister/ gmas daughter and her family live in Virgina. My aunt plans to move back to TX. So my grandparents were planning to move to TX since everyone on the East Coast is leaving. When it came down to sign on a Realtor she snapped I guess again.. These are people in there 70s trying to uproot their life again and move across country. She tried to OD on some pills and my dad, sister, and I hopped in the car yesterday and drove from Tx to Ga. My Gpa said he noticed she was eating less but did not see the signs. Now we surprised her and did not tell her we were coming. Amongst other family all were happy to see us. My Gma I could tell was not the rock solid woman I always known her to be. It made me realize that you can be 70yo and still have these dark thoughts and try. She looked so weak and frail. So here I am in a different time zone trying to support my gma the best I can. My sister does not even know, she just thinks she is isick'. This woman has all the love in the world and that still does not help dark thoughts. IDK how I feel, I do not know how I am coping. It has not hit me yet I think.. Also my Gpa literally would not survive without her. Like she is the one that makes sure bills are paid on time and basically runs the house. She is his guide and he would be lost and a wreck without her. Hes so shaken up and worried. On top of everything my girlfriend just tried the same thing but a different method and her brother called the cops and she got 5150 would and I have talked her once in 3 days. When she called I had just learned about my gma and I feel like she did not get the support she needed from me. It breaks my soul to think that this loving amazing person would want it to go all away and leave all of us behind. I have so many cherished memories of my grandparents.

"Love is what makes the ride worthwhile Without love, why suffer through anything at all? For what gain? I have had love, and I lost love. Love is so powerful a feeling, its a state of being. A person always has within him to very different personalities. That is you without love and you while in love. In love, I am full of goals, ideas, glass half full, my bank account may be low, but it does not effect me. I can deal with anything while in love. I am more confident while in love. I loved to buy her little gifts, make desserts for her, clean the room so she can relax after a long day, shower with her and wash her body, and of course fuck. Out of love.. I am still in love with her, but we can no longer be together. I am scared of the world now. Constantly battling anxious thoughts and worries. I spend my days now trying to stay above water, to not drown in the depression. But no matter how well I swim that day, the pull is still my depressive state. Everyday it is like I am staring into a black abyss that probably goes down infinitely. It is hypnotic and my main goal for the day is to pretend that this gaping exist actually does not exist within me. So that is just what is been on my mind lately. My new normal.","That is you without love and you while in love.

"What do i even do I am just laying here, crying. I have a broken heart. I have voices in my head constantly yelling at me. I cannot get her out of my head. I just want to feel okay and feel loved.

"How can I get my finances back to a point where I can go to school or to a point where I do not hate my life? I guess some backstory. I am 19 about to be 20 in September. When I was in spring of 11th grade my mom got sick (Lupus or something, honestly she might be faking it but that is a whole different post.) Anyway she went to the hospital and was there for about a month. I ended up skipping a lot of school to be able to care for and do all the general house duties for my younger brothers. (11yrs old and 1yr old at the time.). Things progress my mom misses a lot of work we end up moving with my grandma. Now here is where shit really hits the fan. So tensions build between my grandma and my mom because of my moms suspected prescription opiate and Benzo abuse. Anyhow, dfchs gets involved (not related to the drugs but that did not help) about 4 months before I go to college and my moms health deteriorates seemingly out of nowhere. So freshman and sophomore year I am juggling trying to work to support myself, school, and helping my grandma take care of my brothers. I thought I could handle it, I could not. Of course my schoolwork suffered and my gpa dropped below Hope eligibility. So I tried to find a full time job, and I did. Then got laid off not too soon after due to budget cuts. My first time experiencing adulthood. Shortly after my car died and my depression got to a dark place. What followed is 3months of applying to anything I could reasonably walk to (I was trying to search within 5miles) because transportation in the part of Georgia I was in was a huge deal and I could not get around. No jobs responded. Including the Walmart a mile away with a fucking hiring sign out front that I repeatedly went in to try and talk and build rapport with the managers. During these 3 months I took out 3 credit cards and ended up maxing them out. I needed food and other essentials that I simply had no money for. The depression kinda spiraled out of control. I had a plan in place to hang myself but my friends at the time took the rope I was going to use and I was too broke to buy another. My dad who has been in and out of my life. Mostly out prior to this. Invited me out to come stay with him and his family in LA while I tried to get myself together. I am working hard, I found a job here. Retail but it is a job. I am waking up early, I am doing noFap and I am working out 3x a week to try to keep my depression in check. But despite all that, I want to kill die still. I do not see a future where I am able to continue school. Dfchs told me they could not help pay for college because I was not in for long enough before beginning college but they had no fucking problem coming to my dorm and asking me questions and causing stress once a week. I feel like I am barely supporting myself, and honestly I have not talked to my brothers since the youngest ones birthday (April 15th). Because I feel like I failed them. I have not talked to my grandma either because I feel like a disappointment. And my mom keeps calling me every other month telling me she is gonna kill herself because she feels like nobody loves her. Even through I bent over fucking backwards trying to help her by bringing my brothers to see her and making sure they could talk. (My grandma and the rest of my moms family will not talk to her because she is cursed all of them out horribly when they tried to be there for her)","Things progress my mom misses a lot of work we end up moving with my grandma.

Let is get out of chronological order. Due to weird circumstances, I went for about 3 months without medicines, and therapy. In November, I was at the bottom of a deep, dark pit, so called my psychiatrist, Barry. Surprising for me, I went back with a new, improved attitude. We would had a couple of productive sessions when annual reviews came out. I called him for advice, and thought that while the advice he offered was good, that he was not being supportive at all. I actually thought about how to discuss with him how his response made me feel, rather than just shut him out. We had a couple of excellent sessions, which apparently told him that something had triggered defensive coping skills, and where my mind actually was.

"Everything has changed.. About four years ago I was the typical loner. I was in the middle school. Nobody took me seriously, because my hobbies were not shared by anyone else. I am from a small town, so it was difficult for me to find someone who actually liked the things I did. At the time I liked things like anime, video games and MLP. I am a 19 year old lass now and I only like video games now. In the final grade of my middle school I met a girl. She was about two years younger but liked the same things I did. I was so happy to finally meet someone like me. We have bonded a lot and she was the first person I truly loved, except for my family, of course. About two years ago we started to get distant. She kept talking to me about things I was uncomfortable with, but whenever I tried to talk about something that bothered me, she told me she was busy and did not hear me out. It escalated in June of 2016. I started talking to her friends, because they seemed like such wonderful people to me. Then we met up, all of us. She kept crying and making scenes. Few weeks before that, she accused me of liking HER friends more than I liked her. But when we all met, it seemed alright, save for her crying etc.. When I got home the next day, she told me off. Really badly. She told me to go to hell, called me all sorts of names and I feared.. I feared I would never be able to find someone like her again. I tried to end it. Swallowed sleeping pills and drank alcohol. I woke up the next day in a hospital. I woke up to a text from her. One that said she wishes my mother was torn apart by the girl is dogs.. It is been two years. I have gotten better, met friends that helped me out a lot and I will probably never be able to repay it. But this past of mine, it still haunts me. I do not think I will ever be able to trust someone like this again. I have gotten so cynical and careless about everything.. It still hurts.","I am a 19 year old lass now and I only like video games now.

"I am new to these boards and I hope I am posting in the right spot..I have been diagnosed with major recurring depression since 1992. I have a host of chronic, painful auto-immune related diseases. I am also trying to care for an ill family member who just got out of the hospital and had major surgery (takes a year to recover from this surgery). This family member is pretty much bedridden and needs to be bathed, fed, and cared for much the way a private duty nurse would. It is a daunting task for me under the circumstances. Insurance will not pay for long term care and we cannot afford even the cheapest of help. Hence, I am managing all of it alone. Once in a blue moon, my in-laws will help but are very resentful on the rare occasion that I ask for help. My house is cluttered (I saw that topic) and I am not sure if its because I am so depressed or because I have been sick too much to take care of it. I think perhaps its both. I know that at least some of my depression is situational, but I also know that some of it is not. I am on medication, but the medicines have never done a whole lot for me. I have tried them all. I was found to be ""resistant"" to medication. Whatever that means. I was hospitalized for a 3 month period in the 1990 is for suicide attempts. I guess what brought me here is that I feel like I am about to ""crack"" and am trying to find a way to avoid that. I am hoping to get past this pain caused by this disease I have so that I can get the energy back that I need to unclutter my house, have a genuine smile on my face when handling my nursing duties and get a hold on my life in general.","I am also trying to care for an ill family member who just got out of the hospital and had major surgery (takes a year to recover from this surgery).

"Having a really bad stretch of days.. Hi all, I know this sub moves kinda fast but I just wanted to vent, hopefully some of you read this.. So my story is that I have had depression and social anxiety for about 15 years or so (at least that is when I recall starting to feel ""off"".. I am 29 now).. Because of my poor decision to bottle things up and accept that I am unhappy I put off seeking help until about a month or two ago in which I started going to therapy. It had taken a rather bad mental fallout that occurred in early December for me to finally reach out for help. In my sessions we have been working on techniques to combat both my SA and depression, these include going to places alone such as coffee shops, yoga classes, shopping malls, etc. (Keep in mind I have ""functioning"" social anxiety where I can physically be around people but I am extremely uncomfortable the entire time and have a very difficult time interacting with people).. The thought process being that my depression stems from loneliness and my SA contributes to that.. It is been a big step for me to try and go out on my own, but I have been doing it almost every day even though it does not seem to be creating any improvement. Unfortunately the last few days have been incredibly difficult, I am getting a very sick feeling of hopelessness and worry that my life is now just constantly shuffling around desperately trying to find something in the world that will ""fix"" me. I tried to sit at home last night to give myself a break and I could not even do that, I started becoming consumed by those bad thoughts and began having a panic attack.. So I decided to just go drive aimlessly even though we were in the middle of a snow storm.. I feel miserable again today and I am just running out of steam to keep going, I really do not know what to do anymore.. I am exhausted from constantly forcing myself into uncomfortable public situations but at the same time my home feels like a prison.. I have nobody to talk to or gain support from anymore, the couple of friends that I have all have their own lives with wives and kids and my family has been out of my life for 10 years and for good reason.. I know nobody has answers as to what I should do but I just needed to rant","So my story is that I have had depression and social anxiety for about 15 years or so (at least that is when I recall starting to feel ""off""..

By December the side effects were not stopping and I stopped taking them because I always felt sick to my stomach .. and a person cannot work that way. So I stopped them .. I have not been to the doctor since and have been feeling on top of the world.

I do not think I can go back to my doctor .. she will just tell me to take the drugs and stop whining. I am not so sure I am depressed. Maybe I am normal and it is the rest of the world messed up?

"My First Real Episode Hey guys.. I just really need to word soup to get things out that have been on my mind that I have not shared with anyone close to me, I feel as if this is the only way to fight this feeling of sadness. So to start everything off, I never thought that I would be typing these words as I am now. Not to say that I am ashamed of it, but just because I never felt I had anyone to share with. I never have felt like I was able to confide in my close friends or family because I do not want them to carry the burden of my troubles, and I used to feel like it would just be a form of attention seeking to try and explain to others how I feel sometimes. With that being said, I feel as if I truly hit my lowest of lows about an hour ago and the sad thing is that I cannot really describe the feeling.. because all it felt like was just a severe sense of nothingness. I felt as if I was experiencing an out of body sensation, and my mind could not calculate any sense of emotion besides this feeling of dread that was accompanied by a warmth-like feeling starting from the back of my brain and slowly taking over my head. It is been happening a lot lately during the night.. especially since I have been moderately sick lately and it feels like my body is giving up on me no matter what I try.. eating healthy and exercising only takes away the feelings of loneliness and sickness a little bit. What really helps is interaction with others, whether it be watching live programs or being on xbox talking to people or being in chat rooms because it gives me a small sense of community and belonging that I lose when my mind is left alone to itself. I know it sounds stupid, but lately I have just been envisioning my feelings as the mind flayer monster from Stranger Things because it helps me make a little more sense of everything to a degree when I envision the feelings as something physical.. I just wish it was a bit easier to find the focal point/issue that makes me this way to improve not only my life but also the lives of others around me.","I felt as if I was experiencing an out of body sensation, and my mind could not calculate any sense of emotion besides this feeling of dread that was accompanied by a warmth-like feeling starting from the back of my brain and slowly taking over my head.

The only moments of Bliss I get are sometimes with my boyfriend, I get giddy about thinking about our future, or seeing a selfie he sent me while at work and make me swell. Those are occasional, but the only thing I ever feel that is positive to a somewhat major degree. I think my new birth control (first time on it) has made my depression worse. I do not believe in antidepressants for myself. I have been stressed out so much I have lost a bunch of weight too. Now that I have vented, I just do not want to feel alone. I want this to go away. I want to be excited to see my boyfriend at the end of the day, and excited for the day I may marry him. I want to have a hobby I am passionate about. I want to go to work and be happy and thankful I have a job that I do. I want to feel love for my mom and dad. Is anyone else like me out there? Does it ever get better?","I do not feel the own love or care for my family or friends.

"Does anyone else have friends that act like they like you but never text you to hang out or see how you are doing? I do not have a single friend who will text me to hang out. I always have to start the conversation. Every time we hang out though people seem to enjoy my presence. I do not get it why does no one like me, it feels like everyone is just acting nice but secretly hates me. I try and tell my friends to hang out after a rough week and a breakup, and I just got blown off entirely. I am really at a loss because no one gives a shit. Edit: For example I texted a friend of mine i have known since elementary school if he wanted to hang out. He said sure and he would text me later. He never did. I told literally one of my best friends I would been having a rough week and wanted to hang out. He blew me off to hang out with someone else.

"It feels like my friend does not care about me and is rubbing it in my face So the only best friend I had planned out for weeks how she was going to do something behind my back then brag about it to me and make up stuff about what happened to make me jealous. I immediately found out that she was making stuff about it up but that kinda just made it worse. It still bothers me a lot even though it happened in July and it is still making me depressed. I sort of stopped talking to her for a few weeks but then when I felt like I could I refollowed her posts on facebook and nearly every single post is like ""I love my new best friend more than anyone else"" not even exaggerating. I tried to ignore it but there were just constant posts like that I just cannot look at anything she posts anymore because some how it makes me more depressed and lowers my self image even more though it is already at zero.

"Massively depressed and looking for low-cost help Hi there, I am not the type of person to turn to the internet for self-help, but I am at a loss about what to do and I feel like I have nowhere to turn. I am 29 y/o F with a history of depression since age 14. I have been on and off about 3-4 different type of antidepressants and in and out of therapy since initial diagnosis, so neither concept is really foreign to me. I am looking for a low-cost way to talk about my symptoms, even an alternative to real ""talk therapy"". I was in a MSBP-type situation where as a young adult I was forced into therapy when I was not ready, and made to discuss what should have been patient protected information with my family after my sessions, so I am hesitant to ""get into"" that again after the experience.

"Dear reddit, i need your help I have never had a good relationship with my family. I am 15/m and always seen by everyone as overly sensitive and feminine. Kinda makes my life harder. I was recently diagnosed with depression after someone called a sub division of the Canadian child services because I was a suicide risk. Right now I am on vacation in park city, Utah I am the first and only one in my family with any sort if nenral problems. I end up freaking out on the inside and my parents just tell me that this is the best part if my life and u should enjoy it.

It is currently 12:32 and I am in the basement after my brother kicked me out of my own bed. I got about 5 mins of sleep before this happened and the part that really pisses me off about it is the fact that I am an insomniac. It is a miracle I get anything and he just wakes me up. My brother is 10. When he was 8 and 9 he would have tried to drown me multiple times and stab me once. When my diagnosis came around he is been doing everything he can to.push me towards suicide. I go to tell my friends about things that have been said to me and things that I am feeling and their response is always dude u have a gf do not be depressed or just what the fuck is wrong with u.

"Depression and grief I am a 28 yr old M, who has been diagnosed with treatment resistant MDD from the age of 16. Recently, I was attempting to get into a ketamine study in a NYC hospital and was asked a number of questions about my background. One item which came up that I have not thought about in a while was the specifics of my uncles suicide when I was around 13. My uncle was a 28 yr old gay M, developed HIV and killed himself. Though this is not what I was initially told. It took around 10 years with every year or so getting a new piece of information. Initially I was told he had cancer and died. Then I was told he had cancer and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had cancer, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had HIV, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then, finally, I was told he was gay, had HIV and killed himself. I think I secretly had an understanding of how he had killed himself even when I was a kid and was not told due to subtle hints that kids will typically pick up on. Even if I did not, I always had the feeling that something was wrong and that my parents were not truthful. After discussing his death for two hours for the study, I realized that the depression I have been feeling for over 12 years is so similar to the feeling I get when I think of my uncle. Intense grief. I delved into the feeling more and have not been able to stop crying for the past few days about my uncle. Does this make sense from a psychological stand point to be greiving for this long? I know there is no time limit on emotions but does it make sense for my depression to be as a result of shoving down his death and holding onto it for all this time? I would love to hear some thoughts and opinions. I dont know exactly what I am looking for by posting this but I have really been struggling with the emotions I have been having and would appreciate some guidance and if not, some affirmation.","My uncle was a 28 yr old gay M, developed HIV and killed himself.

"I made it so much worse Hey guys, have not been on reddit long, or this subreddit either. Never intended to post something, but recent events have changed that. So, I will start with some background, I am a 17 year old high school student. My best friend is 17 too, (Who will be referred to as Golf from now on) We did not even know each other before the school year started, but we had a couple mutual friends and we just.. connected. It is one of those friendships where it does not really make sense, to anyone, let alone either of us, it is like we are family. It is the only way I can describe it. Anyway, we are dipshit high schoolers, so we joke about depression and suicide in our friend group. The group knows Golf has depression, they have no clue about mine though. Anyway, when I started hanging out with him I did what I have been doing for a year and a half. Joking about my depression and making jokes about offing myself. I did not know Golf had it until a couple months ago, but soon after we started hanging out he started joking about it too. Well he got reported to the counseling center, a couple of times in fact. But they are honestly useless, so it did not help. It came to a head last night when the group basically kidnapped him and forced him to go to a hospital. They did not tell me for whatever reason. I still have not figured out why. But eventually I got there. The night is a blur from there, I did not eat anything since breakfast, and that was noodles. As I am just now typing this I realize that I am at around 30 hours without food now. But that is not important. I did my best to be there for Golf. He went home safe with his parents and is going to go to therapy/counseling. It was an awful day yesterday, a couple of events made Golf is depression way worse for him. I am glad we got him to the hospital before he hurt himself. But it is my fault, I know it is. I do not need you guys telling me how it is not either. You wont change my mind. It is my fault, I taught him that suicide and depression could be treated as a joke. I made it worse. I hate myself for it. I do not know what to do. Hell, I do not know why I made this post at all. I do not know if I want advice, or vent, or see if there is someone else out there who has gone through something like this. Right now he is on a trip with his mom and dad golfing. Golf (the activity) is one of the few things he enjoys. All I want to do is lay in my bed and not exist in the outside world for the rest of spring break.

I am talking booze and watching horrible telivision from the 80 is And it dawns on me that I will get another chance. I may have fucked things up this time but I have bounced back from fuckups before by just acting natural so I am probably going to do so again.

So what is my situation now? Jobless, girls still despise me, have a degree with which I cannot find a job with and all the work I put into improving my situation was for nothing. While trying to improvie myself and during my studies and time at the Army I still had periods where I felt very down. It just becomes harder and harder and harder to crawl out of it every time. The negative voices and feelings are too much and getting up to fight just becomes impossible. I had the power once to get up and try to fight. Now I do not even have the power to suicide. But I just wish it was all over. Eventhough it feels useless I might go to a psychologist. How has it helped you guys? I wa not to end it all but I do not want to end it all. I do not know. I feel lost and sinking deeper every damn time.","It is hard to keep standing up, keep fighting, and get down each time.
I finished my studies (not by working hard, but because I was good at it) and put all negative emotions into working out.

Have no life I feel like as if I have no life besides the fantasies I have created in my head. I picture myself in a couple years as this perfect happy person with a booming social life and a good job. I create scenarios where everything is just perfect and everybody loves me.

"How do I deal with feeling worthless? I have had a bad day and this is on top of just a long few years of my life where I cannot remember the last time I have truly been happy. I have a few friends but the more my life has gone on, the more I have realized certain dislikings i have towards them. I want to meet new people and do new things, something that my friends are not interested in or do not have time for. I am as bad as you could imagine when it comes to making new friends because I can be really socially awkward and I am convinced that few other people share specific interests that I would look for in friends or a girlfriend. I have few (if any) aspirations in life and I just feel like I am drifting through life without any idea what I want. I do not feel like I have accomplished much in my life, I am in college but I have never held a job before and I am hardly passionate enough about a career to really be interested to want to pursue it. Maybe this sounds like a really pathetic post but I honestly do not know what to do.

"college- medical withdrawal for a semester Okay, so I am thinking about either doing a course load reduction or a medical withdrawal due to my anxiety and depression. I have already contacted my academic advisor and the financial aid office, but I honestly have no idea whether everything will work out or not. If I manage to get a course load reduction, does anyone have any ideas for things I can do to help myself get better during this semester? If it ends up not working out, does anyone know about other ways I can go about making this semester less stressful? For background, I have a scholarship for tuition for the next two years and I am terrified as fuck that I will lose that if I get a course load reduction. Also, my parents basically do not know what mental health is so there is no way I can talk to them about it.","If I manage to get a course load reduction, does anyone have any ideas for things I can do to help myself get better during this semester?"

"Women ignore me, even here, they think I am unworthy or too ugly to be helped. I even have the stats to prove it. Why am I so undeserving of love? I made a post yesterday today asking for help as to why I am undatable and why no women wants to go out with me. I got 450+ views and only 6 comments, only 1 of which was from a woman. Everyone else was a male who either tried to give some advice or made fun of me. Here is proof: So if 250 women viewed my profile, only one person tried to say something. Everyone else ignored me. 1/250. 249/250 women think I am ugly or not worthy of a relationship. Think about that. That is how unwanted I am. What if every 3 minutes, someone told you ""you are ugly, no one wants you, no one cares for you, and you will die forever alone""? That is the life I might as well live in. Let is not also forget the people that made fun of me too. I mean, what do you want me to do to get your replies, ladies? Do you want me to give you gold? Will that incentivize you to reply? The sidebar says ""A supportive space for anyone struggling with depression."" and yet people make fun of me, do not want to help, and call me ugly. I guess I am that hopeless. Am I really a human anymore? It is human to fall in love and get into relationships and have sex and whatnot with your SO. It is human to even hookup with people. I am not qualified to be a human apparently. I bet most people my age have had 3-4 SOs, and I have had a big fat 0. Even other people with anxiety and depression can get into relationships, when other people see them, their mental illness makes them want to care for them, but for me, they run away.

"Reddit Secret Santa Saved My Life.. I want to begin this by saying that I have been in a really dark place recently. Combination of family issues, breakup, and finals put me in a really depressive state. As a result, I would been having strong suicidal thoughts for weeks. I had been seriously thinking about ending my own life. So that is the context in which this occurs. About a month ago I signed up for secret santa on a whim. I had never done it before and honestly did not expect anything. But yesterday, my gift arrived. I do not know who this person is, but they spent at least $150 dollars on about 6 separate gifts. They also included a really thoughtful and touching letter that talked about how they thought I was such a great person and how much they enjoyed learning about me. I immediately broke down crying upon reading it. It might seem small or sorta stupid, but it made me feel like someone cared about me. That I was not the idiotic nobody my depression tells me I am all of the time. I felt motivated and happy for the first time in weeks. I cleaned my room and did work that I would been ignoring for months. I finally felt like maybe, just maybe, I meant something. It changed my life, and probably saved it. So whoever you are, thank you so much, and I cannot express how much this meant to me or thank you enough. And let this be a lesson to everyone else. The smallest act can and does make a difference. Let is all try and use the Christmas season to ensure everyone feels a little more loved.","Reddit Secret Santa Saved My Life..

"[Need Advice] Need anti depressants but I do not want my mum to know about it. Hello guys, I am 17 and I live in Singapore with my Mum. I have been depressed on and off for the past 5 years with serious suicidal thoughts for the last 4. I really think that it is time that I start anti depressants because I reckon it would help me tons. The problem is, I do not want my mum to know because the last time I opened up about being slightly suicidal and very depressed, she freaked out on me (do not need to get into details.) She has had a history with it herself and I know that if i ever took my life, it would permanently ruin her. At this point, medication is my last resort. I have had a girlfriend and it made no difference whatsoever, I still feel empty most of the time and would rather die than anything else. I know that in Singapore you are able to consent medically when you are 16, but I am not sure if i can possible get around her for meds like this without her knowledge/consent.

"Desperately want to WANT TO get better Attempted suicide May 1st, wasted a week of my life in voluntary inpatient, was put on the one drug that has ever helped me (olanzapine, an antipsychotic) which I then promptly had an allergic reaction to, got off of, and crashed again. Was able to drag myself through some intensive outpatient group therapy for a while and then quit that too. The only good thing I have left in my life is my fianc. I know it is not healthy to live for another person but I am not exactly in a position to nitpick. At this point all I can do for them is try to be as reliable as possible while also isolating myself more often than not so that they do not have to deal with a constantly suicidal person more frequently than they can handle. But I want more? I want to be able to grow with them and be an active part of a life they enjoy? I want to repay them for all the things they do in vain to try to make me happy?

"The toughest pill to swallow is that I care about the girl most I have lost all motivation for my academic life, have basically no ambition left and have just been floating around doing nothing the past few years.

I was one of the early pioneers and had literally a couple hundred thousand dollars worth not too long ago. I will admit this one was getting to me quite a bit.

"I think I ruined another friendship TLR: Made a wonderful friend, had a depressive episode, and ruined the friendship by trying to force my problems on her. Just like I have done a million time before. I have had depression my whole life and I have always gone through episodes. Sometimes they are mild, and I am just generally down for a few days, sometimes they debilitating and I can barely get out of bed for weeks. I have also never had a lot of friends. I do not have casual relationships. I either do not really think of you a friend, or I love you with every part of my heart. There is no middle ground. I have been building a friendship with a great girl from work (call her Amy) for a few months. It does not seem like anything romantic is gonna come from it, but it was nice to have a friend I could do stuff with. We went hiking, rock climbing, we even went on a scuba trip to the Caribbean together. I would opened up to her about my depression and she seemed really understanding. She actually seemed to appreciate how open and communicative I was about it. The day before the Super Bowl, I felt an episode coming on. It was not severe, but it made me fragile. I am a big Patriots fan, so when the Pats lost, it set me up for a bad episode. If I would just been sad about the Patriots Monday and let myself heal like I usually do when my teams lose, everything would have been fine, but instead I started to blow my friendship. I texted Amy Tuesday that I was feeling down and I would like to see her. I made a big deal about how I was not crying about the Pats, but I was having an episode. It seemed important to me to point that out for some reason. She said someone was visiting from our India office and had a ton of work for her, but she would try to come over after. She worked until 930 that night and never made it. Wednesday I left work at 10am because I was too down to stay. I was texting her the same stuff throughout the day, how I was sad and I wanted to see her. She worked until 930 again and did not come, but this time she had never promised to. I texted her this big apology about how I have been a shitty friend and I am sorry for forcing my problems on her. At work Thursday she told me to stop apologizing for everything. I told her I would try to stop. Friday just felt different. She was less talkative with me than usual. She brought me cookies she made, and I thought that might be a sign that things were getting better, but after work I asked her if she had plans that weekend, and her answer was simply ""yes"". I said have fun and left. Normally she would have at least told me she a general idea of what she was doing. I talked to my roommate/best friend (Samantha) about it Friday night. We agreed I needed to just leave Amy alone for the weekend, so I texted her and said if she found any free time I would love to see her and then I did not contact her again until yesterday at work. Yesterday some things happened that really made me feel like things were ending. First, we had talked about planning a trip President is day weekend, but she had a surgery and she did not want to plan anything until it was done (that is a whole other thing that is bothering me). When I asked her yesterday, she said she thought President is day was in March and she promised to see her brother this weekend, so ""we will see"". She also told me she likes working late and going to the gym at like 930. Apparently she is been working 12 hour days for the past week. The gym part hurt because one of my favorite things to do with her was work out, and now I have lost my gym buddy. I have had a lot of friendships go this way in the past. Speaking a little immodestly here, but when I am not depressed, I am funny, energetic, and interesting, and generally a fun person to be around. I have had lots of people enter my life, meet that me, like him, then after a few months meet the depressed side of me and just nope the fuck out. Amy first met the depressed me a few months ago and she did not run away. I thought she could be a big part of my support network moving forward. But I am worried that I just tried to put too much on her. Like I have done a million times before. The worst part is she sits right next to me at work. She is leaving next month to hike the Appalachian Trail, but until then, if I really did blow this, then I have to sit next to her every day for a month. I do not know if I can handle that. Anyway, thanks for listening to me whine about my problems.","I think I ruined another friendship TLR: Made a wonderful friend, had a depressive episode, and ruined the friendship by trying to force my problems on her.

I have been prescribed 40mg of paroxetine, but stopped taking it a couple of months ago as it was not helping me in my situation, which has probably made me physically worse. My depression probably stems from low self esteem and the feeling of general failure. I have suffered for 19 years now, not constantly, as ""success"" at work can suppress it (i.e. times when I feel I am contributing something).

"Here is my story, however dull and blunt it may be .. High school was great. Lots of fun You know- Parties, beer, dates, sports and the works. I was never what one would call popular, however, I was respected by nearly everyone I went to school with. This, I feel was an asset of mine and helped me with self confidence as well as developing as a individual. I am now 19 (20 in June) and have no job, no money, do not go to school and have LITERALLY no friends, aside from my parents whom I still live with a leach off of (what a joke). I am virtually reclusive in my home with the occasional outing to buy cigarettes and to visit my Grandmother who is well near her deathbed. I suppose my past bout with drugs may be a co - culprit influencing me to work in 'close to' complete isolation. Maybe there is a cure for me but, chances are it is not natural remedy. My addictive personality and past drug experiences has veered me away from trying the latest depression medications or any for that matter. This condition of mine, whatever the fuck it is, started developing slowly. I would avoid large social gatherings at first, then I would pretty much steer clear of meeting with friends (even the closest of friends), and finally I would not even take phone calls. At this point it is all of the above. When I do confront a person, which by all means I try to avoid, I cannot for the life of me keep eye contact like I used to and I seem like a complete, uninterested asshole who is simply in a rush and has no time for chat. For instance, a two old friends of mine from high school stopped by at my house today to catch up on things. When asked what I was up to I looked at the ground and replied, ""Well .. I am [pathetic excuse of a lie goes here] .."" Nobody buys my shit. If I do not believe myself how can anyone else.? So, here I am today. The table has turned. I am now the chump. The one without any respect OR self respect and the guy who respects anyone who is not as lowly as myself. And I hate myself for it. It is not as if I had a rough upbringing. My parents are and were loving, I have had so many friends, all the opportunities in the world. And I waste it all and continue to do so every stinking day of my life. I am not looking for sympathy. It actually matters little if nobody reads this at all. I just needed to put my thoughts somewhere I could come back to re - read and contemplate them","I was never what one would call popular, however, I was respected by nearly everyone I went to school with.
I am now 19 (20 in June) and have no job, no money, do not go to school and have LITERALLY no friends, aside from my parents whom I still live with a leach off of (what a joke).
My addictive personality and past drug experiences has veered me away from trying the latest depression medications or any for that matter.
When I do confront a person, which by all means I try to avoid, I cannot for the life of me keep eye contact like I used to and I seem like a complete, uninterested asshole who is simply in a rush and has no time for chat.
For instance, a two old friends of mine from high school stopped by at my house today to catch up on things."
"Maybe I see the world for what it really is Maybe ""healthy"" people are the sick ones for being in denial. It would explain post natal depression. It is one of the worst times of your life, horrible things happen, it is gross. But people tell you you are meant to be happy. How could you be with a screaming baby and no sleep?","Maybe I see the world for what it really is Maybe ""healthy"" people are the sick ones for being in denial."

"Do you feel like a burden to other people? I do. I am 18. When people make me feel bad about myself or control me in a way I do not like or just get annoyed with me just talking to them I tend to feel really depressed, sad and think of how I wish I was not born. I already stuggle to keep and make friends. It hurts me a lot. Makes me sad. It kills me mentally. People just hurt me so much. I do not think I can cope anymore honestly..","When people make me feel bad about myself or control me in a way I do not like or just get annoyed with me just talking to them I tend to feel really depressed, sad and think of how I wish I was not born."
"Drank too much and ended up in the hospital Let me start this off by saying I am underage, so that just makes this just so much better. Anyway, a handful of months back I had the smart idea to get drunk by myself. I do not know what did it, I only drank a few shots, less than what I normally do, but whatever I guess it was destined. Next thing I know, I am waking up all wrapped up in IVs with my mom next to me. I am confused as all living hell. My mom just says you drank the vodka, looking more devastated than I have ever seen her, and then I cry myself to sleep. Now I am ruined. I am broken. The guilt eats away at me all the time, constantly. As soon as I think of my family that is all I can think of. Apparently I was found in a aggravated state, and upon being discovered I punched two holes in the wall, along with attempting to put in a hole in my father is head. God I fucking hate myself. I am not even a violent person, I hate hurting anything. Being anywhere around my home or family just makes me unbearably sad now. I had to come home and look my brother in the eye, and apologize for being so fucked up I tried to not only punch my dad, but a police officer who was forced to restrain me. By the way I do not remember any of this, all of this my parents told me. You know how much that hurts? Not remembering a night at all, and it turns out you ran at your dad screaming, fuck you I am gonna kill you I hate myself. I am so full of regret and guilt and self hatred all the time. I hurt my family so much, and I continue to. I have had multiple emotional breakdowns since, when pretending to be okay just becomes too much. I have made my parents so concerned for me. Not only do they constantly think I am high now, and do not hesitate to think every single fucking broken thing is my fault because I got too fucked up, but with the emotional rants I have had I am sure they think im about to blow any second and kill myself. I ruined everything. My relationship with my family is ruined. I love my parents beyond belief, and I know they love me too, but the shame, and the sadness I feel just being around them, it is constantly unbearable. Nothing feels normal anymore. It has not since that fucking day. I would give anything, literally anything to go back. I would rather be completely paralyzed than do what I did to my family. I have no care for myself at all anymore. I hate myself more than any other person. I am selfish, impulsive, lazy, stupid, and above all less than worthless. If I was not born I am sure my family would be much more happy. I cannot kill myself, because then I would kill my whole family. My mom straight up told me if I kill myself that will be the end for her too. I do not know what to do then. I guess slowly shrivel away or hope I get ran over.","You know how much that hurts?

"I am trying to get communication back with my best friend. I have an idea, it will not be easy and it may never work, but it is worth a shot? Long story short: I have been depressed and I have a friend. I could make a 5 paragraph story about my friend and my depression. But I want to get to the point. I do not want to make this post too long otherwise no one will read it. My friend made the decision to stop communication with me until I go to a residential psychiatric program or somewhere similar. The thing is I have been in one already, it was a pretty flexible place, cell phones were allowed, doors were never locked, etc. Long story short I became too high risk and am not allowed back. And I do not want to go back. I do not believe in happiness by mental health, I believe in natural happiness. I believe that all humans deserve to feel happy without being told your life sucks so you need pills and mental health treatment to be happy. So anyways, I cannot fulfill his wish. But getting communication back with him is all I want. There are no exceptions. So here is my idea. Just for fun I livestream games on YouTube. I do it for fun, not for fame, I do not play those popular games, I play the ones that no one plays. It is unlikely for a video to get more than 100 views. But I have considered starting a new channel. I will livestream games, post videos about my custom Guitar Hero songs (I do that for fun too) and just pretty much show that I am having fun. But the big goal of the channel will be to get my friend back. That will be the whole idea. That will be written on every video. That is what the channel art will say. Think of it as a gofundme, only I am not asking for money, I am asking for support from the public to hear my story, hear what I am doing, and to be there with me when my friend does deliver. Here is the catch. For obvious reasons, his name will never be revealed. No one will have any idea who my friend is. But little by little, I will try to reveal the channel to him. It will start with the channel being named Ian, then sooner or later add my last name. As time goes on I will try and find ways to give him clues about the channel without actually telling him anything. The big dream is that he eventually discovers the channel, and with whatever support there is, he will see how much I have mentally improved over however long it takes. This all may sound totally silly, totally bogus, yeah, maybe this will never work in a million years. Just a wild thought that I am going to attempt anyways. I might edit this post with a link to the channel depending on the response here.","I am trying to get communication back with my best friend.

"Hi My name is Tracy, I am 44 years old and have three children 4,8 and 11, I have been going through something lately I wake up in the morning and its like I am in a different world. I cry about everything. I look at pictures of my kids when they were younger and I burst into tears. I have nothing to be depressed about , good wife, good kids ,good job, I do not understand what is going on. This is totally out of my character. Now it is getting to the point to where I do not want to go to work on night shifts because I am afraid something will happen to them while I am at work. Also when I have to sleep during the day I have trouble falling to sleep Its like I am scared to sleep. I have also wake up from a deep sleep with panic attacks, I have learned how to talk myself out of them. Everything is so emotional it is like I am morning the death of one of my children. Any way its driving me and my wife crazy, Its not all the time it comes and goes, other times I am fine. My wife says I am so much more loving toward my family when I am going through this. I am on zoloft per family doctor. But it do not seem to help. I also have sleep apnea which I read can cause depression. Well if anybody Knows what I am going through please respond, I do not know if its depression or some kind of sleep problem. Thanks for listening","I have nothing to be depressed about , good wife, good kids ,good job, I do not understand what is going on.

"A letter to a person I let down To The Person I Miss The Most, Happy birthday man, I miss you and I am sorry. It feels like so much time has gone by that any attempt at reconciliation would do more harm than anything else at this point. We used to have so much fun, but nostalgia only makes everyone feel worse, and more often than not leads to poor choices. It is a sweet substance, like sugar, just with a punch in the gut to remind you that you cannot ever go back to something you once valued so highly. It is been a year and a couple months since we have talked, and there is rarely a day where you do not cross my mind. I am not saying that is healthy, because it sure as hell is not, but who cares anyways. I was not good for you, you were too good for me, we crashed and burned and I loved every second of it. Was it worth it? Maybe. Does that matter? Not in the slightest. Now I just sit alone in the dark writing you letters that I know you will never fuckin' read, pretending in my head that there is some fucking way that i can salvage the situation. It is like watching someone stand at the bottom of the pool drowning, when all they have to do is swim to the surface. I am cold, and tired, wasting time and throwing away opportunities left and right because i have no idea what I am doing, and I know that you are doing well, that makes me happy. You deserve to succeed. You have been to hell and back, and I might as well have been the chauffeur for a good portion of it. I loved you, I do not think I do anymore, but I know I did. I thought about comparing how I felt about you with a bunch of shitty metaphors but let is be honest, that is not our style. We would probably laugh at how cheesy it was and how stupid this whole situation is and then we would pull out our guitars and write a beautiful sad duet and I would be out of tune while you hit every note perfectly. But you would not critique me, that is just the way you are. Too kind, and sweet, too good to everyone you came across even though you knew there was a pretty good chance that they would never return the favor. And man I really tried to, all those times we walked around talking about how much we wanted to die and how sad we were, but the whole thing was build on the back of our own loneliness and sadness. But that is the past. Nostalgia is bullshit, but I have to indulge once in awhile just to feel something, I am sure you remember that. Here is to better times ahead, and a letter left unread. Sincerely, Your Old Best Friend","It feels like so much time has gone by that any attempt at reconciliation would do more harm than anything else at this point.

"I did not expect there are people here so quick to judge and assume I made a post about how hard it is to date and find someone if you have depression. I mentioned how people with depression who have a significant other most likely have an easier time that those who do not. What I did not imply was that I wanted that just for the sake of ""curing"" my depression. And that is what another member tried to pin on me. He or she quickly went into offensive and started preaching about how selfish it is to want to be in a relationship if you are depressed, how I should go seek therapy and that I should realize that relationships are not a magic cure. I do not want to be in a relationship for it to fix my depression, I am going to therapy, taking antidepressants for 6 years now and I am fully aware being with someone is not a cure ( I was with someone while depressed for 2 years ). I wanted to reply to this person to explain they misunderstood me, but I was too upset, so I deleted the post. Perhaps my wording was not good enough, but still, such a judgemental approach to answering someone is post on a depression subreddit is in my opinion very saddening. Just wanted to share this now, take it as you will.","He or she quickly went into offensive and started preaching about how selfish it is to want to be in a relationship if you are depressed, how I should go seek therapy and that I should realize that relationships are not a magic cure."
"I am screaming inside. I want to cry. My eyes are burning, ready to cry. At least it is something.. A feeling. It has taken me so much time to work up the courage to call a psychiatrist. I told myself no matter how I am feeling I am going to call. I researched and found who is supposed to be the best. I called and was referred to a local chapter; not taking new patients. They referred me to a place where the psychiatrist is not taking new patients but the psychologists are. They asked me what kind of treatment I needed!!

"Intense feelings of not wanting to exist/ wanting to escape and be alone somewhere forever I am a first year in university and have suffered from depression since middle school. I have been able to manage my depression by having really supportive friends and through that, felt like I had a purpose in life. However now entering university, I feel like I have no purpose, no reason to exist and it is a lot harder managing my depression. I fill up my time with work and sports and stuff as a way to distract myself, but I just feel like I am going through the motions of life and everything just feels hallow. I think dying is such a pleasant and peaceful idea and am totally okay with it. I feel like I do not have any actual friends even though I go out a lot, and I feel like I have no impact on other people is lives, like they can go on so easily without me being there. On top of that, I feel like I do not belong anywhere since leaving highschool. I feel like I do not have a place in college, even though I got into my first choice school. However, I am too afraid to drop out because that lifestyle seems even more daunting. I really want to go someplace where I can live out my life in seclusion and just get away from anything. This is mostly just a flood of thoughts that are always in my head, but I just wanted to give my two cents to see if anyone relates to these thoughts/feelings","However now entering university, I feel like I have no purpose, no reason to exist and it is a lot harder managing my depression.

But I still do not feel too inclined to reach out to other people or hang out with them. I do not feel like dealing with people is criticisms or judgements of me.

I was suprised to find out we had quite a bit in common and I felt so giddy every time I talked to her. I decided today I would suprise her with an early Valentine is Day gift and maybe she would like it. Nothing huge, I got her favorite snack and a brief note telling her how I felt. I do not know what I was expecting but she read it the note and walked away with the gift. She texted me a few minutes later she was nervous to reject me because she knew I was afraid and she would like to stay friends. I cannot blame her for how she feels, it is her choice. Although, I feel utterly defeated. I have never been on a date or been kissed, or in any relationship with someone. I thought maybe this would be it, but I was wrong.

I do not feel any better but it is a relief just knowing that you are doing something other than trying to ignore a definite but unexplainable problem. I suffer from severe anxiety, fall asleep fine but wake up at 2.00 am with my mind racing a million miles a minute, mostly about work. This anxiety and depression has definitely affected my relationship with my wife & kids. Most times when you are at work you want to be home & vice versa, really do not know what you want. I do not feel like talking to anyone & have cut off most of my good friends. I understand most men do not want to admit they have a problem until their wife leaves them and it is too late. I am happy that is not the case with me. I just hope the medication kicks in soon so I can see what it feels like to be normal if that is possible.

"My weight is ballooning out of control. I take daily: 40 MG of Prozac (in the morning); 1 MG Klonopin (same time): 1 MG Klonopin (5 PM) 1 MG Klonopin (bedtime), prescribed by a psychiatrist. I also take 100 MG Keppra at bedtime for migraine prevention (prescribed by a neurologist). I have been on various combinations of these for a couple of years. The psychiatrist is doggedly insistent that the medications I am on should not be making me gain weight - but nonetheless they are. I have had other medications that have given me side effects that I ""should not"" have had - but nonetheless I do. I have read many, many stories on the internet and through direct conversation with others that say they have had exactly the same things happen with SSRI is. When I have asked him to change the medication, he keeps preaching ""diet and exercise"". It has not worked. I am now down to the point where I eat virtually nothing and today I exercised to the point where I nearly blacked out. This is causing problems between my wife and I (she also sees the same psychiatrist and takes Klonopin and Effexor), not least because I have no sexual desire. None. She sees him (the psychiatrist) tomorrow but I do not see him until April 6. Yesterday in my therapy session I had an angry outburst that maybe I should just quit taking all the medication (because maybe I am over medicated) and she did not like that too much. Am I going to have to die of obesity or over exercise to get his attention? What do I have to do to convince them?

"Nightmares and dreams HI, I do not know about you, but when I was a kid I used to have this weird nightmares (not the teeth fell out usual nightmares) Like getting lost in a winter forest in pijamas just to be eaten up by wolves, being totally awake at my bed while insects ate me alive ( like sleep paralysis but dreaming?) or just watching my mother being eaten by feral dogs as she protected me. Anyway, as I grew older and my depression grew with me, I stopped having nightmares, I can barely recall when the last one was. Instead I have pretty vivid dreams (not lucid ones) and in most of them, I am at some kind of weird scenery where I feel like I have always been there, and weird shit happens that I can remember, and it is like a full story, a lot of different things happen in the same dream. The problem is, in most of them, I meet someone, normally a girl, with which I start a mutual relationship after overcoming some hardship, like, my biggest desire. These dreams, as good as they sound, are worst than the nightmares because when I wake up, it takes some time to realize that I did not live that shit, that I am still in bed, and I am still alone.","Nightmares and dreams HI, I do not know about you, but when I was a kid I used to have this weird nightmares (not the teeth fell out usual nightmares) Like getting lost in a winter forest in pijamas just to be eaten up by wolves, being totally awake at my bed while insects ate me alive ( like sleep paralysis but dreaming?) or just watching my mother being eaten by feral dogs as she protected me."
"So yesterday was my 18th birthday, and here my dumbass was expecting it to be different than all my other ones, but boy was I wrong. It is nice to know that no one gives a fuck about you. You can cry, and scream all you want but at the end of the day, no one is gonna be able to understand you, and the deep well that has been buried within your mind. So what if you grew up rejected by every girl, guy, and person? So what if you have just turned 18 and endured waves upon waves of mental abuse? At the end of the day, when you are laying in your bed, and your demons are starting to swallow you whole and fill up the bowl, what do you do? You face it. You indulge yourself in them until the pain is numb, and you cannot feel anything anymore. It may not be healthy, but it is better than suffering.

Except I am 27 with no degree, no proper work experience, just some odd jobs. I am an embarrassment compared to other immigrants. Last year I began studying for the first time since high school , just to realize the field does not interest me. I barely even understand the language. My GPA is horrible. And I cannot change schools for at least another 2 years due to family. I cannot even get a job because my town has almost none, and the ones it does have are given to the natives (I am foreign). The welfare covers my expenses for now but this is not a life I want to live. I am also anti-social and seem to fit the symptoms of ADHD, but my therapist claims it is just anxiety disorder and does not wanna prescribe any meds yet. I do have a serious learning struggle even when language is not an issue, I cannot seem to grasp the concepts unless teachers spell it out for me. Basically I am unable to learn anything the moment it goes past the basics and it is rather depressing.","School failure I think I am doing something wrong.

"Poor Spring. He tries so hard but sometimes things do not work despite best laid plans. His ex wife is doing isomething' almost every weekend in August and September. So his plan to take me away have dissolved. Thing is.. I kind of think it is a tad bit of not wanting to see him happy. Ex is are so hard to deal with. Look at me and Cretin. He still continues to make our lives a misery on every given occasion. Wait until he finds out I have a boyfriend. It will be 50 questions as to who he is, his family heritage and down to whether we have depraved sexual practices in front of the girls. I also really detest his girlfriend.. Mainly because of the times she is upset the kids. It is not the kids fault. I feel like Small Spring is caught in the middle a little bit and will not have him made to feel bad in any way. So we are not going away in the way we would planned.. We are trying to snatch a night in July maybe? We will see, no pressure. It is meant to be fun not a trial.

"Writing out my feelings in hopes of gaining some sense of catharsis I would like to start by saying I do not think I am a danger to myself. I am tethered here pretty strongly by my family and my best friend. I cannot see myself leaving them, because I have seen what it does to people when those closest to them go. I resent the fact that I cannot go, at times, but there is nothing to be done about it really. Most of the people in my life only ever knew my outer shell. The somewhat false personality that I put on in order to function. Over the last three years my mask has been crumbling away and the results have not been pretty. It is been a viscous feedback loop that leaves me feeling worse and worse as people fall out of my life one by one, either by their own choosing or because I distance myself to hide my pain as I become less and less able to handle it. The summer after my sophomore year I was in the darkest place of my life. I had to pull out of university and move home to get therapy. It was actually very effective, and my junior year was a home run. I was getting the highest test scores in STEM classes with 600 students, I was killing it in my philanthropic efforts, and I had more friends and social obligations than I knew what to do with. My senior year I spent the fall studying abroad in France. It was magical. I fell in love for the first time. I was not reciprocated, but the thing I learned about love is that it does not have to be reciprocated to be the most beautiful thing you have ever felt. When I got back from France, the seeds of my current ruin were planted. All throughout college I would been heavily involved with a camp for kids whose parents have cancer. I did it because my dad had cancer when I was a little kid, and the people I met were all wonderful, but most of all because the only thing that gives me a sense of purpose is helping other people. It drives almost everything I do. This camp gave me a rock that I could cling to through the worst of my emotional storms. The two directors of the camp were both new my senior year. While I was in France, one of them dropped out of school due to her own struggles with mental health. The director that was left over was completely overwhelmed, and entirely ineffectual. People left and right were telling me that I should take the open position. I did not want it; I have ADHD as well as depression and I was so anxious about my lack of organization. Camp was in such a hole though, and for the sake of my friends and my campers and their families I did the only thing I felt like I could do, and took on the directorship. It was rough. My co-director continued to do little of anything, and I felt like I was juggling grenades. I could not fuck this up. Kids I would been mentoring for years needed this camp to cope in a healthy way, and for a number of parent couples, the week of camp was the last time they got to spend alone together before one of them would pass away from cancer. My grades dropped a whole point, on average. My volunteer research suffered, and I really let down the post doc I was assisting (Sorry Bethany). My mental health took a nosedive as well. I made camp happen. It was ugly and bumpy and unorganized, but I made it happen. I took solace in the fact that the kids did not seem to notice the flaws, but it did not do a lot good for my relationships with the other volunteers. I redoubled my efforts at the beginning of my 5th and final year of college. I moved into a house with some of the other volunteers who I was closest to. I had to quit my research, and I could not keep my grades where I wanted them, but camp planning was progressing well, especially after our national organization took notice of the lack of effort on my co-director is part and added a third director, my friend and newly minted roommate A. A helped enormously, but I still had so much on my plate. To cope with the stress, my drug use started to skyrocket. I was smoking weed and cigarettes all the time, and to keep up with all my biochemistry coursework and 8-10 planning meetings a week I was taking my prescribed adderall more often than I should have been. I became thoroughly addicted. In my final quarter of school, everything really fell apart. I was completely overwhelmed, and became less and less effective at my job. I put A in the exact position that I had been in the previous year. I could feel him resent me more and more every day, but I was too ashamed to talk to him about it, and he never asked me how I was doing. I barely graduated. As soon as school was over I quit adderall cold turkey, because it had been putting me in a very dangerous mental headspace for weeks, but until then it had remained a necessity. The withdrawals hit me like a truck. Getting out of bed felt like a truly herculean task. I was an empty husk of a human being and from graduation to camp in August I contributed almost nothing to the camp. I had nothing left to give. A hated me by that point. He began to tell people what he thought of me, and they listened. I watched helplessly as some of my closest friends and roommates began to look down upon me, if not for what A was saying then for my severely depressed behavior. I could not even really blame them. After camp, when we had our traditional fun awards ceremony, A was awarded ""Most likely to make camp happen by himself"". I was awarded ""Linger"", a camp song I was known for singing, but also a very pointed jab. It was humiliating. At the afterparty that night I drunkenly told A everything. He said it was ok, and I cried lying drunk on the porch. I lived in the house with him for a few more months while I looked for a job. A was incredibly distant, and became more and more hostile over time. I got a job on a crab boat. I had a few reasons for doing it, but the most important reason in my head was that I might be lucky enough for it to kill me. The day I moved out A sent me a 6 paragraph essay over text, detailing everything I would ever done that had disappointed him, and letting me know that there was nothing I could ever do to win his respect back. I left the state to work on the crab boat. For 5 months I lived in isolation, either working or chain smoking weed to keep myself from ruminating on all my failures. The crab boat did almost kill me. Multiple times, in fact. In the end I quit, not because I was suddenly afraid to die, but because my captain was the most sadistic piece of human scum I would ever met, and I could not take him any more. I have spent the 5 months since then trying to find a job. 50+ apps out and I am no closer than when I started. I have been up to visit the city I graduated in twice, but both times I have been wracked with crippling anxiety. I can tell how A affected the opinions of some of my closest friends, and it kills me. So, that is where I am. I am going to go smoke a cigarette and pray that I get my dad is cancer even younger than he did.","Writing out my feelings in hopes of gaining some sense of catharsis I would like to start by saying I do not think I am a danger to myself.

"Losing my mind at 20! So the best label I can put is depression I do not know if that is what I am really going through tho long story short I grew up in a pretty bad environment had a single mother (now that I am older I understand stand that it must of been hard being a single mom but what I was put thru is still no excuse)who was very abusive verbally and physically I remember having brooms broke across my back and head for simply spilling a drink, when I was 16 I was stabbed by mother and was taken to the hospital of course like many children who are abused I did not speak up I guess because of fear but more because I did not want to be looked at like a sick puppy over the years I was able to cope with my environment and it became normal the part that I do not understand is when I was 18 I decided to leave and with no real support I was homeless for a bit I used to set daily goals for myself so I would not let depression set in like find a job,etc I bought a car with the little money I had and slept in that and went to the gym to shower strangely enough that is when I was at the most happiness I have ever felt flash a year later I am 19 have an apartment a good job and have the whole world in front of me but I am not happy and it is been a year I am 20 now and feel like I am 60 I have no drive and think about ending my life everyday I just simply feel numb or like im not connected to body I also did not mention that I have siblings and I think about them all the time I think that I am a terrible person for leaving them to live in that environment when I am free enjoying life anytime I feel joy it is instantly sucked from me because I began to think about my siblings and think what they are going thru right now I wonder if they love me or hate me and its been taking a toll on me physically and mentally and at this point I do not know what to do I have not tried reaching out because that would mean I would have to see my mother and I am no longer afraid of her she simply does not deserve to see me at all I sometimes think when she is on her deathbed will she ever feel any remorse for what she has done I also think when she goes to take her last breath will she wonder about me she has not seen me since I left and she will not ever again Any thoughts on what I should do?",-

"A song of fire and ice Hey everyone. I am on mobile so pardon my typos which will happen. I would like to take this time to thank anyone who reads this as well as giving a shout out to anyone currently struggling with depression. I have a long history with Type 1 Bipolar Disorder. Although that is not necessarily depression in itself patients who are Bipolar are bound to eventually oscillate into that emotional polarity. To give a quick summary here is what happened to me: I grew up incredibly wealthy. My Father was an ex alcoholic. My Mother died when I was 13 and my Father went back to drinking to cope with the loss of his wife (my Mother). My Father became suicidal and threw everything we had away. We went bankrupt and I went to live with my Brother across the country. My Brothers wife left him shortly after I moved in. He became suicidal as well, ended up hospitalized. I moved back across the country again to live with my then pseudo homeless Father. One day my Father shows up to my school drunk, gets arrested, I am taken in by the state and put into foster care. I end up living with an incredibly poor hispanic family and eat almost nothing everyday. I have no bed. I sleep on the floor. The state then places me in an incredibly religious home where i essentially become a slave and i cook and clean nonstop for an extremely wealthy catholic couple. They do not like me Because I liked hard rock. My third stay I end up living in a small apartment with a woman who was good at hiding her side prostitution gig and methamphetamine addiction. After all the years my Father gets his life back under control. He begins dating a wealthy woman who is not a fan of me. He takes prolonged stays at her home about 40 miles away. He would visit the house to restock it with food, pay the bills, then leave again. During this time i saw my Father maybe 15 times a year. Each encounter was brief and lasted less than 30 minutes. During this I still went to school, cooked, did my laundry, and did kind of normal kid stuff. The point of this story is I am an adult now who is married. I am a software engineer. I am financially stable. Regardless of how dark it gets it is possible to make it out on top. You have to focus and be strong. Do whatever you need to do to survive. If anyone has any questions or would like to chat, need advice, whatever please let me know. I currently do volunteer work to aid people who suffer from Bipolar Disorder as well as others like ADHD or OCD. I also, accidentally, mentor Fatherless children on Xbox Live (strange, I know). Its not easy out there and world and parents sometimes forget how hard it is being a teen. No judgement. I hope everyone has a good night (or day, depending where you are at).","My Mother died when I was 13 and my Father went back to drinking to cope with the loss of his wife (my Mother).

"I have been in two accidents one in October (went to take pictures of my sister in the parade, she was nominated for homecoming queen), and one in February. The first accident really messed not only my mind, but my body up. Now I am 23, and have severe back, shoulder, and knee pain that I have been treated for, and other pain that I just refuse to go to the doctor for (all from the first accident). I have done the specialist thing, and physical therapy. Nothing has made me feel better other than temporarily (if all I do physically is nothing). I cannot work, clean, or do anything I enjoy without it making the pain worse. I am at my witsi end. I am in the deepest hole I have ever been in. I cannot take having to choose between mental stability, and physical stability anymore. Some days I wonder why I even get out of bed. Nothing good comes out of it. I would give anything in the world to feel better. Last night I just cried myself to sleep, because I am not the only person dealing with this. I take my emotions out on everyone around me including my husband. Lately I cannot help, but think he deserves better. I suppose I do not think I know. Sorry for ranting like this, but I just needed to get all of this out of my head. I thought if it was not in there it would not bother me so much.","Now I am 23, and have severe back, shoulder, and knee pain that I have been treated for, and other pain that I just refuse to go to the doctor for (all from the first accident).

"Cold turkey of Escitalopram So let me begin this by saying this is a terrible idea and I should definitely taper off with the help of my psychiatrist. So, earlier this year after some lack of focus and insistent lethargy eventually my parents decided to take me to a psychiatrist. One thing leads to another and I am diagnosed with depression and put on a dose of escitalopram (generic form of Lexapro) 20mg a day. Have a history of depression on my mother is side, and they had all the symptoms pretty severely minus the suicidal ideation, which I believed supported their diagnosis. So as school was finishing up and I had exams to study for, I spent most afternoons essentially consciously unconscious as I was too tired and struggling to keep a focus on homework and related tasks. Long story short told my parents I had been taking Adderall once and a while and we talked to the psychiatrist and he was very understanding and after trying to allow the SSRI to do its magic, he ultimately added an Adderall script to my regime. So for some months I took the addy as needed and the anti-depressant as described (other than the days I forgot). So fast forward to summer and while I am feeling marginally better, I was lead to believe the addy was doing most of the work. So just last week I decided just to cold turkey the SSRI. Now, this was a slight test of seeing how I would react to abstaining from the meds (which is an awful idea). Strangely, I have noticed no real change whatsoever from when I was taking it to this past week of not taking it at all. I am somewhat familiar with the omens regarding stopping an anti-depressant cold turkey and the associated rebound depression and serotonin-related issues, however, I am unsure why I have not experienced anything. The optimistic side of me wants to explain this as my body just being weird and being able to withstand this drug-related anomaly. The pessimistic side of me believes that it is related to escitalopram somewhat length half-life and that a nightmarish hell awaits me very soon. Just as a side note, at the same time as my depression diagnosis, I also got a blood test which delivered wonderful news that I had Lyme is Disease (which after much reading, I found exhibits many traits of depression and ADHD like disorders) and was promptly treated. Now I do not proclaim to be healed as I still exhibit a sense of lethargy, however, that might just be something I have become accustomed to and given getting out of my house, I am usually able to go out and be alive. Obviously, not discussing this decision with my doctor is unnecessarily dangerous and naive, but I just do not enjoy taking the medication and this past week kind of supports my idea that I do not really need to take the medication if I am able to function fine without it. Forgive me for this whole backstory of my last year, I just was unsure if some of this information might be useful in determining what is happening. **tlr**: got lethargic and lacked focus this last year, diagnosed with depression and Lyme is disease, been on escitalopram since spring and Adderall (whenever I choose to take it) since mid-Mayish. Have stopped taking escitalopram for about a week now and am not exhibiting any withdrawals or issues regarding the cold turkey. My question is: am I an anomaly or am I due for a bitter time in the near future? QUICK EDIT: just wanna say I tried looking up this lack of side effects from cold turkey, but all I can seem to find is the side-effects of not taking the medication, so if someone has some website or anecdotal experience they can refer me to, that would be much appreciated","Cold turkey of Escitalopram So let me begin this by saying this is a terrible idea and I should definitely taper off with the help of my psychiatrist.

"Birthday Vent I have not celebrated my birthday for years now. The most i have received is a happy birthday from my family, while the rest of my family gets full blown celebrations/dinners, etc. So considering everything I went into today expecting just the congratulations and that is it, turns out my entire family went out to eat and celebrate the birthday of a family friend and left me behind.

Now that I am back home, I am back to being just as despondent as I was before. I am cold and distant again. I do not want to talk to anybody. I am back at work, in a horrible job with horrible people. I do not want to talk to my mom because she does not get it and it feels like she cannot be bothered to try.

"Hi everybody! I am new here and I want to tell my story in brief and ask you a few questions. I am 27 now. Female. I am studying on PhD in one of the US universities. I have been suffering from different kinds of psychological problems (mainly, depression) for 7 years already. I always tried to handle my depression by myself. And only once, when depression became unbearable, I went to psychiatrist. I had therapy and AD for a few months. That was about 5-51/2 years ago. Now I have strong depression again. I feel that I cannot handle it by myself and that I am tired of fighting it on my own. That is why I have scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist. My questions: 1. I feel that this depression is different from depressions I experienced before :I started to masturbate like crazy (4-5 times a day) and cannot stop - it has been like this for a few weeks already and I seriously started to think about involving in some homosexual relationship (which I have never done before). I also started to read a lot of porno stories. 2. I am thinking almost constantly about suicide. I mean, I do not think about committing suicide. NO. I WANT TO LIVE. It is kind of obsessive thought playing in my mind: ""I feel bad ..suicide..many people do that..suicide"". It is kind of always in my mind. Sometimes I even have a feeling of the rope on my neck (I do not think about other kinds of suicide which is, probably, explained by the fact that my father hung himself). 3. Where am I going guys? Am I going to some serious psycho disease or what? Am I still normal (I feel like I am still normal). Have you ever experienced something like this? Honestly, what I am afraid of is that at some point I might start seriously consider these suicidal thoughts. I think this is what happened to my dad. 4. I have been here, in the US, only for 1 year. So, I do not know how the system works. If I come to a psychiatrist and tell her that I have these ""suicidal"" thoughts will she make me to be in the hospital (I hate even think about this). Should I even tell her about that? Should I be very honest and open? When I went to our University Health Center to get a referral form, I did not say anything about that. So, I am a bit afraid of trusting a psychiatrist. Maybe, I do not need to tell her everything. What would be your advice? I would greatly appreciate your help. Thanks.","I am new here and I want to tell my story in brief and ask you a few questions.

"I do not know what I am doing anymore I feel empty, I feel bored, I feel depressed and I just want to sleep but even the thought of sleeping while there is so much going on outside this house makes me anxious. Tomorrow I have another test and I am skipping school again. I already skipped today because I was too lazy to start studying before Sunday and of course I did not know shit, so instead of taking responsibility I just skipped school. And I am skipping again tomorrow because I studied even less for this test. My grandpa, the father of my mother, is risking death in an hospital bed. My mother is with him in the hospital everyday and every night to keep him company in his last moments of his life and she cries everyday. It hurts me so see her suffering so much. And it hurts me to see my grandpa in such critical conditions. I feel like they are both miserable but I do not know how to help.

"Ok I have a couple of questions..I guess. 1st is I finally managed to make myself an appointment with a psychiatrist (it is not till May). Now I am having second thoughts about it. I just pretty much want to go in for an evaluation (to see if there is a problem) and see if maybe there is a short term solution for the suicidal thoughts I have been having. I have got a summer job I am leaving for in June and than I am moving to another city after that. (So basically something till I am stable with where I am living and job). I assume I am only going to be able to see 1 doctor, 1 time before than. So 2nd thoughts have been should I just wait to see someone when I actually get settled. Also if a psychiatrist is who I want to see (I have never been to anyone before for my mental health)..that is what the intake coordinator suggested. Also I was wondering if they could hospitalize you for suicidal thoughts without your permission? Ok now on to the suicidal thoughts questions (and just so people know I do not feel myself to be in any immediate or near immediate danger to myself). One main thing is does depression have to be present for suicidal thoughts/actions? I often find my mind turns more to thoughts of suicide and death when I feel relatively normal mood wise. And that when I have feel really depressed the thought of suicide rarely crosses my mind (but the pain is more severe). I guess that is really all I have. Sorry if the topic is inappropriate for this forum. I just wanted to ask..and maybe discuss with someone..but do not really feel that it is a problem for me right now. If someone wants to talk in PMs I would not mind either.","I just pretty much want to go in for an evaluation (to see if there is a problem) and see if maybe there is a short term solution for the suicidal thoughts I have been having.

"I am sort of new.. Here is the short version: I am 26 year old man. Single. No kids. I live in Arizona (USA). My father was a workaholic, and an alcoholic. So usually he was not present, and when he was he was abusive. In addition, mental illness runs in my family. At the age of 5 I was sexually molested by a neighbor. I can recall my anxiety always being there. It is something I have always fought with especially in social situations. My family completely isolated me when I was growing up, in the name of protecting me. As a result I never really learned social skills until I was older. I grew up being abused by my peers throughout school. Found myself taken in by the only people who would accept me as I was: the misfits, outcasts, drug-users. Early into my teen years depression came as an addition to my anxiety. Around 16 I started to get into substance abuse. The only thing I ever used was LSD on weekends regularly. A year later this extended into ecstasy and LSD. I had a traumatic experience and stopped using anything about a year after that. My anxiety became so overwhelming I could not function. So at this time I first started seeing a counselor and a psychiatrist. They put me on Clonzepam. My last year in high school my father was starting to lose it so my mother asked me to leave so we did not kill each other. I had an inheritance from another relative and I lived off that. I went 2 whole years without speaking to my father. I sunk deep into depression, and returned to substance abuse. The Clonzepam was not working anymore. After being outcast from my family, I went full on into the dark side. What was just LSD and ecstasy usage branched into cocaine, meth, marijuana, and virtually anything my friends and I could find. This culminated in an extreme suicide attempt about a year out of high school. After getting out of the mental hospital, I went totally straight and have not touched any drugs since then. The 8 years following have been a rollercoaster. One moment being on top of the world, having everything I could ever want. Another losing everything. Several long horrible relationships occurred in this time. Over the years my doctor has moved me around on various medicines. I have been using Effexor since 1998. Currenlty I take Lamictal in addition to it. I suffer from chronic reoccurring depression, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder.","Early into my teen years depression came as an addition to my anxiety.

My last year in high school my father was starting to lose it so my mother asked me to leave so we did not kill each other.
I went 2 whole years without speaking to my father.
This culminated in an extreme suicide attempt about a year out of high school.
The 8 years following have been a rollercoaster.
I suffer from chronic reoccurring depression, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder."
"Fuck you for being happy around me Goddamn it, I cannot even think straight. I hate the people who make me happy because they choose not to. I am completely alone, and the worst thimg was thinking for a day or two that would not last forever. Except I do not think that, I know that its bot like I have a bad fate, I am not destined to never have any friends and feel this way my whole life. Its stupid to say that I am. Except I am.","Fuck you for being happy around me Goddamn it, I cannot even think straight."
Realizations/habits I have. Anyone else? Talking for too long about something no one cares about. Oversharing my problems when people ask why I am always upset. -Or a reluctance to talk about my problems to someone that actually cares because no one else does. Making unnecessary expensive purchases to temporarily pad my self esteem. Making radical changes to my appearance to seem in control of my life. Oversharing on social media (being too depressing). Waiting for someone to start a conversation with me or initiate a friendship rather than the other way around Feeling entitled to people is time and attention when I hardly give people mine. Either oversleeping or hardly sleeping at all. etc etc etc,-Or a reluctance to talk about my problems to someone that actually cares because no one else does.
Birthdays are the hardest time for me Every year relatives call me and every year same old convo. Anyone special in your life? Any closer to getting married. And I know it stupid but it kills me every time. Because I am not and every year I reflect on spending another year of existence alone and only have another year of loneliness to look forward to. I have tried to immerse myself in hobbies like movies. Focus all my energy on school or working out but I guess some voids are too large to fill.,Birthdays are the hardest time for me Every year relatives call me and every year same old convo.
"I need help Please help, I do not know what is happening and I cannot control my emotions. I am losing it. I went to my mom is house and when I got there, there were guests staying over that I did not know. I have very severe social anxiety so this is not good. When I called my mom before driving to her house, she specifically said that no guests were over and it was okay to come. She lied. I went inside the house and asked my mom about the guests, she told me that she intentially lied to me because she wanted me to come over and knew that I was not going to come over if there were guests there. I freaked out. My mom completely disrespected my boundaries and said the equivalent of fuck your social anxiety, do what I want I quickly left the house and went back into my car. I wanted to leave there because I knew I could not handle socializing with other people. However, my mom followed me back into my car and started to ask why I was leaving. I tell her that she lied to me and I cannot take deal with my social anxiety. She says she does not believe my social anxiety is real (mind you, I have spent two month in a psychiatric hospital last year) and says she wants me to stay. I tell her fuck off and get out of my car but she does not leave. At this point I do not know what to do so I freak out. We have an argument for an hour. She is not leaving my car and is yelling at me. We eventually decide that I should go to my sisters house to sleep. I leave but now I have so much anxiety that I cannot drive. I park my car in a nearby parking lot deciding what I want to do. I have so much anxiety at this point that I made a post of /r/suicidewatch but quickly deleted it. Then my mom calls me and eventually asks me if I am driving to my sisters house. I do not respond to the question because I do not want to lie, and she finds out that Icwas nearby. She freaks out. She accuses me of lying to her when I did not lie. She then takes her car and starts to find where I was. She finds me and then we have an argument for two hours. She keeps on yelling at me saying that I should come back to the house and forget about my anxiety. I tell her I wanted to go back to the psychiatric ward in the hospital and she says that I am being fucking ridiculous and should stop thinking like this. She eventually leaves my car saying that I should come sleep in her house and that everything will be fine. Right now it is 2am and I am still in my car and I am so fucking mentally fucked up I do not know what to do.","I went inside the house and asked my mom about the guests, she told me that she intentially lied to me because she wanted me to come over and knew that I was not going to come over if there were guests there.

"does it ever feel like your friends arent really there? I genuinely care for and love my friends so I regularly ask them how they are doing on messenger since they all live so far away. I know my friends struggle with depression so I make it a point to contact them and let them know I am here for them. But most times I am left on ""read"" or get lukewarm responses, as though they are annoyed. They do not really initiate conversation with me and rarely ask me how I am doing. I hope I do not sound selfish in any way, but it just feels weird to care so much for people who do not seem to care that much for you.

"I have had borderline personality disorder since I was a little kid. Although then the therapist said it was Bipolar Disorder and ADHD. Since then I have been on pretty much every medication you can imagine and even sent to a temporary mental hospital. It is not until now that I self diagnosed myself with BPD. I do not even think my doctor really thinks I have that although considering all the research I have done I fit the description perfectly. Since the age of 13 I was being self destructive by slamming my head in the was during times of stress. The first time I starting cutting was when I was 21. This was after an ex boyfriend left me. We had only been dating for 3 months. Sad huh. This went on sporadically for about a year and a half (during that time I committed myself). Finally I started dating my next boyfriend. He told me if I did not stop cutting he would leave me. I stopped. We dated 2 years and then broke up. I am now 27 and married to another man who is 12 years older than me. We have been married almost a year (together for 3.5 years) and about 3 months ago I started cutting again. This time it is 3 times worse and I cannot seem to stop. I am covered in scars and I have even gone as far as cutting the inside of my wrist. I am currently on Wellbutrin which does seem to be working (I do have a lot of good days). Although since I started to become depressed again I have been having a hard time dealing with the fact that my husband has a son. It did not bother me as much (just a little) before because I did my best to stay busy. Since I got married I lost all my friends and now spend every other weekend alone. Mostly in bed. I never had to play mom before so I never thought I would ever be in the position to, so I just stayed out of the way. Plus, his son does not like me being around. Which makes me feel worse. In my state of mind I cannot deal with that. My alone time is when I cut the most. My husband and I are in therapy, my therapist wants us to work. I am not so sure I can stay with him. Although I am having a hard time leaving. I am just so tired of feeling so alone all the time and he is just not capable of being there for me. This puts extra stress on him and I do not want that. Plus, it is my fault I married him, I knew he had a kid. I guess I did not know I would get bad again. Last week we talked about me leaving. He ran upstairs and cried (he said he will fight for me) I went straight for the exacto knife. I had suicide in mind although I see myself as a wimp in that area which makes me feel even worse about myself. I cut 5 times on the inside of my wrist but I guess not deep enough. He came down and found me. My antidepressants work almost 80% of the time but whenever I think of losing my husband I get sad and hopeless. Every time I think of staying with him and feeling the way I do all the time I get sad and hopeless. I feel cornered. Cutting make it all feel better, suicide sounds comforting. If anyone can relate or has any good advice I am welcome to it.","The first time I starting cutting was when I was 21.

"Today is my 45th birthday. Today is my 45th birthday. Being 45 does not bug me as much as the lack of accomplishments and life lived in those years. I have spent the last 20 years lost in depression. I am tired, hopeless, ashamed, and emotionally defeated. I go to bed scared and wake up disappointed.

"I am a 21 year old male, who has been depressed for about two years, ever since I moved to GA from New York. I have social anxiety, and I am a victim of child sex abuse. I have no friends in this state because I was raised in a minority neighborhood, but in this state, there are only a few. Even in New York, I only have two friends, one who has not talked to me since I moved here. There is nothing worth doing or seeing in this place. There are no buses, trains, malls, sidewalks, coliseums, etc .. I am losing my mind. I do not do anything but go online and watch tv all day. Where is the chat room for this site?

"Am I depressed or just self-pitying? I do not really understand what counts as depression but I have had no motivation to really do anything since as long as I can remember. Sometimes I get a burst of motivation and try to do something but I give up really easily. It is really easy to say that I am depressed as an excuse for the way I feel but I am still able to function so I do not think I can say I am. I still shower, eat, go to work, even the gym sometimes. I am not really close with my family, I rarely talk to them and its only when they talk to me and I am okay with that since I do not really feel like I want to or could hold a conversation with them. Friends I have, I hang out with them sometimes but half the time it feels like a lot of work. I have a girlfriend and I cling to her so hard because I am so happy when I am with her and when I am not with her I am always thinking of her and get sad that I am not with her. She recently told me that the way I think of relationships is immature and she cant offer that much time to me since she has other friends who need her too and get mad at her for not soending enough time with them. I cannot let go of the way I think relatiomships should be and I want her to reciprocate even if I know it is irrational and I do not feel like anything else in life is really worth living for. I am not suicidal though, there is a few times it crossed my mind but I always think about how I would not really ever do it or start regretting it while thinking about it because what if things do get better? Other times I feel like going to sleep one night and not waking up would be nice though.","It is really easy to say that I am depressed as an excuse for the way I feel but I am still able to function so I do not think I can say I am.

"Feeling trapped in my head First off I am Autistic, I am studying at Oxford I am struggling to remember anything, like anything at all, people, faces, dates, facts, etc. I am feeling more and more alone because I do not feel like I have anything good to think about. I have a girlfriend, she is in the forces and has a lot of structure and meaning to her life and I like that but I see my life as completely pointless. So about a year I was cycling in the dark and I was hit by a car, I flew over the bonnet and hit my head. I was out for about half an hour, till I regained conscience in the back of an ambulance, and the crews were cutting off my clothes and pumping me full of morphine. Before this accident I had a very good memory, and my parent would say I could talk about anything that had happened from when I was a child. I was having some weird relationships at the time with different people, and I only came out to them after I was in hospital for a month after the accident, I did not want to say anything because I did not want to worry them. I valued their feeling more over my own life, and I still do that now with other people. Things started to crash after the accident, I lost people really good friends and I knew it was me, and I changed and something during that accident had altered me, and I hated it. I started to forget people very quickly and events that had happened and horribly people who had died and continuously not realising they had died. That upset a lot of people. Before everything happened I had broken up with a girl (but i did not realise that after), now I cannot remember what we did together or even how we met, but I cannot get the thought of her out my head, she later told me to leave never come back, which I did. But even now I still have the feeling of thought of her, and I am struggling to get rid of that, I do not love her and I am not in love her, I just feel like i am obsessed with her a person I know nothing about and It haunts me. I have been to a few separate doctors and have been recommended medication, which I believe it has just made it worse. I have talk to my parents but they just talk highly of the pro is of medication and councillors. Hate councillors. (I always ended up lying to them) Since everything I have had some real down point, and made two attempts, by failed due to people walking in randomly either whilst in progress or while setting up. I have already made necessary precautions by writing letters, addressing them and stamping them but non have been sent. I want to tell my gf but I feel like, I do not want to throw feelings away by her thinking 'he is a sobbing kid, or he is crazy or why am I with him' - I would rather hide it not to upset her, people mean everything in the world to me, and I would give my life for her, any day. But I still want to tell her, and I do not her to be scared of me. When I close my eyes and think of a memory, I just see grey mist or static like of a television. It does not feel nice not having anything to fall back on in your mind, things that made you happy.","Feeling trapped in my head First off I am Autistic, I am studying at Oxford I am struggling to remember anything, like anything at all, people, faces, dates, facts, etc.

"I was just reading back over the past few entries. I have been in tough shape and I did not realize how tough until I read it over. The depression, the arthritis, and the circumstances of my life all have been conspiring to keep me down. My therapist was right, I think, when she said on Monday that I needed sometime to just ""be"". I have stopped answering my phone and have spend most of the past few days watching DVDs, playing computer games and resting my sore body. I feel better emotionally since I have been doing this. I wish I did not feel so horribly guilty for checking out of the world for a few days, but I am willing to cope with it if it makes ma feel a little better. The other thing I am feeling guilty about is this training I am supposed to go to in Washington, DC in two weeks. I feel like if I go I will be letter all sorts of people down at work. I have even contacted the people running the training and asked if I can delay it, but it is now or never and since it is all expenses paid in Washington for three days if I pass it up at the last minute I am screwing someone else out of the opportunity. If I go or if I do not go I am going to feel guilty and selfish. I am not going to decide now though.

"Am I the only one who believes in fantasies and lies to cope with not killing myself? I believe that one day, the girl I like will like me back. I believe that she will reconsider rejecting me, and apologize to me and we can be in a relationship as more than good friends. I believe that I will be prepared for my career when I leave college. I believe that I will find an internship this summer and every summer after that. I believe that I will impress employers with my fantastic resume. I believe that I will make lots of good everlasting friends in college and that I will make even more friends at my workplace in the next three years.

I believe I can graduate with honors, I believe that I will have enough money saved to actually visit Japan.

"People I love keep dying. I cannot take it anymore. On New Year is Eve I got a phone call at 1 in the morning that one of my closest friends died. I did not believe it. I thought it was a joke. It was not. His brother made a post on Facebook letting everyone know. It felt like a bad dream. I could not stop crying. I cried at work. I tried to get time off, but they did not offer bereavement for people who were not immediate family. I was so distraught that I could not go to the funeral. I was afraid to see his body. I hate myself for being so weak. He was 28. It should not be. He should still be alive. Four months later, my grandfather died. We were close. The last time we talked he said ""that is my sweetheart, that is my pride and joy."" I sat with him in the hospital and watched Aubrey Hepburn. We promised to see each other again soon. I saw him a week later in hospice. He was catatonic. I told him it was okay to let go, okay to move on if he was in pain. They say hearing is the final sense to go. He died thirty minutes after I left. On July 1st my mother told me that she is been diagnosed with cancer. They took a biopsy of her lymph node yesterday to see if it has spread there. She is on a month of leave from work. That was the final straw for me, I think. I feel like a shell of who I was before December 31st. I am terrified of the future. I remember when my friend died, I asked myself who I would lose next. I had no idea things would spiral down and down. Everyday is a struggle for me to stay at work. All I want to do is sleep. I have constant migraines (a chronic condition), and the pain paired with the grief is absolute hell. I started seeing a counselor about a month ago, and I like her but she can only do so much. I am on medication, and I have a good support system. But the sorrow is just overwhelming. I feel like this grief is never going to end. I was not ready to say goodbye to them. I do not want to lose my mom. I am not even thirty. I am not ready to wake up knowing that she is not with me anymore. I cannot take anymore. I have been crying all day.

"Any advice on how to handle leaving my only friend? LAST thing I need right now is the pain but I think I have to. I have posted here a few times before and never got much for replies, which is ok. I really do hope I can get some insight on this particular issue however. For so long I have been completely alone and it really sucked. I managed to connect with my Cousin a couple of years ago and we have had a lot of great times, but more often than not lately it seems I feel bad after dropping her off instead of good that we hung out. We have hung out like 3 times a week for a couple years now. I feel like we have a real connection but she does not show it if she feels the same. I am an alcoholic and so is she, so we drink together a lot. I certainly would be able to quit if I did not have to drink to be around her. Besides the booze I have no idea what other drugs she is into; I know coke for sure, probably smoking crack time to time, she is made jokes about wanting to go out and do meth all night. She is CONSTANTLY lying to me about everything. She is so very unreliable, in the last 2 weeks twice now she is made plans with me for the next day, only to show up on facebook at like 8pm after I have been sitting and waiting for her all day and then she gets angry with me for telling her it makes me feel like shit. Everything is always about her, she is even more depressed than me and has none of the coping skills I do so most of the time it is just her bringing up all her problems and me trying to reassure her. If I try to talk about my issues though she pays no attention and changes the subject. I know she is not really a ""friend"" more of a ""company prostitute"" if anything, it seems like I am always having to buy the booze or lend her money she never pays back. I know I am being blatantly used, but the company is still better than being alone with my thoughts all of the time. She actually ""ghosted"" me about a year ago for a few months and that put me in a really bad place, I had to check into the psych ward I was in such a rut over it. When we finally started hanging out again she did not seem to care at all the pain it caused me, and I still have never heard an answer ""why"" she would block me and dodge my calls or visits out of the blue. I feel like she is getting worse and no matter how hard I try I cannot help her or make her seem to care. I do not think I can handle the pain of losing my ""friend"" again. I also have OCD and I obsess on things to ridiculous lengths and this is going to suck me into a dark hole for a long time.

"I do not think who try to kill themselves actually want to die From my experience and one of a close friend who almost died in a car accident, I think people do not really want to die. We just want the pain to go away. All the shit we take and all the heavy baggage we have to carry, just makes us tired and lose hope When we ponder on death, we see an easy way out, so as to get rid of the unbearable agony we suffer. Moreover, I watched a video of suicide survivors. About those 7% who survived suicide, claimed that in their final moments, when they were throwing themselves from a high place, they said they would regret everything and wanted to live. Now imagine all those who died and regretted in the last moments. Personally, I have been close to do it, but my online friends gave me so much support and so much love that I noticed that it is not worth it. I still have things I want to do. Sure getting out of bed is still a huge task. Today it took me 2 hours just to do it, but I did it. I am not sure if I should have posted this in suicide or here as it has to do with both. Depression sucks, that is a fact we all know, but suicide is not the way to go.

Talk about depressing!! oh, wait, I already was I have very low motivation, I do not feel like socializing or talking to anyone and some days I do not even want to go out of the house. I have to get up everyday though as I have to care for my daughter while husband works, even when I was working it was still me caring for our daughter and doing everything else around the house .. yes, I am resentful too. I have no thoughts of self harm or suicide, just very negative and unhappy all the time. I have found that the Effexor has made me more relaxed , less anxious and less irritable. But the insomnia is horrible, I was having interrupted sleep before being put on medication and really wanted something that would help me sleep .. rrhmm. Is anyone else on Effexor and find it beneficial for them. Just wanted to introduce myself and hear from others.","My Supervisor did not want me returning to work while experiencing side effects ..

"I feel so down and disappointed sometimes I am 29 female and on verge of breaking down completely. I am facing a lot of rejections in life only because I do not look so beautiful in front of others eyes. I just do not believe that saying ""Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder"" .

How is ""doing I like"" helpful when I do not like anything? When I do not about anything I am doing? That is the reason I stopped doing first place. How is doing those things again going help me? This is like the biggest suggestion I have seen and I think pretty unhelpful. I cannot just make myself care. I have tried. I wish I could care about those things again but I cannot so suggesting to do those things, as if I wanted to stop, is like a punch to the face. ""Oh your depressed? Just do what you like."" No. I do not want to. I do not want things I loved and feel nothing. It hurts to want to enjoy life and cannot. To want to care and you just cannot. I have tried medication and therapy.

"Thinking of quiting my job I work as a waitress and it is killing me inside. I have anxiety along with depression and having to answer phones, greet customers, small talk etc is just exhausting for me. I also do not get along with some people there. My boss and the chef mainly. I get really anxious the entire day beforehand (work evenings) and it just puts me in a bad spot. Another reason for wanting to quit is I am currently a student and I am in the last leg of my final year dissertation, I just do not want the stress of having to go deal with my boss and having to take orders etc when I have this important deadline coming up. The only problem is it is my only income. I do not want my boyfriend getting mad at me because he has to support me with his shitty job for a couple of months untill my project is over and I can find a better job.

"I feel trapped in a life I do not want to live. It took a lot of time for me to consider posting here but I am gonna be alone for the whole day and cannot deal with it. So, hi, I am just your typical British kid dealing with the stresses of College but the problem is that I am not stressed because of college (I do not really care much for it but it is better then work), I am stressed because of this constant cycle of: wake up, spend an hour trying to get up, be 20 minutes late to everything every day, eat, browse the Internet and sleep. All around me there is people who have clear career paths and know what they are passionate about, but I look at myself and realise that I do not have that. I have no interest in working in a job for the next 45 years of my life because there is nothing that I would like doing. I am doing fine in all of my classes (As in History and Cs in Maths, Distinctions in BTEC Engineering, everything just feels too simple) but I just still get these weeks where I feel worthless and pointless. I get brain fog, I end up teary eyed and cannot talk to anybody for fear of looking stupid (I have speech problems). But then when I end up actually talking to others I apparently look happy. I have spoken to people at my school about it, but it is the same thing every time. 'Oh you are struggling? We will have a five minute conversation about your feelings and wait months to make sure you are not still sad'. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I stopped taking medication in July 2017 and have not seen a doctor or therapist since. They did not help, the medication I was on turned me into a god damn zombie and my therapist got exceptionally pissy at me for not telling the truth about my lack of improvement. I felt like I had to lie so I did not waste their time and mine, I worry that is why I end up wearing a mask 90% of the time. Even around my family, who believe more in self-help then actually getting an actually decent therapist to try and help me. I am ashamed to talk to them about it, no matter what anyone says, trust me when I say that they will NOT understand. I have been incredibly clear about it all and got mocked for it, some people just do not want to learn. I had a pretty bad childhood that I try to justify my problems with (dealt with a lot of sexual abuse and my mother died in 2013) but when I am having these wouldays' I am not thinking about anything in particular that would make me flighty. I ended up admitting a lot of my past to one teacher last week who I admire greatly and whom pretty much just saved my life and I am still cringing today. I know I have no reason to cringe either, I just get so nervous of social interaction. I just do not get why the universe picked me to be its miserable little experiment. I never asked for anything bad to happen, I never asked to constantly feel tired and under the weather, I know that life is not gonna be perfect but why is it that day after dull ass day I have to feel worse and worse? I try to take responsibility for my health, I feel like dirt, I have other people have some part in it and they take it for granted and hardly any of them actually make a big effort on me. Sorry if my words are jumbled and rambled, I just needed a place to vent whilst I still can.","But then when I end up actually talking to others I apparently look happy.

"That eternal slumber I am tired. I am not here to be saved. I am nearly 40: have a career, a SO, friends &amp; family who care for me but it will never be enough to keep me around. I have been depressed since age 8, my first suicide attempt was at 11 and I am convinced my life will end by my own hand eventually. I have lurked here but never posted. I had to reach out somehow and was not going to call or text the goddamn crisis line. The world sees me as happy and outgoing even when I am honest about my depression b/c I do not SHOW it to anyone.

I feel incredibly lonely and miserable, I barely can rack about 3 hours of sleep a night and at school I feel like an idiot because I can barely focus on anything. Anyways, maybe beating cancer isnt really something to be ""proud"" of. I am no fucking warrior. I am terrified about the whole thing.

"I walked out of a job yesterday. I took my wouldream job' in early January, only to discover that it is not my dream job at all. I thought I would like working in a medical office, but this particular medical office has two doctors, one part-time staff member, and a cluster of other problems. I quit on Friday; the owner asked me to come in yesterday and meet, and I did, but I did not stay long, because she did not show up and the other doctors on staff acted like my resignation never even happened. I have compiled a list of why I quit. Here is a short sample: - I hate the hours (7A-7P 3 days a week, 7A-2P 2 days a week; an hour lunch break was promised in the new hire handbook but is frowned upon by staff as a lack of commitment/dedication) - There are religious currents, including periodic 'prayer meetings' throughout the day. I was treated dismissively when I objected and stated I am not religious. The owner is okay with the prayers, and says it brings staff closer together. - I was offered a management position, but after being hired, was told ""I know nothing, and might manage eventually, but right now was incapable of doing so."" - I was trained for three or so days before being expected to run insurance billing, keep rooms clean and do therapies, and run the front desk. - Staff is expected to remain available on evenings and weekends for PR events. I know that quitting was the best decision - ""sticking it out"" would have been detrimental to my mental health, and I would have had no time to interview for other opportunities. Still, at the same time, I cannot help but feel like a burden to my husband. After leaving yesterday, I hiked 4 miles to the top of an area mountain (really just a big hill, it is a foothills mountain) and had a conversation with myself as to whether or not I intended to jump. I intentionally did not take my gun with me because I never know. I am afraid of being a disappointment, and I am afraid of never being a 'conventional,' 'functional' human. I am second guessing my decision to leave. I already have other opportunities presenting themselves to me and I am lucky enough to have some money put away.. but I do not want to be a failure. I can feel depression symptoms creeping up on me again, and I am trying to fend them off. I forced myself into a per-diem position today, just to keep in a routine. I am trying to re-frame this as an opportunity, but right now, it feels like a literal nightmare.","I thought I would like working in a medical office, but this particular medical office has two doctors, one part-time staff member, and a cluster of other problems.

"I have had no energy to do anything the last couple of days and I am really struggling to get out of this funk I have had problems with depression for years so none of this is new to me, but I am having a really rough couple of days and think I would like to just talk with someone. Today is the second day I am missing classes. My first one starts in an hour and I live too far away to get there in time at this point. I could not get out of bed, and had the same problem yesterday. I just get this feeling of dread when I think about getting ready and actually leaving, and all I feel like I can do is lie in bed thinking about different ways I could kill myself (I am not going to, it is just something I seem to always end up thinking about in bed, I know it is toxic but it is comforting). I really cannot miss any more classes after today, this semester is really important for my grades. I feel like such a piece of shit for missing them two days in a row, this is the exact sort of thing that fucked up my grades last term. Idk it would be nice to talk to someone, about anything even.

Well I bought the TENS machine. got it set up earlier and decided I was in SO much pain across my shoulders that I would set it at the neck shoulder setting and on the MOST intense setting due to the pain and the desperation I was feeling. Well that was a mistake it is like being stabbed with a pointy stick - so I reset it to the minimum setting. it has helped a little perhaps I should use it more often to a) get used to the feeling b) get rid of the pain as I am in LESS pain now but it has not gone altogether would I recommend one let is just say I need a few more days to decide but for now I am in slightly less pain than I was,-
"Does Trading Help Your Depression? Maybe I am a bit weird in this regard, but I do quiet well in this regard. I have not traded too much because of life circumstances, and thus the past few years have been depressed, as my one best friend is in jail and the other has adopted asceticism. I also moved to a new area and broke up with my ex. I have been thinking stuff over, and even though winning at coding can make me slightly happy, I feel like whenever I am trading I am on fire and feel like my ""true"" self, whereas otherwise I feel blah. When I mean trading I mean medium term investing based on value investing. IDK if the risk and reward part overruns me, but when I think about that I do not think about my lack of dating or how this or that sucks, I focus on kicking ass and taking names.

"I Empathize More With the Dead Than I Feel Bad for the Living There have been a few times in the past few years where I found out someone I went to high school with died of whatever means. But within the past few months, whenever I found out someone died, I did not really feel bad for their family, I mostly was kind of jealous that they were gone and I was still here. For example, my mom manages a nursing floor at a hospital. She told me one of her nurse is daughters died of a deadly disease at 20. And all I could think about was at 21 all I could think was how jealous I was of the deceased young woman, and how lucky she was. No ill will to her, I hope she rests in peace and that her family is coping. Another example. When I was in high school, someone I knew had an older brother than went out drinking one night and when he came home, he died, choking on his own vomit.

"I feel really bad for not coming to the forum much last week. i have been in turmoil. Things at home are not going well at all. My husband got his new house and is moving in the next few weeks .. incidentally that is not the problem. I am happy that he is leaving. He has been a real jerk lately. He says mean things to me and he is angry all of the time. He has been working on the road for the past month so we only have to tolerate each other on the weekends - thank goodness. When he comes home the first thing that he does is go up to the computer room and say hi to his buddies .. not to me and not to our son (in fact he only spend a total of one hour with our son on the weekends). When he finally graces us with his presence he just complains. I did SO much work around the house last week - I cut the grass, weeded the garden, watered the lawn everyday, vacuumed the house from top to bottom, washed the floors on the main floor of the house, did all of the laundry, patched some dents in the walls and painted them, cleaned out our son is room .. and still he managed to find things that were 'wrong'. He even had the audacity to tell me that I am a pig and nothing gets done around here. I just cannot take it anymore. All he does is get angry and complain. I finally realized this weekend that I am not his problem. He is just using me as an excuse. I have tried to talk to him and all he wants to do is play the blame game. We have agreed to not see each other for the month of august so that each of us can decide what it is that we want to do regarding our relationship. Even that ticked him off. When I asked him if he would like me to send our son with his parents when they come to visit him he got mad that I was not going to come see him. The 'no seeing each other in August' was entirely his idea. I have no clue what is going on in his head. I have tried and tried to talk to him and the only reply I get is defensive or aggressive. I am at my wits' end and am about to give up. I care very much for him and I know that there is something wrong but I cannot help him. I am so afraid of giving up on us though because I am riddled with the 'what ifs'. I want a family so bad. am I settling though? I hate saying that because my husband is not a terrible man. He has his finer qualities it is just that lately they are few and far between. He has even told me that he would cheat on me if given the chance. And that he might have while drunk one night and that the girl has told other people that the baby she is carrying might be his. You know the more that I write the more I feel like an idiot. What a fucking doormat. What the hell am I doing? i am putting my happiness and wellbeing on the back burner for someone who has told me repeatedly that he no longer loves me and thinks that he has had an affair (or at the least would like to). How pathetic can you get. What a glutton for punishment I am. Why is it that I feel that he is more important than me? You know I thought that I was doing better on the medication - I might not be having the emotional outbursts but I still have the low - or should I say non-existent self esteem. If only all of this could be over. If only he could either WAKE up and figure out what he wants to do or just fuck off and never see me or our son again. That would make my life so much easier.

"I have been so depressed over a lost friendship. I have known this girl for about 5 years. We were very close or so I thought. We both had boys around the same age, went on vacations together with our families, and both went through our 2nd pregnancy together. I knew she was a person that had to have things her way but I accepted this. She has a large circle of friends that she included me in. I felt her family was mine, in a way. I am very shy and came out of my shell. Last year I got caught up with 2 other friends that were having problems. They really needed me. So I was not around much but I am always available if she needed me. Anyway, we got into a misunderstanding over something very minor. I really did not think much about it the next day. That is the way I am. I get mad then I am over it within 24 hours. She is not like that. She holds grudges. I saw her the next day (4th of July) at her house. I knew she did not really talk to me but she did have a lot of people there. Well,a couple of weeks after I call her saying ""Hey girl, can I pick land on up?"". She said ""How can you call and act like nothing is wrong?"" Then she hangs up on me. I wait until the next day and called again. First thing she says is ""What do you want?"" I say ""Just to be your friend."" She says ""We are no longer friends. There will be no more double dating with our husbands, vacations, you are to not come to my house, We are not friends"". I was blown away. I asked what I did and she could not give me a direct answer. She said we had different friends and I had more drama than any of her friends of 20 years. I asked her what drama? Last year I had some problems with my husband but I did not really talk to her about that. She said that was a problem, I did not tell her things and that is what friends do. WHAT? She was contradicting herself. She hung up on me again. It is very difficult for me because when I make a friend and let them into my heart they are my friend for life. Her son is my son is best friend and her husband is my husbands best friend. I had recently told my husband to not mention their names around me because I become really depressed. My poor son does not understand why she does not like me anymore. How can I explain when I do not know. I bought her daughter a shirt about a month ago and she did not acknowledge it until she saw me in Walmart a week later and we were face to face and she thanked me. It was very weird. I have not seen her since July. I cannot let my son have his friend over anymore because it hurts too much to see him and know that I am not welcomed in their home and they have not asked my son over their house since all of this even though he still came over ours. I cannot figure out what I did that was so bad. I wish I knew so that maybe I could at least defend myself and have some closure.","Last year I got caught up with 2 other friends that were having problems.
I saw her the next day (4th of July) at her house.
There will be no more double dating with our husbands, vacations, you are to not come to my house, We are not friends"".
She said we had different friends and I had more drama than any of her friends of 20 years.
Last year I had some problems with my husband but I did not really talk to her about that.
She said that was a problem, I did not tell her things and that is what friends do.

"Recovering from an abusive ex So I have stopped seeing a guy who was emotionally manipulative and abusive towards me. Honestly I feel so alone and hopeless.

"Insurance for therapy? I have decided to look into getting a therapist to deal with issues of depression and anxiety. I am still on my parents insurance plan which should cover most of the cost. However, I have heard it can be a bad idea to use insurance to pay for therapy as insurance companies can audit your sessions to see if you still require them to keep paying for it. I am concerned about privacy and having trouble getting insured in the future with mental health issues on my record, but paying out of pocket is not a great option either as I am currently a broke college student. Anyone have a similar situation?","I am concerned about privacy and having trouble getting insured in the future with mental health issues on my record, but paying out of pocket is not a great option either as I am currently a broke college student."

"My purpose for posting this is that I am at a dead end and do not know where else to turn. I am 39 and I am sure have been suffering from depression most my whole life. My life has been one failure after another, in relationships, jobs, and anything else. I had been on antidepressants for about 10 years and then stopped after I got arrested for a DUI and felony hit and run. The man who was injured received a cut on his face after chasing after me when I split the scene, that was the whole extent of his injuries. After the arrest I was feeling so bad it made no difference whether I took them or not. The charges were dropped but I had to wait day after day for a year or more just waiting for them to recharge me, which my attorney was sure they were going to do. That was 2 years ago and I think the experience did some very serious and real damage to me. I just lost my job in my probationary period of 2 months. I have worked so hard to create some kind of financial security for myself (BA in Psychology, technical degree in computers, numerous computer certifications) but where ever I go I do not fit in to the group and find myself alienated and let go. Some many failed romantic relationships, never having friends, and what family members I have are abusive and are incapable of providing healthy support. Most nights I calm myself enough to fall asleep by fantasizing about killing myself and the relief that was provide. I feel like a freak physically. I shortened my fingers on my right hand by 1/2 inch and my hand is deformed because I hit the wall in my apartment one night about 4 years ago after I was let go from a job and my girlfriend broke up with me at the same time. Of course what I have stated so far is not close to all that is weighing on me. Now I am just so tired and hopeless I do not know how to get the energy to try again. Any encouragement or wisdom the read / you can provide is very much appreciated.

"Is it better to find out your love was a lie, or never to have loved at all? Last year, after 16 years of marriage, my wife says she never loved me, has never found me attractive (who can blame her), and does not think we have ever been right for each other. She only married me because she felt pressured from family and church to get married, and I was a ""good guy"", as she puts it. This crushed me. She has been everything to me. I have always loved her so much. My whole marriage has always been a fairy tale for me, it was everything I wanted. This was the girl of my dreams. I remember thinking when we were dating that it was too good to be true that any girl, especially one as amazing as my wife, would ever like me, since I am shy, boring, and ugly. I guess I was right, it was too good to be true, and I should have trusted my gut and known it back then. After a year of trying to find ways to connect with her, make myself more attractive to her, and hoping she would love me, I have finally accepted that she never will. We are staying together for the kid is sake, and really for mine, what else would I do, no one else could ever love me, and I doubt I could ever really love anyone else the way I loved my wife. I have accepted that I will never have love. It makes me wonder, is it better to have thought I had love, and enjoyed it, only to find out it was lie, or never to have loved at all. At this point I really do not know.","Last year, after 16 years of marriage, my wife says she never loved me, has never found me attractive (who can blame her), and does not think we have ever been right for each other.

"My Fictional Home I stared outside, and watched the cold atmosphere awake me. The sun is rays blocked by the magnificent beauty above us all; an urban scape filling my view around me. I felt a grave sadness strike all in the same spots for my daily routine, crippling what was left of my head. I grabbed the bicycle, and went along the path to any good in my life. 'A nearly missed accident up ahead,' I reminded myself. I hit the button to change colors, and awaited a stop that could mean a sour tardiness or a decent morning. The color changed fast, and I hastily sped across the lines between me and the other side. I arrived, striking the pavement at full speed ahead down the rubber sidewalk. A straight path to follow, a new future to envelop soon enough. The fact of the matter was that I had to pray to a god I did not believe in if I wanted to warp my happy spirit to glorious utopia. Logic overrides hearts quite rarely, leaving a snowflake and a shock of noise behind the mind that just wants it all to change. My bored mind only somewhat consciously bobbed his head around from side to side, keeping an eye on the reflective sign for a change of heart. The observant man coming by on a bicycle or on his own two legs could notice the hurting expression that shone on my face. An insomnia that has outlasted its course, half a heart to spare to the one it belongs to, and the tonnes lying on his stubby shoulders. Whether the man is out to care for their dog, the mail, something; they always take a look to glance at the face of a broken child, often not realizing the fine details in the street lights glowing on my frozen cheeks. 'What did it take to find redemption?' I often wondered, as grand sunlight was walking upstairs to knock the moon off it is sleepy stool. I sat and watched a beautiful red giant approach, and drew images in mind to flicker about and echo in my concave dome of secrets. As the flickering opportunity ran full speed in front of me, I turned and felt the imagery toss into the incinerator. A great insecurity washed over the industry working ahead up above, slowing me down as I walked in slowly toward the place to call work. I sat the bicycle at it is rack, hands in pocket as I blinked at the glaring sun. A numbness hit my heart, and for the next eight hours, I would lose who I was, only coming back at the rise of a pounding rain. I walked from a distant building, taking the long path to a home that did not know me. I took the rugged bicycle, and stared up above at the shadowy clouds. I leaned forward over the handlebars, watching the patterns fly past my visions. I lifted up again, opening my voice to play a tune, looking for a face to redeem my little work. I went onward, and stared at the home that forgot me. I walked slowly up, placing the bicycle just where it was, hitting the kickstand which had sacrificed my ankle some. I opened the door, giving a brief greeting. I entered the meeting room of regrets and lost innocence, stroking my hands over what was a cuddly friend. My vision blurred, feeling the great exhaustion from the night prior taking me over. I curled in the corner, feeling the toilets flushing the pent up pains from an earlier disembarkment of a peanut gallery. I hugged the one thing that brought a soothing to my life, and proceeded to let out an ugly sob, trying to remember who everyone was, as I grabbed a broken mirror, staring at who the blurry stranger was in it. I felt myself faint, awaking to two strangers cycling the door between storage and the hands of all waiting for me. What were you thinking? the woman asked, What did you say? the man asking. I do not know. I responded, lying on my side, as they both awkwardly stepped out, with a cracked expression of what was me walking out. I felt a blankness ride across my body, as I stared upon a wall that reminded me of life. I sat stationary, and buried my head under a recording of a person with nothing left. I held my heart, staring out at the dark that I wanted to escape in. A length that no person dared, but a low that felt necessary. I felt an unnecessary realism flow through me, as my arms folded, feeling a coldness drip down my neck. I got up, and went to the porch of attempting life again. A moon vanished above me, showing a pine away from me only just by some measurements. The bicycle appeared broken on the road, as I walked to what I remember being the last resort in this world. I walked to a reused bench, and stared out at the murky waters that felt like memories. I looked to my left, seeing a young boy sitting in the back of a delinquent is wagon, and to my right a child amongst a smaller group, enjoying the finer delicacies of life. In between it all, a fool. I cracked my bubbly back, as a soreness hit my veins. I stood slowly, my body tossing and turning inside. The world turned askew, as the sun beat slowly onto my flustered body. I took flight across the ramp of a broken dream, taking a flip that would ruin me for a day. A nostalgia for the life that was simple broke me down slowly, as I felt my walking slow down. I sat by a curb, watching a teenager go away from a regretful sunset on a bench. He sported a terrible frown, forgetting of the one. A light flew by at fast speeds, turning away from my stretched out legs, as a noise emitted from it is front. I stared blankly into the street, feeling my mind shatter into many jagged pieces. A dam blocked the feeling of humanity and a progress of going up in the world. I picked up the pieces, attaching them to my hurting consciousness. I stomped back to a filthy bed, staring into the bright light that fueled no purpose. I spread a message, the bait missing all parties. I collapsed, waking to a time of no reply. I logged into what made time fly by, and felt the pains of months wash away within seconds. A second half had joined, and I forgot about all the things around me for the next year. Dawn upon myself shined my sleepy public works to let out a shrieking cry, standing over a bin full of scraps and desperation to fix my bleeding innards. I panicked into a corner, awaiting life is worst terrors. I stood to nothing, and returned to a hamper of depression. I stared at the dusty fan blades fly full speed, breathing in only to glance at the horrid truth. A shadow stood behind my forgotten figure, taunting the fullness above it. I wore a jacket and yelled at it, and it shyly walked. I took a deep breath and walked outside toward the bench once again, staring out at the beautiful waters. A creature came from the waters, approaching me. I held its hand, standing up accordingly. The creature pushed me into a pit full of spikes, as I awoke to half of me missing. I felt a burning inside of me, as my insides waned into a fine drawing of genitalia, washing the deliberate feeling and thought around my head, causing me to let out of a horrific screech of losing a natural ability. My body awoke in a new person is home, as I stared out into the busy road below my sleepy figure. An old woman came out from the corner, as I nervously responded with a gulp. We shared an exchange, as I sat and pondered the shelves of a life that I knew little about. I explored the past, only finding multiple recordings of enthusiasts. I folded my hands, recognizing that I meant nothing here. The plane flew slowly away, as the shock went away from my skull, as my heart was left with a small hole. I sat and could not breathe, only feeling a great pain as we jumped into the chair of obnoxious actions. I sat and thought, glancing at the broken mirror. It was me.","A great insecurity washed over the industry working ahead up above, slowing me down as I walked in slowly toward the place to call work.

"I am sitting here at what is my 26th or 27th job (I can barely keep count. I am 27 years old by the way). I already hate it and I have been here one month today. I do not think it is normal to have this many jobs over a lifetime, let alone when you are just in your late 20 is. I have applied for disability before but was denied. I do not dispute the fact that I can get a job, I just cannot keep a job. I get bored, I get anxiety attacks, I get to the point where I do not want to go outside at all. I will never be able to work (successfully) with all those things going on. When I went to see an attorney to appeal my disability decision, he said I should find a job with minimal responsibility. What kind of job is that? Do not you have to be responsible enough to at least come to work (and on time)? Do not you have to be responsible to follow the rules of the job? I cannot seem to do either one. Each job I get, I think ""maybe this can be the job I can stay at"" and it never happens. The longest I have ever stayed at a job is 1 year. I just feel like such a loser. Everyone I know always says they will do whatever kind of job for their kids, or I should be lucky to have a job. I can see their point, but when I feel so miserable I cannot see past that. I drag myself to jobs only to end up quitting or getting myself fired. What is wrong with me? Any advice?

"Hi, everyone - new to these forum board thingies so please forgive me if this does not end up being posted in the right place! I have lived with depression since I was 14 years old (I am now 43). For the past 10 years I have been managing this condition without the aid of drugs or stimulants. My life changed the day I stopped fighting the ""condition"" and accepted it as part of who I was. Acceptance is the greatest gift you can give yourself on the road to recovery, not only does it take away the stigma, it also gives the fear nothing to feed on. For those of you who are still in the depths of darkness, please do not give up hope, there are many of us out here who, have experienced exactly what you are going through now, we survived - so can you. Recovery is possible, it just takes time and a little faith in yourself.

"Lonely and stupid. I feel so stupid. I have always been academic and studious- if anything, I have dedicated my existence to the pursuit of knowledge, at the expense of forming human relationships. But I am constantly overwhelmed by how much I do not know, how slow I am to understand concepts, and how my peers are all more intelligent than me. I know it is impossible to always be the smartest person in the room, but I feel that the fruits of my studies are disproportionate to my efforts. At the same time, I have conflicting feelings over my loneliness. I desire human interaction, but others find me rigid and distant. In all honesty, I am easily bored by small talk and trivial discussions. I understand that it is important in forming friendships, but my under-stimulated brain seems to automatically ishut-off' after a while. I have noticed that the people I do get along with are like me. Introverted, cold, and academic. We do not see each other as people, but as enlightened books with fresh concepts. These ideas are interesting to explore. If the book is lost, we are disappointed but not crushed. We were never bound by friendship; we were tied by our interests and perhaps mutual isolation. I do not feel an ounce of human warmth from these acquaintances.","I feel so stupid.

"I think i am okay, but in reality and in hindsight I am completely not okay. I think I am literally dying day by day. Hello to anyone out there, I am just a good guy who did not come from much and I am trying my best to live a fulfilling life but I do not think I can anymore because of this illness. I use to be quite a geek as a kid and love video games and playing with others and having fun. I remember when I use to look forward to coming home from elementary school or middle school and just do my homework and then game away. It was so much fun then and I felt like I was genuinely pretty happy. Now a days I feel like i am just literally dead. I do not do anything, I cannot sleep, I hardly eat because I cant find the motivation to go out and get food.. and over the past 4 years I have noticed that depression really has taken a toll on me mentally and physically. It sucks so bad that I genuinely think I will probably die prematurely and die lonely. I have no friends, no acquaintances, and just family that do not understand anything about what i am going through. To be honest I wish I was never born. I wish i did not exist because facing the world is killing me. Just the other day I thought about all the opportunities i have missed out on because of my depression. Like internships, jobs, career fairs, fun events and even a potential awesome friend but all of that is not going to happen because i am as dead as a rock. I turned 22 a couple days ago and no one even said happy birthday..Not even family. At this point i am looking at my future and its looking dim. I have simply lost the meaning of living. I have no self esteem, no confidence, nothing. Maybe people like me do not deserve to live a good life, perhaps we ought to die and just get over it. If there was someone who can tell me my fate i will want to listen to it now. I just cannot anymore. I fucking just want to run the bridge and jump off but sadly i recognize that I only have one life. I am hoping and hoping maybe everything can turn around for me but what are the odds to be honest. I might as well have a heart attack and just die. I hate this. I am lonely, i am always sad and i am just a piece of shit that is worthless. Good Bye everyone. I hope you have all had an awesome day. As for me everyday is the same and if things do not change soon I think i will rather end it. Not even graduating college meant anything for me.

"I feel doubts about my relationship when I am depressed? I am 25/M. I am gay and I have been with my boyfriend J for five months. I used to be severely depressed. But lately my life has been pretty good. But sometimes I get into a depressed mood and I start having doubts about my relationship. Honestly nothing is really wrong between us. But sometimes I feel like I do not really love him, and that we do not actually have any chemistry. And I do not know why I feel that way. I start nitpicking our relationship and try to find flaws in it to justify how I feel. But other times we will both be in a good mood, and the spark is totally there, and I feel great about everything. I am starting to think that this is just what my brain defaults to when I am sad, and that there is nothing actually wrong with us. For example this weekend I was feeling great, then on Sunday my parents had a conversation with me that really triggered me, and now I am feeling depressed and doubting my relationship. (The conversation with my parents had nothing to do with my boyfriend.) Basically it seems like whenever I feel down, my brain immediately jumps to ""maybe I should break up with my boyfriend."" I do not know if this is a sign that something is actually wrong, or if this is just what a depressed brain does. Does anyone else experience this?

We work together and she liked me alot but since im a manager and shes an employee, we had to keep it a secret but people were already starting to spread rumors about us and my GM who wasntnearly as suspicious about it cut her hours and days for this week and i asked why. His response was that she was flirting with alot of other guys and it was becoming a problem so he cut her days to just 1 this week. When she saw the schedule she thought about us and how it was a bad idea to date and it wouldnt be a good idea anymore since she doesnt want to lose her job.

"Advice for getting back in touch with everyday life? I think the hardest thing for me, and the largest factor I need to address to try and feel healthy again, is simply trying to feel engaged in and enjoying the present. Right now, days have little to no meaning at all, and I am only really able to think of my life in terms of weeks, months, and years. As a result of that, I feel nothing from the hobbies or moments that would before provide me feelings of joy, satisfaction or just generally fulfilling myself. The only activities I really ""enjoy"" anymore is anything that provides me with a complete escape from reality, however these activities are not exactly one belonging to a healthy lifestyle. I just want to enjoy the things that I used to enjoy, but whenever I try I feel like I am wasting my time, are not doing them well enough. Has anybody gone through something similar, and has advice for how they managed to get through it? Thanks for reading.","I think the hardest thing for me, and the largest factor I need to address to try and feel healthy again, is simply trying to feel engaged in and enjoying the present."
"Thank You ArtChick and Tempesta , all of you who have been here for me. I am so glad that you all understand. I really want to get out from behind this trapped door. My life is so controlled and he does not even see it. He denies it when i bring it up. I cry because i cannot buy things for my children or grandchildren. This is not the way it is suppose to be. One of the reasons I do not make it to church on some Sundays is because I do not have clothes to wear. I have a pair of black jeans i keep switching jackets and shirts so i do not look the same every Sunday. My daughter bought me a nice dress and it was warm enough last Sunday to wear it. I guess i should not care about what people think and all the people at my church are wonderful, not judgmental. I do go to the Lord in Prayer every morning and study my Bible. I feel content because we are supposed to give all our worries to him and not get in his way of taking care of them. I know God is working in my life, my daughter finding this site is just one of the ways i know. my husband just got a job after being out of work for a year. I prayed for that too. He did not just get a job but he got a good job. I told him he did not get it on his own. I know I am going to get better eventually. Thank all of you for being here for me. I will keep all of you in my prayers too.","Thank You ArtChick and Tempesta , all of you who have been here for me.

"I suffer from major depression too and I have taken almost all of the SSRI is but the only one that really helped me was Lexapro. I took it for around 2 month is, then decided that I did not want to become addicted to another medication so I just stopped taking it and it did not bother me at all. I have been taking 100 mil of Elavil at bedtime which is also an antidepressant but I take it to help me sleep. It used to help control my depression but it does not anymore and really does not help me sleep either. Have you ever tried Lexapro? I think it is the best SSRI one can be on and I had no side effects while taking it so you might want to ask your doctor about it. If there is an alternative treatment for major depression I would like to know what it is. I really have no reason to be depressed as I have a very loving, supportive husband 4 wonderful children, 10 grandchildren and 6 great-grand children. Both my husband and I are retired and this is a time when I should really be enjoying my life but there is a void which I cannot explain. I do not want for anything. I have a beautiful home, a new Durango but the material things are not what makes one happy. I have been told that one chooses to be happy or unhappy but I certainly do not choose to be unhappy and I do not know anyone who would. I am a devout Christian and I know that my depression is not coming from God but I am letting the Devil tell me that I am depressed. Maybe God is just trying to bring me closer to Him and I need to lay my burden of depression at His feet and tell him that I cannot get through this alone, then just forget about it but for me it is not that easy. Three of my 4 children are taking antidepressants so I guess depression might be hereditary (spelling?). I will pray for you to feel better and will you please pray for me too? Thank you.","I suffer from major depression too and I have taken almost all of the SSRI is but the only one that really helped me was Lexapro.

"Older female fighting depression Hi I am a 54 year old female that is recently lost 100 pounds and quit smoking. You think that would solve the depression!

"I am new to this board. I have been on State Disability for severe depression since March. Sometime during the summer - cannot remember exactly when - I was sent for a psychiatric evaluation. Even though I told the doctor I was still suicidal, sleeping 18 hours or not at all, bulimic, and in danger of eviction because I could not manage running a household, she determined I was well enough to go back to work. I have been under psychiatric care for depression for about 12 years now. This is NOT going away. I have been trying to finish my Social Security application since March but it is too overwhelming. I should have it ready this week. Does anyone have any experience with appeals at the state (California) level? Btw, I did lose my apartment and had to send my son to live in Texas with my mother since I was on the verge of homelessness. I spend all day paralyzed with fear.

"Hello. I am just getting over a suicide attempt, my 2nd. It was extremely serious. I was planning it for week, and when I was fired form my job I did it the next day. I have a BS in chemistry and worked testing pharmacological products, so i knew what to take. I do not know what made me call my ex-BF. I did not speak to him for 4 months, but I wanted him to be the one to find me. Needless to say I lived. The doctors where surprised that I did. I took 3 things, (not going to give people ideas) that i knew they could not do anything for because of them being together. They could not pump my stomach cause of the one thing. They could not give any antidotes cause of interactions. I took well over the lethal limit. My life was spiraling out of control since Jan of 98. Since then, I have had 3 heart and 2 cancer operations. I was discharged from the Navy, was an officer, because of the medical stuff. My 1st suicide attempt was in the navy, they chalked it up to being stupid and not dealing with the 1st heart and cancer surgeries. My parents had a bitter divorce and I was caught in the middle when I got home. My mother assumed my ID and ran up a bunch of bills. I came out of the closet. I slept around to feel wanted. Which was not a wise choice, I gained my 3rd major medical situation. Not going to say what, but I am sure you can figure it out. I have a soul mate that I hurt, my ex-BF, and who knows if we will ever be friends or more. 2005 was a blur. I do not remember things, or saw things that where not there. Like documentation, which led to me being fired. I was afraid to leave the house, and was even afraid of 5 year olds selling candy for the school. The good thing about the suicide attempt is there was a proper diagnosis. I compartmentalized, and pushed emotions away. Every situation or moment had its own little box, and I put it away. I wanted to be like Spok or Data. I would put on different mask for different situations. There was shopping me, gas pumping me, heck, i had a separate mask for every action I performed. I have abandonment issues, from how i was treated growing up. Medicines did nothing and gave bad side effects. My depression is not chemical, but mental. I need to re-learn how to think and handle emotions and issues properly. Unemployment is running out, people are looking for money for bills. But it is better to be alive. WOW, this was longer than I intended. Just saying who I am, and I am a mess..but slowly putting my life together.","I took 3 things, (not going to give people ideas) that i knew they could not do anything for because of them being together.

"My best friend is husband shot himself friday night. I am angry. He was a manly man. All of us. All of his friends encouraged him to get help but he grew up in a world, in a house, that thought mental health professionals were quacks. He thought that taking medicine for something going on in your head was weak. This was an entirely medical problem that could have been prevented. So I am mad. At him for leaving my best friend a 26 year old widow, at the people who raised him, at society, for telling him it is weak to take medicine, at whatever the fuck higher power may be responsible for this stupid, senseless waste. I am guilty for not trying to do more. I am heartbroken that I will never talk to him again or hear him play his guitar or see him turn a piece of wood into something beautiful. I am confused by the events leading up to it. I just need help. I do not know what to do. I am spending most of my time with my best friend and trying to be strong and give comfort where I can.

"I had therapy today. I do not even know where to start. First off, I lost a day last week (time loss/dissociation)..it was last Tuesday that I lost. My mom called me Friday and I said ""why are you calling me"" and she said ""I always call you on Friday"". I told her that it was Thursday and she told me I was wrong. So, I back tracked the best I could and I cannot remember anything that I did on Tuesday. The interesting thing is that I mailed my therapist the research info I found on dissociation so when I saw her today I asked her what was the date that I put on the letter I sent and guess what..IT WAS TUESDAY. Then she asked me if I brought it in and I told her no that I mailed it. And she said that I could not have because it was not scanned by the post office. She showed me the envelope and it was not scanned at all. She also said that the mail had already come in the office and the envelope was in her mailbox way after she had already checked her mail. So, we have no idea how that got to her office. But I do not drive and Carol did not take me anywhere last week. So, if anyone remembers being with me or talking to me Tuesday..COULD YOU HELP ME OUT PLEASE. My therapist looked over the information that I sent her and she said that everything basically fits with what I am going through and DID. The problem is, she does not treat dissociative disorders and has no idea how to even help me. I appreciated her honesty though. But she said she knows a therapist in Jeffersonville, IN..oh God..that treats dissociative patients but I do not drive and Carol is not going to take me over to Jville on a weekly basis for therapy. Also, we have never even been over there before so we would get lost. So, she then called her boss and another lady to see if they knew who else in Louisville could help me and to see if she can get some help on treating me. I also gave her more info on some of the things I am dealing with and the voices that are going on. I even gave her the names of the two that I already know of. She said the fact that I cannot remember my childhood and that I not only lose time for minutes but also for days that it is not normal and we need to figure out how to help me. I have been in the mental health system since 2001 and have had just about every diagnosis slapped on me. I hope I can finally get some help. I am honestly about to give up. She also said that she is going to see if they can take me off the Seroquel since it is making me sick and NOT WORKING. So, she asked me what else I have been on and I told her (Haldol - did not work, Risperdal - did not work, Zyprexa - did not work, Paxil/Paxil CR - worked for a little bit then wore off, Wellbutrin - did not work). She said that she wants to try Depakote, Abilify, or another mood stabilizer. I also took those two journal entries in that I posted last week so she could read them. And, I wish I could get it scanned but it did not look right to me so I cannot show them to you (that is why I just typed it) and she said that one of the interesting things that stood out about the entries is that the handwriting was different in three places. I am a mess. But believe it or not, after today is session I am a little hopeful. In other news, Carol and I have started working on our book of poetry. We have been throwing around ideas all day and working out some details. We are in the process of getting the poems we want to be in the book together and coming up with a title (which we have already done). We are also working on the different categories that we want the poems to fall under. I have been working around with PagePlus for a couple of hours now trying to figure out how we can set this up. She also has a list of publishers that we are going to be going through as well. I am also still working on getting around to doing some updates on my webpage and trying to budget out how I can pay for my site so I can get more space and get rid of those damn banner ads. I am moving as fast as I can but right now I am having some sinus issues (again).","First off, I lost a day last week (time loss/dissociation)..it was last Tuesday that I lost.

"I take it that by you saying ""Learn to give rather than take and you will find life turns around!"" that you are implying that I am a taker and not a giver. And maybe that is so. Maybe all the blood that I have donated (it gives me a sense of purpose and sometimes it seems that the nurses there are the only ones who care that I am alive, and that is only because of what my body produces) or the times when I do things out of the kindness of my heart rather than for monetary gains or as a means to earn someone is favor or to make them somehow indebted to me like others would do, maybe doing all that still means that I am a taker.

And by that age most guys have been in at least one relationship. I have not. That is why I have set the timeframe. Everyone I know has had at least a taste of love and human companionship by the time they were 30. So I have decided that if no one wants me, why stay? Living alone means seeing what I want on TV..and having absolutely no one to enjoy or discuss it with. That is my view of it. Pessimistic? Yes, but it is been the truth for me. I am sorry to sound bitter, but this is exactly what I face out in the world. People see my problems and think that it is my fault.

"Okay, here is the deal. I am 17, and I have been depressed and suicidal for as long as i can remember. (See the post ""God Hates Me"") I just want to die. I hate living. It feels like no one cares. In order to combat my depression I write. To date I have written four major writings (50,00- 200 pages - words or more) and am on my fifth. Last year, when I was on my first major writing one of my friends asked me if she could read it. I was hesitant because it is my soul. I take everything I feel and put it down on the page. It is all I do. i do not go out or have any kind of social life. Writing is my life. But, I eventually let her read it. She liked it and read that whole writing. Since then she has become my editor of sorts. There is just one problem - she is not editing. You see, she is a drama geek - in plays and everything - and does not have a whole lot of free time so I understand a slow pace, but lately I have had to prod her to do anything. Even over Christmas break she did not do anything. Now, I have to call her on the weekends (which is the only time she will even do it now) to get her to do anything. If I do not she will forget she even has it. Every time I ask her about it, she just tells me how busy she is and I end up feeling guilty. I feel like she is rejecting me as a person, like she is saying ""i just do not care about you."" It hurts me so bad. It makes me feel like the one thing keeping me alive is stupid.

I want her to do it, but I do not want it to seem like i am pestering her. I understand she is busy, but she makes time to go out with her other friends. Could not she make a little time for me?

There are those who might really care about you and want to help but they have zero clue how depression works and their mindset is basically to tell you to get over it because that is what they do. It is so fucking shit. I should be grateful I have people that care about me I know, but its genuinely not that helpful when they brush aside how shit I really feel because they do not see a reason for me to feel like this other than just being weak. It is not even their fault it is just actually uncomprehendable to some people that you would rather not exist sometimes for reasons beyond your control.

At one point i even stopped contacting people around me because i was like ""talk is ok but no talk is ok too"" , and even today i still feel that way . I still feel joy and moods in life , like eating good food , cry from very sob movies , but at the end of the day there is always something , it is not feeling the same like how i had felt my entire life . I think it might be because i have no dreams or passions like other folks in my life , but i was always like that and i was always fully content with it .

"Getting motivated to get help I was diagnosed with a mood disorder and PTSD ~1.5 years ago. I was getting help for a while but I dropped out of school and moved out of state so I just have not been able to do that in the past year. I live with (and mooch off of) an SO but I have been fairly isolated for about 6 months. I have been doing online school but had to drop my classes this semester when I started working. Now all I do is this stupid part-time job. I should probably quit because it makes me incredibly suicidal. It is all so superficial. It does not feel beneath me but I really just do not mesh with it. Anyway. Health insurance. I cannot figure out how to fill out the income stuff. A hospital near me has people that can help but I just cannot find the motivation to even call them. It is like I am trying to prevent myself from getting help. It is not even just psychiatric reasons that I want health insurance. I have a referral for a neurologist. I have been having memory issues, twitches, etc. I know I will not go without insurance. I probably could stand to get on birth control and check out some other persistent problems too but a) I know I will not be taken seriously and b) the only thing I genuinely like about myself is my mind so that is the priority. I am not completely not trying. I will take St. John is Wort if I am persistently suicidal but it does not help with motivation. I have been going to support groups. I will ""decide"" to be motivated but end up collapsed and sobbing before I get out of the door. Play music, leave my phone behind so I do not get sidetracked. Tell people what I am doing so I feel pressured to keep my word. Incentivize with promises of fast food, caffeine, or chocolate. I dunno what else to do. I cannot even tell if it is laziness or depression or something else. The only thing that motivates me to go to work is fear which is also the main thing that prevents me from quitting.","Getting motivated to get help I was diagnosed with a mood disorder and PTSD ~1.5 years ago.

"Try to stop identifying with your thoughts Dude, I know how it is to be depressed. I know how it is to be sick and tired of being sick and tired. Tired of the hate, tired of being tired of the hate, tired of being tried of being affected by the hate.

What do you got to lose? Check out Eckhart Tolle or Noah Elkrief on youtube.","Try to stop identifying with your thoughts Dude, I know how it is to be depressed.

"A Letter to My Future Self: Self Love Dear (future) B, This letter may be fragmented. This letter may be short, or it may be long. This letter may be emotional. Most importantly, this letter is to show you that you can stay grounded despite the rush of emotions you experience when you feel vulnerable and [falsely] unloved. Everything you thought you knew since that day (October 21st) has become unraveled within the last fourteen hours. It is hard to find the words that can sum it all up in order to save some time and space within this letter. This letter is also not about those specific events but about you and only you, and how far you have come; it all plays into being able to deal with whatever the future may bring. As you admitted this morning, to yourself and G, your sense of clarity evaporates when you begin to feel vulnerable. It leads you to a self-fulfilling prophecy - the exact neediness you exhibit will do the exact opposite of what you would like it to do and will therefore lead you to feeling ever more needy. Listen to me: You are not validated by someone is ability (or lack thereof) to love you. And again: Sometimes, it is not simply not about you. So far in your healing process you have managed to understand the importance of detachment. You are making wonderful progress and I hope that at some point you are still progressing. Your existence is for you and for you only. It is not okay or healthy to live solely for another human being. Remember that you are not incomplete without someone however that someone can enhance the you that you already are. A relationship consists of two people working together as a whole yet existing as their own sense of wholeness outside of the relationship. That is so very important for you to remember for the rest of your life. Remember when you felt vulnerable just a few weeks ago (sometime in November) and wanted to dive into texting that boy in order to make you feel better about yourself? And then remember that you did not because you kept your clarity and understood that it was a coping mechanism. Do not forget that you have done that not only once but a few times now and that is exceptional. I understand future Bri may encounter some setbacks and that her well-being might as well be a roulette wheel, but that is exactly what this letter is for. As you have been told, you are luminous. You shine bright. Your heart is [almost too] huge. You have the potential to do great things. You are not your illness and you are not your insecurities. The grave you will lay in one day will only consist of you and nobody else. If the world ends and you survive, you have yourself. You have to keep this mind every single day. Work on self love and understand your worth. Yes, G makes you feel like the most important girl in the world. But before you can let him do that, you need to understand that you are the most important girl in the world to yourself, for yourself. You are done putting your interests aside just to receive love for the night/day. You are done with getting angry at the phone for not getting responses quickly. You are done feeling unimportant or unloved because you are not someone is first priority. In the month and a half since the breakup, you have transformed. It is only the beginning but you have taken steps in the right direction. Future B needs to look back on this whether she is in a good spot at the time or not. She needs to know that even though she may not be at a point in life she envisioned, she did something for herself. When you feel like he is pulling away, do not push harder. When you feel like you want to run to him in order to silence your overwhelmingly surfacing insecurities, understand that will not make things better. Understand that they are amplified and you are only expressing coping mechanisms in order to deal with the underlying issue. The issue is not that he does not love you but that you make yourself unloveable. Understand that when you get into that mindset and lose grasp of the clarity, someone moving mountains for you will not fill that hole of pain. The only person on the face of this Earth that can fill that hole is you. You have the capability of moving mountains on your own when you remember these things. Continue doing your research. Continue taking time for yourself. Continue setting your phone down for hours at a time. Continue living your life out and letting others play a part and not the center role. You are the star of your life, you lead the show. Your family, friends, boyfriend, colleagues - they play their roles in your story. Most importantly, they play their lead role in their own stories and similarly you are character. Learn to appreciate silence. Learn to appreciate a bit of loneliness and solitude. Self-love includes coming home from work to take a hot bath and drink a glass of red wine, not rushing over to whoevers house in order to feel loved by someone else. You cannot be loved appropriately if you cannot love yourself first. Is not it just like me to start taking the advice I have been given by so many people my entire life. Love yourself. Respect yourself. Appreciate your own time. Respect others. Respect other is need for space. Live for you. Again, love yourself. With love, B, 12/3/2017.","A Letter to My Future Self: Self Love Dear (future) B, This letter may be fragmented.

"I kinda like being depressed after dealing with anxiety As a lot of people, I have both depression and anxiety disorders. Basically a thing happened in July, which caused me to have constant panic attacks and overall brutal anxiety until around October, when I just transitioned into deep depression. It was however a big relief. I was completely empty, I did not care about anything. It was 100x better to me than fucking anxiety. When I am depressed, I do not feel 'bad'. I do not feel good either, but I am fine with that. I do not feel anything, it is kinda relaxing. The downside - when I was in the deepest state of depression I was really close to killing myself and I also threatened to shoot up the school, after which police took me to a mental hospital. I have been here for over 3 months now. I did some really bad things, I acted really bad, but on the inside I felt better. When I am anxious I do not do mean things to people, but on the inside I am dying, I feel vulnerable and just want help. I understand that depression is awful and people suffer from it, I see what it does to people on this sub. I just wanted to add my experience, since it is different to everyone else is. Anxiety makes me feel like I am having a heart attack, like I am going crazy, I sweat, I shake, it feels literally like torture. Depression is the exact opposite. It is calmness, not giving a shit about anything, basically relaxing. I feel kinda comfortable being depressed. I lie on the bed and look at the ceiling, at the wall, whatever. Like I am on autopilot. Right now I have both, which just feels fucking weird, I cannot even describe that. Sorry if I offended anyone. I know some people prefer to feel something, but I am fine with being an empty shell. tlr - depression &gt; anxiety for me.","I kinda like being depressed after dealing with anxiety As a lot of people, I have both depression and anxiety disorders.

"Random girl asked me awful question today. I am not sure if this is the right place to post this or not, but I need to get this off my chest. I have struggled with depression for about 3 years now and I have had my highs and my lows. Recently I have been doing okay even though me and my girlfriend mutually broke up, but we are still friends and she supports me. And my birthday is coming up soon so I was looking forward to that. Today though I decided to go to subway to get a melt and I was just standing in line when this girl walks away from her friend and up to me. I thought she was pretty and was nervous about why she was talking to me until she asked Are you a serial killer? That is when my heart sank. I had just shaved and I realize I am not the best looking guy in the world, but I did not know that is how strangers perceived me. I kept a calm demeanor until I got back to my car and I just complete broke down and I was bawling all the way home. I do not know why it hurt so much, but I felt like complete shit. I am trying to not let it affect me and not hit a low point so I hope sharing this relieves me a little bit. I am nervous about sharing this though. I am just shocked that someone could say that. Sorry for the formatting I am on mobile. I do not know if this is the right sub for this either, I just needed to get this off my chest.","Random girl asked me awful question today.

I am tired of spending every weekend crying. It did not used to be this bad. I was fine being alone and forgotten. I do not know what changed though. I guess it all just caught up to me. I have felt depressed for as long as I can remember but I was always able to handle it. I am really losing it lately though. Last year was bad. This year is already worse. I am too much of a quitter to make things better. I do not even know why I am posting this. I guess I just want someone to know I was hear.,"Last year was bad.

"Hello, I am Yevgenny, 21 years old, and have suffered from depression for..well..I guess as long as I can remember. I started having suicidal thoughts when I was 9, but strangely enough, I cannot remember having at that age any concept of suicide. I have been placed on practically all of the antidepressants over the years (with the exception of MAOIs), and am currently taking Cymbalta--no real side effects, seems effective enough. My father died when I was 18, but that in itself was not so sad. Last September, I had a sudden thought regarding my feelings about his death, and I found the most heartbreaking aspect was, like I said, not the fact that he died, but that the process of dying was for him degrading and humiliating. Like me, he was very independent--if he needed help with something, he considered himself defeated; he was content in his own world, like I am, but the magnitude of something like death forced people into his world..those intangible connections between ourselves and others, between him and others, seemed to chain him down. When I had my last breakdown in September, I could not stop myself from imagining it; to find yourself suddenly and wholly dependent on others, and for them to force themselves into your mind, your world, and find for themselves some memory or happy relic to take with them such that even your most private, perhaps sacred thoughts and memories are wrenched from you. I thought about what it must have been like to know with certainty that death was all that was left, the helplessness of not being able to face your own future without someone either doing it for you or having earlier robbed you of the existential will power to do it. I attempted to hang myself after my morning classes. I am not sure how, but before kicking the chair away, I forced myself to call someone because the world is so huge, and I have only had the chance to see such a small part of it, to die then, would have been so meaningless and empty--the very things I was attempting to escape, meaninglessness and emptiness. The friend I called left work immediately and came to me. She cried in one afternoon more than I ever have, and she was not even the depressed one. So, fast forward to today. Did some inpatient care. I am seeing a therapist whom I trust, respect, and have thus far been unable to outwit (it is a good thing.) On a physiological basis, the medication is helping. Psychologically however, I have got some work to do. Ignoring biological/chemical factors, in order for me to be happy, I need to find/build/understand the meaning of my life. I do not believe that man is born with an inherent raison d'etre, or that one is given to him by some divine entity; rather, I believe that the meaning of one is life is self-constructed and in continual flux, it is something you work on, something you subsist upon, and yet is something that is always just out of reach, or one brush stroke undone. Not an easy job. But last week I was on my front porch at around 4pm having a cigarette (I am keeping this habit for now.) Everything was still, the air still cold with winter but with traces of spring on every tree, the clouds were lit from below and the west, it was like a painting; but it was this oddly static scene that gave me the most lucid understanding of myself, that unstoppable, dynamic thing we call self. And so, more than ever before, I am going to take treatment seriously and honestly; even if there is sadness, those chance moments of serenity that make up for in intensity what they lack in length, in those instances I think I will find meaning, no, I already have, I suppose. I apologize for how lengthy this became, but I am guessing it was somehow necessary for me to say. I am looking forward to talking with the other members of the forum, as I do not think I have ever talked to others who were depressed. Even if I do not find much help here, there might be someone who finds such help in me. Thanks! And, again, I will try to keep future posts shorter, but in my defense, sometimes when I write I do not feel in control..oh, starting to go off again. Ok, I am going to stop now.","Hello, I am Yevgenny, 21 years old, and have suffered from depression for..well..I guess as long as I can remember.

"Honestly, i do not know if it is worth it anymore. I wake up, there is only fucking trouble and chaos around me, all of my family members are suffering from anxiety and depression, things only look worse by the day. My dad told us how he does not care if he dies tomorrow on christmas eve.. i do not know, maybe this post is coming out as confusing or chaotic but the reality is.. I do not know if it is worth holding it or living anymore, i am not suicidal but i need to fucking vent, 'cause i am fucking going crazy, i cant fucking sleep at night, and when i do, i feel fucking sad the whole fucking day. I fucking hate myself. All this shit because we cannot fucking return home, and we are here because is ny fucking fault. Fuck this shit. And every fucking time im around people i just dont know why i put on this fucking mask, a fucking emotional mask, i pretend like im happy and im having fun when really im fucking dying on the inside, im tired, im fucking tired of living, im tired of money, im tired of problems, the only thing i want right now is a pack of cigs and absolute silence and peace.

"Officially by myself. Texted my ex who is the only one who knows about my depression and suicidal thoughts, told her i fear i might not make it till next week. Since she is at this big end of the school year party she told me not to talk to her about this as she does not want her night ruined, and then literally told me to 'go see a psychologist'. Ca not believe the only person i have ever trusted in enough to let her know about my condition just let go of me like that.

Rant; for the last 10 years my dad has had cancer, hes not well at all. It seems im the only one who gives enough of a shit to help him. I wouldve moved away and had a life by now, but ive stayed purely for him. Last week i realised hes manipulating me to get anything he fucking wants. The girl ive been chasing for 6 months that i fell in love with has just fucked me off. Long story short about 3 months ago she had a 2 year anniversary with a guy but admitted she has a thing for me. So i waited it out and about 3 weeks ago they broke up so i thought 'hey, ill see if i can hang out with her and see what happens' nope. Told her i still feel how i did and she just says 'i see you as a friend and nothing more'. Maybe im just not cut out to be here, or to deal with people?

"I do not feel well. Hey, I am a highschool freshman and this has been the lowest I have ever been from the past three years of feeling like I should be gone. Buckle up your seatbelts because this will probably be pretty long. Since the beginning of this year, I have been wanting to die; I feel so lonely and as if nobody actually cares about me. So, there is my primary friendship group; the people I hang out with the most. All of my (2) ""genuine"" female friends pretty much do not give two shits about me because I tend to act really clingy to them and other people because I have been friends with them since first grade and do not want to lose them. One of my female friends is kinda popular and she barely talks to me, and I just feel like I am undeserving of her time or something; she is also kinda claimed my other female friend, so I do not get as much time to hang out with them as I used to. My guy friends are also a bit popular and they also happen to be dating my two female friends lol. They do make me feel happy talking to them, and I do hang out with them a lot, but sometimes I feel like I should not be hanging out with them all that much because then I am ""stealing"" them from my friends. I also get pretty bummed not being in a relationship when my other friends are, and I do feel like I am not needed amongst any of my friends. (Basically, I just feel like the rebound when one of my friends are not there). Can we actually talk about one of my female friends a bit more, actually? We will call her M and my other female friend B. We met M last year and we invited her to hang out with us during our lunches. M was going through a tough time and we helped her out all the time and it was great making a new really close friend. She was really fun to talk to, but I do not know..sometimes she says some shit to me that makes me kinda bummed. I remember telling her how I felt kinda depressed once, and she said something along the lines of ""Stop asking for attention and actually do something"". Another time, I was hanging out with B is boyfriend, but the next day, M was mad at me and told me I should not take him from B (which I do get and feel bad for, but B is totally cool with it and understands how me and her boyfriend hang out Recently, (I do not remember what initiated the conversation really) M and I were talking (which rarely happens anymore), and she was talking about how she feels like she does not have anyone that actually cares for her, when she has so many people that clearly do care about her and love her. Then she proceeds to tell me to actually go and make friends again. I hate being petty and talking about other people, but I just do not feel comfortable being very close to her anymore and I am not sure she is interested in talking to me either. So then that leaves like two male friends, and again because they are in relationships with B and M, I am trying to pace myself with hanging out with them so one of them do not get upset. It is also pretty hard to make friends in a school where most people are white and really attractive, or already have their place. I am a non-attractive Asian female that tends to make weird jokes and seem really masculine with the way that I mainly put forward, and I just do not fit in anywhere. I have a lot of anxiety of what people think of me, so then I sometimes struggle with talking to people. I would not say people dislike me at all, it is just that nobody would hang out with me outside of school and it is hard to find people that are willing to spend time with me. There is also the problem with others' expectations of me;; Almost all my life, I have been deemed ""smart"", which has caused so much pressure and anxiety throughout the years. My parents really want me to do well in school, and peers think I am so great at everything. I *thought* it would go away after elementary school, but even here, people consider me being so ""smart"" and able to do anything. With currently a ~95 average in my classes, it is extremely difficult to maintain that and I feel like if I do any worse, someone is going to get mad at me. People expect me and think I am so good, but really I am just average at literally everything I do. I also have no idea what I want to do with my life. I am not very good at anything, and I have so many interests, it is hard to pin down something that I *should* do with my time. Nothing really interests me enough to do it for like 25~40 years of my life, and the things I would be interested in have literally no way of making a living off of or is something totally unachievable. I feel like I cannot make any difference to anyone in the world, and I will die not making an impression on anyone or having anyone really care about me in the end. I have been hurting myself since about third grade, mostly from scratching myself with my nails until it leaves a mark for a few days and hitting myself on the back of the head. It is extremely satisfying and I feel like it is a good thing to punish myself for being such a waste. So that is pretty much the gist of it, I guess? Mostly just problems with self worth and having others view me a certain way. There is some other stuff, but nothing that I can really think of at the top of my head. These past 3 months have been excruciating, and I have not gone a day without thinking I should just end it all and give up. I want to be happy, but that just seems so far away and I do not know if me living benefits anyone. Admittedly, I do not want to die, but I *do* at the same time? I feel like I have no place in the world and I cannot talk to anyone about how I am feeling because none of them are actually willing to hear what I have to say, so now I am just dumping my feelings on Reddit. I am tired of living and feeling like shit. I do not remember the last time I genuinely felt happy to be alive. I want someone I am close to tell me that they love me and care about me and say I am not a useless piece of garbage and that what I say is not meaningless or invalid. I do not want to feel alone. I do not ask to feel alone. I feel alone because I am alone, and I feel like I cannot tell anyone this because I do not want them to walk out of my life. I am sorry if this seemed really petty and like I am just bitching about some shitty first world problems, because I know I am. I just feel kinda down right now and I have not been able to tell someone how I actually feel in months. So yeah. Thanks for reading, stranger. Sorry for the inconvenient text wall.","All of my (2) ""genuine"" female friends pretty much do not give two shits about me because I tend to act really clingy to them and other people because I have been friends with them since first grade and do not want to lose them.

"Does anyone else miss the person they used to be? I have always struggled with depression, but sometimes it is more manageable than other times. I have noticed that with every new year and myself getting older, I begin to look back on my past and long for it, even sometimes breaking down because I miss the person I used to be. I am 23, so still young, but I really wish I could go back and be 19/20 again because that was when I was truly happy. I had moved out of my hometown, had lots of friends, a good relationship, I lost tons of weight and was confident for the first time ever, I traveled and worked for fun instead of working as a means of survival. I loved life, I had so much energy and such a bright outlook on everything and I had a lot of fun. Now, that is all over. I really only have one good friend left from those times and he does not even live near me anymore; sometimes I get really down when I think about old friends and start thinking about things I could have said differently that might have prevented the arguments we had that would eventually lead to the end of our friendship, I really never knew how much I needed them until they no longer wanted me in their lives. My relationship fizzled out in the same way and I have yet to develop a connection like that with anyone again. I have also gained all my weight back and cannot stand to look at my own reflection. I do not know how to be happy like I was again. I look at old pictures from times past with old friends, destinations I went too and I want to cry because I just wish I could go back. I am so depressed and hate myself, I am incredibly lonely and am just a shell of the person I used to be. It is like I am mourning my past life or something.","I had moved out of my hometown, had lots of friends, a good relationship, I lost tons of weight and was confident for the first time ever, I traveled and worked for fun instead of working as a means of survival.

"I made a word cloud of all my depressive posts over the past three years. This is based on all the posts on my throwaway account (this is my main account and has too many unrelated posts to sort through) since 2014. I think it is noteworthy that some of the biggest words in the cloud are negative. While going back over these posts from so relatively long ago, I noticed that most of the older ones seemed like they were written by a total stranger. If it were somebody else saying those things about me, it would be called harassment, but it was me saying those things about myself. All in all, this has really made me realize that all the things I have written about myself are way off-base, and are only true in my mind during a depressive episode. I know something is wrong, but I do not know what to do about it. In some ways I am sure I will always think this way about myself, regardless of what I do, but I wish there were an easy way to manage it. I used [this]() word cloud generator. Cheers.","I made a word cloud of all my depressive posts over the past three years.

My father says he just turned his head for a while and she was gone. I have been searching for her all day. Feeling hopeless, lonely and useless. I should not have left the house yesterday.

"What is the point in living? Obviously with the title you would think I am sad and hate myself or am severely suicidal. In reality, there is truth to that, but I seriously do not see a point in living. I have tried different things to try and discover myself like spending 1500 dollars on camera equipment thinking maybe photography is my calling only to return it the next week. I have bought a jeep thinking maybe overlanding or off-roading is my thing and now I am in the process of selling it. I have 1 friend that I hang out with once a month. I have 2 real life friends that I text occasionally. I have not had a girlfriend in several years now. Mind you I turn 20 years old tomorrow. I do not know what the next step in my life is? Who am I? Is there something more to me than just working then going home just to sleep all day? I have had a small problem with taking pain killers like oxy, vicodin, and codeine. I just do not find any joy in any part of my life. I do not want to die, but at the same time I would not mind not waking up tomorrow. I just want a passion. Something to live for. I do not want to be like this, but I have tried different things all my life and I have lost all joy. Is there a way to discover myself? Is that even an actual thing? What am I missing in my life? I just want to look forward to living another day rather than dreading it. To clarify, I do not consider myself suicidal. I do not WANT to die.

"I cannot seem to be happy with my current life - only the future So I was diagnosed with mood swings/mild depression quite a while ago, and have been on a small dose of Fluoxetine (Prozac) most of my life now. Based on looking at objective measures, I should be feeling pretty content right now, but I cannot seem to be happy about it, and only about the things that I hope I will work towards in the future. I guess for example - I have lost a little over 30 pounds since February, the first significant time I have actually lost weight, and I am now no longer medically obese.. but I still just feel fat and have not been able to feel anything good about the weight I have actually lost. I have a great job, and am just about to finish paying off all my loans, but I do not feel any accomplishment in that either. I keep thinking maybe I will feel good when I have enough to put down a down-payment on a house, but I doubt that will be the case. I have a bunch of great friends, but I am tired of being single again. I know that I should just focus on the good things right now, but it is not seeming to be any consolation. My faith life has been doing pretty good recently too, especially compared to the past, but I still feel like a shitty person a lot. I dunno, I know that so many other people are having a rough time and I should be happy with how things are going, but I am just down right now.","Based on looking at objective measures, I should be feeling pretty content right now, but I cannot seem to be happy about it, and only about the things that I hope I will work towards in the future.

"Coming to terms with life long depression It is always going to be there in my life, like a dark cloud creeping in on a sunny day, and I am okay with that. After 7 long years of battling depression and going through the highs and lows that come with it and after dedicating myself to therapy, medication and lifestyle changes I have finally accepted that I am going to have to learn to live with depression for the rest of my life.

"Psychiatrist of 6 years terminated me as a patient and is refusing refills of Lamictal because I went to outpatient rehab? I have been going to the same psychiatrist for 6 years. I have been on a high dose of Lamictal for 6 years to treat bipolar disorder. I have gone to regular appointments and have had consistent refills. I had a period of intense depression in which I went on a one month drinking binge and went to a hospital where I was given Ativan to deal with the withdrawal. It was not a consistent prescription, just enough pills to ween off the withdrawal and ensure I would not relapse back to drinking. My psychiatrist just called me and told me she is terminating me as a patient and is unable to see me or refill my lamictal because I was prescribed Ativan by another physician. I am freaking out about the effects of stopping this cold turkey. I only took the Ativan for one week, two months ago. I just want to have my lamictal refilled. I need a refill this week, I cannot find a new psychiatrist in time. How is this allowed? I sought emergency treatment for a substance abuse issue and am being unsafely yanked off a medicine I have been on my entire adult life.

"Hi all, I am in hell of major depression. After being for over 8 years on Elavil and Valium(small dosage), with good results for most of the time, I tapered down because of the side effects and have been drug free for 1 year. During this year the depression slowly settled in making my life unbearable lately. I do not know what to do. I saw 2 psychiatrists within last month. One of them wanted me on Paxil and the second one on Effexor. Problem is I am so afraid of side effects that I cannot begin taking any of them, meantime my life is falling to pieces. My nervous system was completely messed up by these medicines. I had severe fasciculation of muscles for over 4 months after being medicine free (sign of tardive dyskinesia, untreatable neurological condition) and get them back whenever I try any supplement that would increase serotonin level (SAMe, St. John is Wort, Rhodiola). My memory got better after I stopped the medication but now it is falling apart because of the depression I get de-realized I mean if depression will not kill me these medicines will. What are my alternatives (if any)? Shall I take these medicines, for the time being, endure side effects and expose myself to degenerative damage? Shall I stay away from medicines and get incapacitated by depression? Is there any alternative treatment for major depression? I would appreciate any advice. Dania","My memory got better after I stopped the medication but now it is falling apart because of the depression I get de-realized I mean if depression will not kill me these medicines will.

"""I do not wanna die, but I ai not keen on livin' either."" Sorry for the Robbie lyric. I just want to vocalize a bit before the rare fancy passes and I go back to soldiering on alone. I am sorry if this rambles or does not quite make sense, but if I leave the stream of consciousness or reread I will probably delete because I loathe the idea of complaining to others or whinging knowing full well I have probably got it better than most people here. But a part of me wants to know that someone else experiences depression the same way, as some small solace. I am never particularly sad, nor do I hate or wish harm upon myself or my life or the people in it. However, in every waking moment I have a weight emanating from my core, like a gravitational pull sucking in my ability to want anything meaningful. The best way I can put it is in the title - I simply do not want to *be*. And that is not because I am overwhelmed by hardship or struggle, I have got it pretty good and there is nowhere I would rather be. If, hypothetically, you took me back to before my birth and laid out an incredible life for me and said ""alright, you are about to be born, ready to go?"" I would say ""no thanks, I am good"". With a core belief like that there is no life to live. Career advancement serves no purpose but to consume more time, and I would be taking a good job from someone who actually gets some personal value out of it. Romance is off the cards because someone who wants to date someone who does not want anything from life, probably also is not worth being with. And heaven forbid someone should want kids! Hey Junior, daddy does not like his existence but he had you anyway, what an asshole. I should stop before I become some combination of ""old man yells at cloud"" and ""whiny emo stereotype"". This stuff sits on me every day and I wish the small part of me that wants the affirmation of others was not there. But it is, so here I am.","But a part of me wants to know that someone else experiences depression the same way, as some small solace.

"Hey reddit, give me one moment. Take a deep breath. Release yourself of your roles and see yourself as a person dealing with other people. Take a moment right now, take a deep breath and appreciate how there is so much effort taken in making the world as it is. We harnessed the elements and made the surface of the world a little more enjoyable. Sit back and enjoy all this hard work. Strip the world off from labels. People do not mean to be good or bad. Remember that after you acomplish (or not) all your goals we are still people living with other people. Remember today. Take another deep breath, if you are comfortable, close your eyes. Appreciate whats around you, good or bad. Maybe the day is really ugly. Remember again that it is on around its own business. Do not see it about yourself, but instead look at your role in the big picture. Have a smile. You deserve it","Take a deep breath.

"Dead Mom, Schizophrenic Father. I wrote a 1,900 page message but I figured no one would read it. My mother committed suicide because I left home after years of neglect and emotional abuse. I could not go to my father because he has severe schizophrenia and it is not safe to be around him. I moved across country after my sister who had left a year prior convinced me to do. After I moved across country my sister gave me 2 weeks to get an apartment or she would kick me out. I got a job and an apartment (with the help of a really shitty roommate) and I had been working practically trying to just ignoring my previous life. A week ago I found out my mother had killed herself and now me and my sister are back to our old home trying to fix all the problems created by her unexpected (I honestly expected it) death. I have left all details out because I could fill a fucking book with them but the main point of this post is, I have been fighting all my life for a better life but things always seem to get worse and worse. I am at the point where I feel like joining my mother. You can only fight for so long before you have run out of energy.","Dead Mom, Schizophrenic Father.

"Little sister has depression, what do I do? As the title says my baby sister has depression and I heard from my boyfriend this subreddit gives him support. I just discover the past summer that my little sister (14) has depression and is now cutting her self with razor blades. I warned my mother that I read her diary and she was counting calories first in September. Earlier this week I told her to keep an eye on her cause I think she is depressed, btw I live in another continent at home and thus have limited access on how much I see them. My mom said she will keep an eye to see if she is cutting herself or not. We recently discovered that she does in deed and her circle of friends have depression too. She is being bullied as well by one guy at school and confidant has depression and is cutting himself as well. She opened up to my parents and one of close friends who is a professional who works with children a lot, is not a psychologist. My mom is very supportive as well as the rest of my family and we just want to help my little sister. My mom is not sure what to do, and neither am I. I suggested to look for professional help for her, as she is harming herself. However, we are not sure what to do about her surroundings. Most of her friends have depression and she is doing badly in school on top of that she is being bullied. What do you guys think? Change her of school and remove her from the toxic environment or leave her there and get her a psychologist?","Little sister has depression, what do I do?

I told her months ago that I was not sure if I could still be in a relationship with her anymore. She really needed a therapist so I really encouraged her to go. I think she may have only gone in an effort to save our marriage rather than herself. She is gotten new meds and this has happened over about 6mo. Last night I found a long search history of methods of suicide and I found a suicide note post dated a month from now. She is giving enough time to prepare everything. I am not sure what to do.

"Im a mess and I need to rant. Every so often, I will find a glimmer of hope and try my hardest to change my life. I will start exercising and eating healthy, and pushing myself to talk to people, and I will actually feel pretty good for a few days. Then I just stop. I will wake up one day and and have absolutely no desire to be healthy anymore and slip right back into feeling like shit and hating myself because I cannot commit to the simplest of things. This is probably the fourth time it is happened in the past year. I made some really bad choices today regarding food, which made me feel so much worse because in my eyes, my worth as a human being is directly tied to the shape of my body. Nobody could ever convince me that it is not. This past bought of motivation, I tried to convince myself that I was going to exercise and eat right for the sake of my health, but in the back of my mind, I knew the only real reason was because I wanted to lose weight. And now here I am, completely abandoned diet and exercise and right back into the throws of depression. All I want to do anymore is lay in bed and try to fall asleep. I do not have a job (or the desire to have one) and I lost most of my friends because I never talked to them. I live with my mom who I thought I could talk to about anything, but I feel like I cannot tell her about how bad it is gotten. It does not help that she tells me everyday that I need to get a job. I know she is right, but it makes me feel like an even bigger piece of garbage because I have never held down a job for more than 4 months. If I got a job right now, I would probably have a breakdown and quit the first week. I went through cosmetology school and put myself into debt just to wind up hating the field and trying to lie to myself that I did not. I thought it was all about doing hair, but it turns out it is all about trying to get people to buy some shitty hair product. I know my outlook on the world is fucked up, but I do not know how to change myself. It is like all these negative thoughts are engraved in the back of my skull. I just feel like I am stuck and any move I make is the wrong one. Sorry this is all over the place, I am just really deep into it right now and needed to vent.","I will wake up one day and and have absolutely no desire to be healthy anymore and slip right back into feeling like shit and hating myself because I cannot commit to the simplest of things.
