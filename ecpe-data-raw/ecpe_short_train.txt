2,null,null,I have been feeling bad for about 7 months now .
3,depressed,extreme sadness,There are periods where I cry on a daily basis , I never feel like talking , I struggle concentrating and collecting thoughts , I feel such an extreme sadness inside of me also in happy situations , I am exhausted all the time even if I sleep 10 hours straight
4,null,null,I often have headaches , I am completely alone
5,null,null,and I find it difficult to do anything .
6,null,null,There are nights where it is unbearable .
7,null,null,I think about my situation : I am completely alone , I am failing at anything because I am so weak I can not handle my feelings
8,null,null,, I feel guilt for everything that happens around me , I can not carry on anymore , I am always here in this dark place and
9,null,null,I feel that I have no right to be like this .
10,null,null,I used to self harm and
11,null,null,I still have many scars on my skin , but I think to be disrespectful to those who truly struggle
12,null,null,then I promised to cut never again .
13,null,null,I should not have the right to do so .
14,null,null,My life is void , I am void , and
15,null,null,I can not get the energy to do anything ever .
16,null,null,I do not get pleasure from what I used to love , nothing seems to make me feel something good .

21,null,null,Is it possible to fake depression ?

4,null,null,guess what
5,null,null,My brain decided this : Instead of sleeping , why do not you become half crazy , thinking about your future ( should I say the " lack " of future ? ) .
6,null,null,Here , have some cravings for cigarettes , my pleasure , and
7,null,null,of course i know you do not have cigarettes , do you think I am stupid ?

23,null,null,Selling pastries .

 (22, 23),(22, 28),(22, 50),
1,null,null,I was just curious what your feelings are on long - term outcomes for depression .
2,null,null,A little background for me
3,null,null,: I have been on and off medicines for several years .
4,null,null,I was always depressed as a child , but .
5,null,null,did not really seek professional help until maybe 10 years ago
6,null,null,I originally went on medicines .
7,null,null,for severe pms prescribed to me by my ob - gyn .
8,null,null,I just kind of continued on with it because it made me feel " leveled out " .
9,null,null,Then I had issues with sleep apnea , joint pains etc .
10,null,null,My neurologist put me on Effexor .
11,null,null,Every time I tried to go off that drug
12,null,null,I was dizzy and .
13,null,null,had bad side effects
14,null,null,Finally , I reduced the dose myself and .
15,null,null,weaned myself off the Effexor
16,null,null,I had gained a tremendous amount of weight .
17,null,null,I was off all medicines for 8 months
18,null,null,and then I really feel into a dark depression .
19,null,null,It was then that I sought a therapist , etc .
20,null,null,I have been on medicines ever since .. since June of 2004 .
21,null,null,I had lost 40 pounds by going off the medicines , but .
22,depressed,depressed,then became depressed again
23,null,null,following several deaths and major life events .
24,null,null,I was put on Lexapro and .
25,null,null,gained weight
26,null,null,Not wanting to gain weight again , I hated being on the medicines .
27,null,null,He kept saying it will stabilize .
28,null,null,I told him that the weight gain was making me more depressed .
29,null,null,Finally , he changed my medicines to Wellbutrin .
30,null,null,We talked about trying to go off medicines when life events settled down ..
31,null,null,my main reason to go off was the weight gain .
32,null,null,Immediately the weight came back off .
33,null,null,That was a year ago .
34,null,null,Now a year later , I am still losing about a pound or two a month .
35,null,null,The last time I went in , he did not say anything about going off the medicines .
36,null,null,How long do people take medicines ?
37,null,null,Is it just better to stay on them and not fall back into the hole ?
38,null,null,Are there any long - term use side effects to be concerned with ?
39,null,null,Is this something I will probably be on forever ?
40,null,null,It just seems like I will always be like this .
41,null,null,It just seems like depression is always just standing back in the shadows .
42,null,null,I go for a very long time and
43,null,null,feel fine
44,null,null,and then I have a week where I get very down and know that if I was not on medicines .
45,null,null,it would be very bad .
46,null,null,I have not gone to talk to my therapist in a long while .
47,null,null,When I am having these bouts of depression , should I call and .
48,null,null,say I need to go in for a " check - up "
49,null,null,I do not really have any specific issues to discuss .
50,null,null,The big thing right now is I just feel down because I have lost my closest friends and do not feel like I have any friends to do anything with .
51,null,null,I feel so isolated .
52,null,null,Would it be good to just call and go in ?
53,null,null,I just feel stupid saying I feel sad because I do not have any friends .
54,null,null,Are there any good books that you can recommend on self - help -- esp .
55,null,null,negative thinking , understanding why I think the way I do , etc .
56,null,null,I found Dr. Phil is book on Life Strategies to be very helpful in discovering that there are reasons why I do things and think .

1,null,null,Hello out there ..
2,null,null,Ugh .
3,null,null,I battle with depression , anxiety , bulimia , OCPD , BPD , and some physical health issues .
4,null,null,Not so sure about battle right now .
5,null,null,Maybe more like grudgingly coexist with ?
6,null,null,I am 42 .
7,null,null,I have never held a job with the same company for longer than 3 years , and
8,null,null,that was just once .
9,null,null,A few times ( I think )
10,null,null,I have made it to the 2 year mark with a company .
11,null,null,1 year is a bit easier .
12,null,null,I had to quit my last job because it was too easy to use the job to fuel the eating disorder .
13,null,null,( I lost 40 % of my starting weight in about 7 months , before I switched phases and ended up with a pulmonary embolism from refeeding syndrome . )
14,null,null,Right now I am in the initial hurry up and .
15,null,null,deny me so I can get an attorney phase of applying for disability
16,null,null,Thankfully I have a sister who is letting me live in her house , so
17,null,null,at least I am not homeless .
18,null,null,( TBH , most of the time she is out of the country , and when she is here , she is just as selectively social as I am . )
19,null,null,Because of waiting to get on disability , I am off my medicine .
20,null,null,I can not even afford the cheapest ACA insurance , and
21,null,null,even if I had that , I could not afford the copays for my medicine .
22,null,null,I am not eligible for Medicaid in my state until I get approved for SSI / SSDI .
23,null,null,I am not too worried about not having my antidepressants right now tho .
24,null,null,This is probably the most pleasant major depressive episode I have ever had .
25,null,null,It is not so much feeling horrible psychic pain as it is just been a gentle bleeding out of the vibrancy of life .
26,null,null,I sleep as late as I can every day , ( usually until around 1 or so ) , .
27,null,null,hang out in bed playing games , reading , or watching videos , and only really waking up and being willing to be awake around 7 in the evening
28,null,null,I do not feel like I am living anymore .
29,null,null,I am just in a holding pattern .
30,null,null,I think back to what my life was like , even 8 months ago , and
31,depressed,mourn,I mourn for it .
32,null,null,At least I am not suicidal .
33,null,null,I think I just need a place where I can come every so often and unload my mind .
34,null,null,Thanks for sticking around to the end of the post .

1,null,null,Hi .
2,null,null,I am new to the forums .
3,null,null,I was going to lurk for a bit before I posted , but
4,null,null,there is so many of us , ( I mean , I knew .
5,null,null,but I did not know .. you know ?
6,null,null,it seems like the thing to do .
7,null,null,I am a 24 year old male
8,null,null,and I have had problems with depression for as long as I can remember , though it is become worse over the last year or so .

19,null,null,I was pretty heavily involved in music and martial arts for years , but
20,null,null,I am no longer motivated to do either .
21,null,null,I am still going to school , though I have no real direction
22,null,null,and I am afraid that my lack of motivation is going to cause me to screw that up too .
23,null,null,I started having anxiety attacks about a year ago and
24,null,null,they have increased in frequency the last few months .
25,null,null,They are ( not to sound melodramatic )
26,null,null,the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with .
27,depressed,threatening illness,If I am in panic - attack mode , any slight pain or discomfort quickly becomes a life - threatening illness that is surely going to kill me in the next few minutes .
28,null,null,As ridiculous as that sounds , it is absolutely real when it is happening
29,null,null,and I live in almost constant fear it is going to happen again .
30,null,null,I have a hard time even driving anymore ( especially on the freeway ) and increasingly rely on my girlfriend for menial things like going to the store .
31,null,null,She is very supportive and .
32,null,null,is aware that something is wrong , though I do not think she understands to what extent
33,null,null,I have started completely avoiding any situation in which I have to meet new people and have a hard time even talking to people I do not know on the phone .
34,null,null,These symptoms have been increasing in intensity over the last 6 months or so and
35,null,null,exponentially for the last 3 weeks
36,null,null,( I just lost my job ) .
37,null,null,It seems like quite a few of you have been dealing with these sorts of things for much longer
38,null,null,and I am sorry if my posting here so soon seems insensitive , but
39,null,null,its already getting to the point where I know I can not handle living like this for years on end .
40,null,null,I have suffered from depression for ( relative to my age ) a long time and
41,null,null,the anxiety attacks are absolutely terrifying ( a little redundant , I know ) .
42,null,null,It feels like the last year is the beginning of everything completely falling apart .
43,null,null,I guess my posting here is a way to get the ball rolling towards getting some help .
44,null,null,I do not have health insurance anymore and
45,null,null,I am not sure where to go from here .
46,null,null,I have been medicated in the past , but
47,null,null,I have not taken anything in a few years .
48,null,null,Though , without insurance I am not even sure that is an option .
49,null,null,That is enough for now .
50,null,null,Thanks for providing a resource like this .
51,null,null,The anonymity of the internet lets me say some of the things I am afraid to say to everyone else .

8,null,null,that for months after they spiraled out of control .
9,null,null,I am sorry .
10,null,null,I am sorry
11,null,null,I let you down , your family down .
12,null,null,I am sorry I buckled .
13,null,null,I am sorry I did not have the experience or the know - how to react to certain situations .
14,null,null,I am sorry that I made mountains out of molehills .
15,null,null,I am sorry at times
16,null,null,I treated you badly , that at times I held you back .
17,null,null,Three years later , we live totally different lives than back then .
18,null,null,I got that job .
19,null,null,I traveled the world .
20,null,null,I went to Italy - twice .

23,null,null,I did it all , but .
24,null,null,by myself
25,null,null,It is not what I wanted .

30,null,null,It is been three years .
31,null,null,Despite some triumphs and successes , it still feels like I lost a war .
32,null,null,An immense failure that did not personify my persona , it personified myself .
33,null,null,On the surface , I am told I seem ambitious , fully ready to attack each day .
34,null,null,On the inside , I feel defeated .
35,null,null,In the end , you found somebody new , which is fine .
36,null,null,I chose , whether consciously or unconsciously to stay on a different path .
37,null,null,I have tried new women .
38,null,null,Many beautiful on the outside , but
39,null,null,they are not you .
40,null,null,Oh no , no , no .
41,null,null,They all do not have what you had .
42,null,null,Not even close .
43,null,null,Maybe one day I will end this crusade against myself , against the past .
44,null,null,I can not change it
45,null,null,, I can not alter the story , I can not lie to myself .
46,null,null,I wish I could tell you I am sorry .

1,null,null,My cat just got hit by a car I can not even think about it too much .
2,null,null,My family is a little sad but
3,null,null,are kinda telling me to get over it .
4,depressed,terrible depressive spell,I have been in such a terrible depressive spell for the last few weeks and
5,null,null,this just ruined everything .
6,null,null,When older pets die by natural causes I do not cry as much as because I know we gave them the best life and they lived very long but my suki was only 2 years old
7,null,null,she was so fat and adorable
8,null,null,and I can not believe she is gone just because of a bad driver .
9,null,null,She always came to me when I was upset she would lay on top of me and snuggle .
10,null,null,I wish I had more time with her .
11,null,null,now I have almost nothing that makes me smile

3,null,null,When people see me out , I feel so humiliated .
4,null,null,I have to make up some bullshit story about taking a gap year before I embark on a career when really I wanna say well karen
5,null,null,I am clinically depressed as fuck and worn down to the bone by my own thoughts
6,null,null,so thought I should put my life on hold
7,null,null,but no one wants to hear that shit .
8,null,null,I am trying to block out but
9,null,null,it is so hard .
10,null,null,I can not see an end to this , nothing excites me that much anymore
11,null,null,and the thought of getting a proper career job terrifies me .

 (3, 2),
1,null,null,Sadness is the only thing getting me through my day I am not really sure where to talk about this because the people in my life do not really understand .
2,null,null,I feel like I messed up a lot of my life and the track it was going on .
3,depressed,disappointed and sad,Now I am just very disappointed and sad with myself .
4,null,null,I have tried pills and therapy .
5,null,null,However , this might sound weird , but
6,null,null,my sadness is the only thing pulling me through the day and making it pass by quickly .
7,null,null,I do not know how to explain it because most people associate sadness with something they instantly want .

 (130, 121),
1,null,null,I just really need to vent ..
2,null,null,For a start , I understand everyone in life are at different levels and that depression and anxiety is different for everyone and I am in no way stating who has it worst or better .
3,null,null,I have taken hours and hours of training in it
4,null,null,and I am not here to speak or preach about how to help ..
5,null,null,In a rare occasion in my life I am asking for help , guidance
6,null,null,, I do not know the correct word
7,null,null,but maybe if I explain myself a bit it may help .
8,null,null,This maybe long
9,null,null,and I do apologize
10,null,null,but I just need to say all of this SOMEWHERE ..
11,null,null,I am gay guy that recently moved from a conservative town in Montana to the amazing city of Portland , OR .
12,null,null,I came out of the closet the summer going into my freshman year of high school , dealt with a ( simply put ) shitty childhood while growing up in the Bible Belt of northern Florida , with an abusive father and worrying , even at the age of 7/8 about how my future would play out in this .
13,null,null,My mom divorced and and .
14,null,null,remarried a man that does not accept my sexuality personally but supports my life decision
15,null,null,says he loves me
16,null,null,We moved to Montana ( my mom , me and him ) and
17,null,null,I began to feel like I did have a purpose when I was introduced to acting onstage at a local theatre that I fell in love with .
18,null,null,Life , for a few years , was amazing but
19,null,null,my high school at the time was having a crisis .
20,null,null,Unfortunately four students had committed suicide between my freshman and junior year and , .
21,null,null,with the help of many , started a suicide awareness program in the city and lead that for a year or so
22,null,null,My senior year , literally three days before it started , my military brother committed suicide on base , it was suspected it was also his sexuality .
23,null,null,But also in my senior year , near the end of it , I met a man whom I fell in love with
24,null,null,( which is what I am getting too , just bare with me ) .
25,null,null,We were able to spend a lot of time together for a month or two before he had to leave to Portland
26,null,null,( before I had gone ) for a work internship where he would go back home to Brazil once completed .
27,null,null,He treats me like gold , and
28,null,null,I really mean that , he has been nothing but amazing to me .
29,null,null,He flew me out to Portland
30,null,null,so I could visit him for two weeks where we fell even more in love .
31,null,null,Everything was shattered when he left for home
32,null,null,and I also left for an adventure .
33,null,null,After I graduated , I had the amazing opportunity to go to the BEAUTIFUL island of Taiwan , where I spent an amazing year learning Chinese ( Mandarin ) , meeting people all around the world , experiencing a new culture for the first time , it was indeed a life changing time for me .
34,null,null,But it was not easy for my boyfriend and
35,null,null,I. We fought in occasion , texting makes it really hard to communicate emotions , and
36,null,null,we only had about two hours out of our days to talk due to the harsh time zone differences .
37,null,null,The year went by quite quickly and
38,null,null,he surprised me with yet another plane ticket to Portland where he would also land only two hours after I did
39,null,null,and we would be together again .
40,null,null,It was only for two weeks again
41,null,null,but I felt complete ..
42,null,null,He even proposed on the Fourth of July .
43,null,null,He was yanked away from me again soon after and
44,null,null,it tore me down .
45,null,null,My heart crumbled .
46,null,null,My next chapter in life had started once I arrived back from Taiwan and had seen my boyfriend again .
47,null,null,I had decided I wanted to move to a Portland permanently
48,null,null,, found a decent student housing apartment , enrolled for school
49,null,null,, I was excited .. now this is where things become a bit much for me and why I am here today .
50,null,null,My , now fianc , was able to stay with me for a full month this time .
51,null,null,Now at this point I am sure you wonder ( if you are still reading ) , why does not he move here ?
52,null,null,, or why do not you move there ?
53,null,null,Here is why : He was on an exchange program when I met him that the Brazilian government paid for .
54,null,null,The requirement for that visa is that he must stay in Brazil for two years before he can legally move back into the USA .
55,null,null,In other words , he is stuck there while I am stuck here both separated and both in fear of him being rejected .
56,null,null,We applied for the fianc visa and
57,null,null,now we are waiting for the approval .
58,null,null,I refuse to move where he lives because of how high the crime rate is and due to Brazil
59,null,null,is economic status
60,null,null,, we both agreed it would not be good for a white American target to live in a high crime area .
61,null,null,I know I have talked a lot about my fianc
62,null,null,but here is also what is going on on my hands as well that I just was not ready for .
63,null,null,Before I moved to Portland , I had to go to urgent care because I had no primary doctor and no money , only Medicaid , which they took .
64,null,null,I went three times for small bumps on my hands that turned out to be stressed induced and
65,null,null,all three times I went
66,null,null,the doctors said I have no idea !
67,null,null,Try using lotions and !
68,null,null,see what happens
69,null,null,Nodded their heads and .
70,null,null,left
71,null,null,Very pointless
72,null,null,but when I got the bill I was shocked and confused .
73,null,null,I thought my Medicaid had covered it , which it did not because while I was out of country my Medicaid had expired and no one told me about it , therefore I was left with a $ 600 bill .
74,null,null,I heard it off for a while because I had other things to deal with than the bullshit that the hospital was giving me about it .
75,null,null,Around this time as well , I moved in with my best friend due to a dispute I had with my parents , which really crumbled me , but
76,null,null,they still do not know how upset I am about it .
77,null,null,I moved to Portland ..
78,null,null,and now I believe I am regretting it
79,null,null,..
80,null,null,I moved with that same best friend where we would also share the space with two others , a couple from Hawaii .
81,null,null,We had Skyped then ahead of time in our excitement of moving and
82,null,null,we were all excited to meet each other .
83,null,null,I had a job lined up for me as a barista , I had a savings plan lined up for what I could and could not spend for money , school would be starting soon , things were looking pretty nice !
84,null,null,Well .. it is not nice .
85,null,null,Not nice at all .
86,null,null,The Hawaiian couple does not like my friend and I.
87,null,null,They stop our oven mittens and , and ..
88,null,null,tried to say they were there is and hid them from us ,
89,null,null,refused to let us use the garbage can in the kitchen
90,null,null,held little meetings about what it is we were doing wrong and how we could fix it
91,null,null,I was so thrown back
92,null,null,I ignore them at any chance and .
93,null,null,even had to take time out of my life to tell them how upsetting it is we had reached a level they had where to actually put sticky notes on things we could touch and could not touch
94,null,null,I find myself to be quite tidy and clean and fair
95,null,null,but I guess there are two sides of the story always .
96,null,null,That is the first thing .
97,null,null,That job I had lined up as a barista ?
98,null,null,Big joke ..
99,null,null,I met with the boss who said the store is not open yet and .
100,null,null,asked if I wanted to be a cashier for the university instead
101,null,null,I said why not , the pay was amazing at $ 12.75 an hour and had benefits .
102,null,null,I did my on - boarding and .
103,null,null,was quite interested
104,null,null,First day on the job however they lied and .
105,null,null,put me in food service where I was demanded around by two chefs and four managers who did not know what the fuck they were doing
106,null,null,One of the chef is actually spilt boiling grease on my foot and .
107,null,null,did not even apologize
108,null,null,The other chef was racist and .
109,null,null,talked bad about the Indian workers
110,null,null,so much I had to leave his presence
111,null,null,It was a toxic environment .
112,null,null,Income tax in Oregon was so high
113,null,null,I was not able to afford my apartment and .
114,null,null,realized I need to be working minimum wage to sincerely support myself here
115,null,null,I left after a month and .
116,null,null,am now struggling on finding a full time again
117,null,null,On a side note , because of costs and issues with finding a co - signed for a loan , I had to pull my enrollment for school as well .
118,null,null,That is the second ..
119,null,null,When my fianc came to visit me for a month , my best friend / roommate was very difficult ..
120,null,null,it is a harsh word to use
121,null,null,but she has a lot of learning to do .
122,null,null,I have been on my own since I was 16 in doing things myself ( with the exception of paying my phone bill and buying a car ) .
123,null,null,Taxes , jobs , appointments , etc . , were all me .
124,null,null,She needs some help getting there
125,null,null,and she has done and
126,null,null,amazing job to get there
127,null,null,but .. every opportunity I hand her to take one more step of becoming independent
128,null,null,she rejects and .
129,null,null,shuts down completely
130,depressed,jealous and upset,The whole month was very hard for my fianc and I over how jealous and upset she got
131,null,null,and it was too much .
132,null,null,Currently she is back home for Christmas and
133,null,null,I am alone and quite frankly I needed it .
134,null,null,I just do not know how to handle that situation .
135,null,null,It was as if she was using her emotions against me
136,null,null,and it was poisonous .
137,null,null,It go so bad
138,null,null,my fianc and
139,null,null,Igor
140,null,null,an Airbnb our last two nights together
141,null,null,so it could just be me and him .
142,null,null,That is the third .. I had to go to the emergency room as well when my fianc was here due to yet another kidney stone .
143,null,null,I got one in the 7th grade , near the end of my exchange program and one in a restaurant where the pain was so bad I needed to call an ambulance
144,null,null,..
145,null,null,more money on shit
146,null,null,I can not afford .
147,null,null,I can go on and on with these stories
148,null,null,but I need to get to this ..
149,null,null,it is my anxiety .
150,null,null,I was diagnosed with depression in high school but .
151,null,null,was taken off of medication
152,null,null,I was doing actually quite well !
153,null,null,But most recently , with everything that is been going on , it is gotten really really bad .
154,null,null,I am constantly anxed about everything ..
155,null,null,when I walk down the street , I fear what people look at me as .
156,null,null,Now I am not fat , I would say I am average but my cheeks are so puffy
157,null,null,and it really embarrasses me to even look in a mirror .
158,null,null,I am constantly wondering why my fianc wants to be with me , if he is cheating on me , lied to me , etc .
159,null,null,I over stress about the smallest smallest things .
160,null,null,Example : I cried and .
161,null,null,broke down because I failed my drivers test for the Oregon license
162,null,null,I physically felt like I was going to die or
163,null,null,the end of the world was happening ..
164,null,null,why ?
165,null,null,Why was that happening to me ?
166,null,null,Why is this ALL happening to me ?
167,null,null,I miss my fianc , I can not get stable
168,null,null,, I now starting out as an adult is not supposed to be easy but
169,null,null,guys ..
170,null,null,this is really hard .
171,null,null,I spend any day I have off in bed
172,null,null,and I have only had one meal within two days .
173,null,null,I know I need help
174,null,null,but I do not have the money for it or the time .
175,null,null,I have never felt this insecure about my life , future , body , everything .
176,null,null,I feel like I am climbing up an escalator that is going the wrong way , and
177,null,null,no amount of running will get me to the top .
178,null,null,I do not know where else to go or who to talk to .
179,null,null,I feel like I have annoyed everyone already enough about me that I no longer want to talk to literally anyone .
180,null,null,My fianc sometimes even .
181,null,null,Well if you have made it this far I thank you sincerely ..
182,null,null,I just really needed to vent .

13,null,null,When she came back from the store , she decided she would have the ambulance come and pick him up because he REALLY needed to go in .
14,null,null,Slurring his words , despite actually being sober in the mornings .
15,null,null,When she went back to get his consent over phone to get picked up for the ambulance , he was out cold already .
