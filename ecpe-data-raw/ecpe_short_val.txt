2,null,null," Got into a discussion with my SO because of my depression / anxiety
3,null,null,They told me I do not have it bad enough
4,null,null,and if I were worse off I would get my shit together .
5,null,null,So something in me snaps
6,null,null,and I admit I would actually rather be dead ( whoops ) .
7,depressed,want to die,This leads to them telling me I am only thinking about myself and asking me how I believe they feel when I tell them I want to die .
8,null,null,Anyone else got to hear stuff like this ?

1,null,null,Constant battle between ambition and .
2,null,null,not wanting to live
3,depressed,suicial thoughts,Since I was about 12 I have had recurring suicidal thoughts .
4,null,null,The thing is , I do not have low self esteem or anything of that sort , it is actually quite the opposite
5,null,null,and I always joke about being a narcissist .
6,null,null,I may not be an actual narcissist , but
7,null,null,I have always had a slight superiority complex .
8,null,null,I do not hate myself , but
9,null,null,I just hate my life and the continuous chore known as living .
10,null,null,On the outside , I have always been the life of the party , but
11,null,null,deep down I do not ever remember being happy .
12,null,null,As someone who is highly ambitious , it feels as if there is a never ending struggle between wanting to be successful enough to be well known or have an impact on the world , and wanting to stop existing .
13,null,null,Yet with the prospect of the latter , comes the failure of the former .
14,null,null,I know that if I lowered my expectations in life I would be mildly happier , yet the thought of settling for mediocrity gives me horrible anxiety and fills me with dread .
15,null,null,Recently things have gotten worse due to my university workload .
16,null,null,I have been having trouble completing assignment and .
17,null,null,functioning in general
18,null,null,I have considered getting help
19,null,null,but I feel deeply uncomfortable at the thought of opening up to someone , since I am not a very emotional person .
20,null,null,I have come to accept that I will probably never be happy .
21,null,null,I have always wondered if I would be more likely to actually commit suicide if I ever attained the level of success
22,null,null,I desire since I would have then achieved my goal in life , or if that would finally bring me the contentment I seek .
23,null,null,I suppose it would be the former since I can never be content .

1,depressed,negative mood,Unstuck yourself I used to be stuck in negative mood and had suicide plan at one point .
2,null,null,I did not see the point of doing anything nor meaning of life itself .
3,null,null,One day a light bulb went off .
4,null,null,I realize the world is much bigger than any of us could see or imagine from our corner at a given time .
5,null,null,We should not refuse to do things just because we do not understand the point .
6,null,null,Instead we should celebrate the gift we are given .
7,null,null,Just go do things because we CAN !
8,null,null,If you are lonely , go talk to a homeless person .
9,null,null,You will be surprised how much you could learn .
10,null,null,If someone did you wrong at one time , forgive them and .
11,null,null,live for the future
12,null,null,Life has so much for us to explore .
13,null,null,The trick is to start on one thing .
14,null,null,Put left foot before right foot , then next ..
15,null,null,You will feel better soon once you stop feeling by start doing .

3,null,null,He s my dude .
4,null,null,And when he s busy I have friends to fall back on as well .
5,null,null,Recently the whole family got back to back sickness and
6,null,null,we were basically quarantined for two weeks just bumming around trying to get better .
7,null,null,So I let my kid watch too much tv , let my husband play all the video games , so i could do my stuff with out being bothered as well .
8,null,null,Let me also say , I did nt plant my kid in front of the tv for hours on end , but
9,null,null,I have to shower , and keep up with the house because man colds are much more sever ( no .. ) .
10,null,null,Now that were better his behaviors have continued , even though i have spoke to him many times ; things wo nt be like this when were not longer sick .
11,null,null,My kid is not a tv kid and
12,null,null,I plan to keep it that way as long as I can ..
13,null,null,but he ..
14,null,null,he does not want to spend time with me any more , just step away from electronics and just chill and talk and play with our kid together ..
15,null,null,so I wanted to talk to my friends or even my mom ..
16,null,null,and I realized I do not have very many friends .
17,null,null,EDIT :

1,depressed,sad,I feel like I am a terrible person for being sad
2,null,null,My life is going fine : I have solid grades , I hardly have to study , and
3,null,null,I am financially stable .
4,null,null,However , even though everything is going great I am still sad every day , and .
5,null,null,spend a lot of time thinking about how to kill myself
6,null,null,No one notices that I am sad , and
7,null,null,everyone thinks I must be really happy about how everything is going , and it just makes me feel worse that I can not be happy even when I have everything : every victory is hollow and ever action feels pointless .
8,null,null,I do not even know who to talk to about this because I do not want to bother anyone , people have enough to worry about without me involving them in my problems , especially small ones like my feelings .
